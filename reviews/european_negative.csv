"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
"especially in summer this restaurant is the place to be, visited by village people and tourists. you can enjoy sunshine until Â± 20:00 hr "
"large portions but not very good food. 12 ribs but dry. small, overcooked mussels in watery sauce. salad mainly iceberg lettuce. do yourself a favour and walk a minute further to it posthuswhich which does much better quality for similar price."
"this is located on a nice square in makkum.   the food is average, a typical dutch menu so little imagination.  its ok if you need somewhere to eat."
"for dinners with a eur 18-20 tag i would expect well good food. however overcooked steak (medium was requested), schnitzel was soggy of oil (not crisp) and plate was floating of the oil the potatoes was cooked in. however there are carrots and a salad as a side dish, so plenty of food. "
"food in makkum is pretty much the same, wherever you go...some places do some things better than others. this place has huge portions (normal around here) but they arent terrific. it is a good place to hang out, have drinks & people watch. the best staffmember is angelique, shes super friendly, fun, and genuinely cares about her customers. sime of the others could use an attitude adjustment! but you can usually find a table outside to sit in the sun, & the beer/wine is good."
"we stopped here one evening for a quick bite to eat. we found a table outside and were quickly served with our drinks - i had the enigmatically named wieckse witte wheat beer. the waitress who took our order was friendly enough but seemed to have her mind on other things. my order of plaice arrived without the special request for extra chips and it took some time to get any cutlery. the food was luke warm at best. my companion decided only to go for the tomato soup and hot chocolate with a pile of cream on top. that was ok, she said. with a bill close to 30 euro i wasnt really that impressed. next time we eat in makkum well try one of the other restaurants..."
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
"the food is not fantastic but reasonable priced. the people running are quitte blunt and seemed to be stressed, overworked. on a sunny day there is a serious line at a window where you have to order and pay. and although there is stated you can pay by bankcard (pin) and cash, i would strongly advice cash. the mobile network is for some reason in that place very very bad, sometimes your mobile gives no connection and their bankcard system is depending on it...so you would not be the first that walks away empty handed after a 15 min wait. is not helping the atmospher "
it is very nice to sit outside and watch the shoppers pass by at the plaza. food is not remarkable and often close to dutch snacks but it is a good place to be.
"i live in the area and pop into this restuarant from time to time. ive always found the food good, the wasabi mayonaise burger is pretty good and i found the lamb rack really really go "
bad food and no vegetarian dishes and when they were willing to amend a plate they had run out of pasta/rice. my salad with marinated beef wasnt tender at all. not going there a second time for dinner.
"this typical amsterdam snack shop sits exactly on the border of amsterdam and amstelveen. it has the usual selecton of inexpensive dutch snacks and nibbles, as well as warm and cold sandwhiches, including burgers and chicken sandwiches. there is a lovely patio if the afternoon sun is shining, otherwise it has small indoor seating, or a walk-up/carry-out counter. there is free parking on one side, pay parking on the other. plenty of space for bicycles. very close to then entrance of the amsterdamse bos (amsterdam forest)."
"small restaurant in the middle of amstelveen, right outside amsterdam. parking is a bit sketchy if you come by car. the restaurants interior is ok but nothing to write home about. we were there about 2 hours ago so everything is still fresh in my mind. because were a friday evening the restaurant was packed and extremely noisy. making a reservation is recommended. my wife and i had read good reviews so we went in with expectatio "
it was nice pizza and vibe but the manager was quite rude to the family beside us taking away the menus for the desert because they spent too much time make the pizza. the manager was verbally fighting back and not showing respect to the customers 
"kai the manager was already so rude on the phone that we were repelled straight away. even for dutch standards this is absolutely poor. asking me on the phone what time i want to join, me telling the time and then being told that actually theyre fully booked is not okay. why even bother to ask me then?! and then giving me a speech. not okay. either you have a table or not, but then please say so straight away and dont talk back to your guest and give an attitude."
"when we arrived the restaurant was full with families with kids. but we were offered a table at the window. they sell wine only by the glass of bottle, no caraf. the wine was great. they serve only pizza and no pasta. we ordered the diavola and four chees "
"i love surinamese food. this is simply not it. wrong flavours, bad ingredients, and not fresh. its the only surinamese place in the area, that is all it has going for it."
it only takes one bad experience with a cashier to make you never darken the door again. seriously after years of going i will find another cafe in the area.
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill 
"fantastic food and service generally friendly, but made several mistakes with the orders and as a result we had a very long wait for our meal without any recognition.  a shame as the food was excellent."
"food was ok, nothing outstanding, specially considering the pric "
june 5th we had a special celebration and our first choice restaurant was closed so we decided to go to de jonge dikkert as friends had recently recommended the fo 
"as i live close to this beautiful restaurant, ive been to this restaurant regularly. as i really liked the atmosphere and quality of the food, i booked this restaurant for a business meeting. what a disappointment it was. first of all, not all food was properly cooked, leaving me with a semi-raw langoustine. second of all, one of the waiters a) didnt at all know what he was serving and b) didnt have a clue about the accompanying wine and finally staff my dietary request was completely forgotten when serving the cheese platt "
i can only describe our experience as very disappointi 
"when we arrived we were greeted courteously, but then we were seated somewhere away in a corner, although we had reserved. so we asked to be moved as we like to soak up the atmosphere. the atmosphere was really good, relaxed and its easy to have a conversation. the tables are also nicely spread out so that you dont have the feeling that someone can listen into your conversati "
"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.
we went to this place for lunch and had okay-ish pancakes. location is perfect for a break while shopping in the mall.
had lunch here earlier this week with my best frie 
super slow service which is amazing for a shopping center restaurant.  more for snacks than a meal.  the rose beer was good.
this restaurant in the shopping area of amstelveen (stadshart) was stablished after a renovation of one section of the restaurants area finished some time a 
"the name of this restaurant means without worry. i guess when we visited, staff was taking that too seriously. we had to wait 10 minutes and ask 3 more times to get the high chair offered to us when we came in, and it took them even more to come and take a drinks ord "
this is a smart well decorated restaurant but the quantity of gnocchi with bolognaise sauce was insufficient for a starter and i ordered it as a main. suggest you choose the chinese next door and get some decent food.
our hotel recommended this one and it was full of tourists from other hotels that recommended it. the wait staff were disagreeable with each other and it carried over into their service. the food came out on time but we were stressed after our dinner from the cold atmosphere in the room. we ordered the main course ravioli to share as an appetizer and it was goodâone large piece of ravioli. we ordered the grilled fish sampler for main course. the sole was good as was the tuna and shrimp but the salmon was over cooked. we ate at some terrific restaurants and cafes during our three days here and this was one i would skip.
the coffee is okay however the big plus are restroom facilities which are in short supply in this center.  a good place to catch up with friends
place is packed with people and youd have to get your kids to eat their pancakes while standing. pancakes themselves are nice but not thrilling ( quite fattening ).
"the pancakes are great, well cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! the bacon cheese is very good and so is the spicy..they offer gluten-free pancake (if you order in the morni "
a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."
since years the quality of food is abominabl 
for first time since 2 years ordered the pancakes. my husband ordered qp me 
"a hotel that charges 120 eu for a one night stay for 2 persons in one of their single person rooms, which are expanded as double room, with an old matras, no airco and cloths as towels, should be fined. the breakfast consits out of old bread, too long cooked eggs and aqueous coffee and lacks a buffet. we couldnt leave this place faster, a shame for amstelveen."
access for tourists via public transport (ov or openbare vervoer) is difficult. but well worth the effort for the succulent and unlimited (onbeperkt) spareribs - a backpackers paradi 
"super great food, and big portions. but the staff was not very professional, we sat inside under the stairs and ashes of a cigarette fell from upstairs on our table. we told the staff and they did nothing to compensate, very bad. not planning to go back! "
very bad service. long wait for being served. we left after the main course after being 2 hours in the restaurant. very bad experience.
"the first thing we got told: no, you cannot sit at your prefered table because then i have to walk too much. that set the scene for the evening: every cause was delivered with some error, drinks missing for the apÃ©ritif, bread missing with the starter, fries missing with the main meal, the fries finally arrived after asking twice and when we all had finished the me "
"the place is really very average, the amuse we got tasted very much like supermarket spreadable sausage that was a bit dressed up. the starter of ossenworst ( spiced raw beef) tartaar conceptionally was interesting but the final result turned out to be a bit of the traditional ossenworst with some dressing on t "
"to begin with the most positive: beautiful location, nice quiet atmosphere. but thats it unfortunately. the concept is unclear: starters and main course are tiny (even for a starter!). so after two courses a healthy stomach is certainly not satisfied. the quality was not convincing. my tuna looked like chewing gum, the pork belly was nearly all fat. apart from that, the prices are really high compared to what is being offered. perhaps kronenburg is the restaurant for tourists who are willing to pay the price but as a citizen of amstelveen i must conclude that there are better and less expensive restaurants to go to."
"perhaps it was the fact that we were a very large group that caused the food to be a disappointment. the first impressions of the kronenburg are very favourable- a stylish exterior and a spacious, quality interior. the place has that air of quality about it. unfortunately the food was largely uninspiring. a decent carpaccio of scallops was a good start but the duck (tough) and hare (very tough) did nothing for the palate. an anonymous ice cream based pudding also lacked any substance or taste. i am sure the quality of food is better than we experienced but it may better when the groups are not so large."
"i reviewed this restaurant on 12 november 2015 and at that time was pleasantly surprised. however our recent visit was a disappointment, especially for the service rendered. the food was not bad, but also nothing to brag about. for a refill of our wine, we had to ask three or four times. the appetizer came in a reasonable time, but for the main course, i had to get up and inquire what happened to our order. when it finally came it was just above room temperature. we were not in the mood anymore for a desert."
food was good but unremarkable. the young waiter was perhaps just a bit too eager to please- pushed us for chips and wine when we had indicated that we were happy with our order choice. venue was quite smart with welcoming staff at the front desk. overall fine for a quick business lunch so would go again.
"had a great evening here with good friends one of them having a glut allergy. after a poor amuse (courgette kerry cake), a nice tuna tartar, a tasty lobster / steak, followed by a good looking desert. however, glut free coffee sweets were not available in spite of an upfront reservation. service friendly, fine ambiance with lots of space. overall a nice experience but could be better ..."
"the location is good.. a man made lake and green trees, with an outside terrace and a cozy minimalist modern interior design... but the food was the turn down.. ive been to hundreds of different restaurants in netherlands but this one is my absolute dissapointment.. taste is bland and plain, no beauty in the food presentation, size is unimpressive.. overall so dissapointing.. loetje should take over this restaurant and use the awesome location and building.."
"the location is the only thing that enjoyable while i dont know why there are many waitresses there serving food that wasnt even deserve to be called food.. tasteless, amount is like starter for a main course and dessert that looked like it can be bought in supermarket and no efforts of art put in it whatsoever "
"the good and quick behavior of the room staff cannot mask the low capability of the kitchen: the grilled mix is not grilled at all, the french fries are not french at all, the vegetarian dishes are not attractive..."
"menu and decor and staff all the same. pleasant waiters, easy wine, no advise with combi food and wine. food is simple and ok. close to hotel and around the area not much other choice"
"nice is quite nice. nice and friendly waitress and the food was nice.  nothing super special just quick, ok food at a very reasonable price."
i had watered-down onion soup with a cheese bread topping that you couldnt bite i 
"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "
place looks quite nice but limited menu. not very busy but still they managed to forget to bring veg with mail course. ruined the meal. i used to go before the rebranding and reopening but never again. owners need to check and train staff. our table were not the only ones having issues that evening...

ive been year for a dinner with some collegues during a business trip in amstelv 
"this restaurant is next to the grand hotel in amstelveen (less than a minute walk) and is basically the only place to eat when you dont want to go somewhere else by car or taxi. service and food are good, but nothing really outstanding. its perfect for a quick dinner after a long day of work. staff speaks fluentl english, so easy also for foreign guests."
"this bistro may be nice, but not more than that. it seems to cater mainly to visitors of the nearby hotel (no restaurant of its own) and of the sports complex as there is nothing else around. i gu "
"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
ive visited this place several times and yesterday was the worst out of a 
"after the starters we have to see the whole restaurant getting food but us. after informing at a waiter he said it would be there in a minute, after 10 minutes we informed at another waiter who actually went to the kitchen. we saw about 40 people getting served (also people who entered the place much later) before we finally got the main course. they were just in time, we were about to lea "
"nice place to be, i think its mostly after work drinks and diner. diner is good, but not surprising. its pub like / eetcafÃ©. waitresses are experienced and understand their job."
"after a walk we ended up here for a drink. ordered also vegetarian burger that was disappointed. it was not fresh prepared, they fried and not baked. the salad with it was tasteless and almost no dressing the french fries where to hard. in bother words very disappointing for 12 euro. the service was friendly "
you have never ever seen ribs this size and they are like something from the flint stones. good food and value for a family.  not gone fine dining. but worth a visit if youre very hungry!
this place has been the same ever since i first visited it in 2003. nothing really changed on the inside or the menu. still i am going back there several times a year just because it is what it is. famous for its sate and nothing more. it is really good thoug 
"this eatery is totally devoid of any sophistication. the entourage is chaotic rather than cosy, and the staff indifferent rather than inattenti "
"i dont recommend this restaurant for asiana family. we went there, and the waitresses treated us very rude. it was a kind of discrimination i feel. the treat local dutch people very nice, but not to asiana. i dont suggest asiana people to visit this restaurant."
"we visited this restaurant twice and both times the service was bad. very unfriendly and rude staff, but the food is really good."
"donât go to this restaurant after 9:00 because you will probably get rude treatment. my husband and i were craving good italian so we came here. we arrived quite late because we were traveling far, so we understood the inconvenience. when we came in, everyone stared at us like we were the worst for coming in that late. we asked the waitress if it was too late and said we didnât have to stay, but she said âweâre happy youâre hereâ and looked like she meant it so we thought, âgreat weâll have a nice dinner but eat quickly so they donât have to stay late for us. that was the last bit of friendliness we received. they sat us in the corner and took so long to bring menus or drinks. everyone else in the almost full restaurant was enjoying themselves and still eating when we sat down. the main waiter was refilling wine glasses, bringing people complimentary chocolates and laughing with other customers. obviously not in a hurry to leave. but he did not acknowledge us or welcome us. he just came by with a paper and looked at us to take our order. when he took it he left without a smile. we spent about $55 for the most uncomfortable, nice tasting italian food weâve ever had. all we wanted to do was leave. they made us feel so out of place. we ate and left before some of the others had even finished their wine and they were still cold to us as we left. we couldnât help but notice the waiter brought everyone a plate of chocolates with their check, but never brought us one. the food was fine but not worth it for our horrible experience. my husband ordered the pumpkin ravioli which doesnât have meat but was still 16 euros. it was very good, but i ordered a pasta with âbaconâ which ended up being thick pieces of pork that had a strange flavor. me least favorite meal of the whole trip. "
very popular restaurant  but the children enjoyed. not a brilliant location but near lots of housing.  service was good.
a friend wanted to eat itali 
"veri saporiÂ´s main attraction is passionate owner mario bianco. heÂ´s a fun host and our first visit a year ago was a great experience. sadly, it seems the rave reviews soon after opening this restaurant has lead to complacancy. our last visit this month was a major disappointment. our waiter seemed uninterested. his choice of wine was totally off and the dishes were ok, but otherwise uninspiring. we could have done better cooking ourselves and weÂ´re no master chefs. as the prices are quite hefty, we expect better from mario!"
if you can live with some traditional slow dutch service the food will compensate. fantastic pastas with the spaghetti vengole as the clear favorite in a nice ambiance with a lot of people despite the fact that we booked a table already at 1800. we will most likely be back but not at peak hours...
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
i recently visited grand cafe oude dorp and the fact it was completely empty on a thursday mid morning raised alarm bells. it did get gradually busier but that only amounted to about 4/5 tables being occupied. my friend and i were served by a surly waitress who seemed bothered by our presence despite being the only customers in the restaurant and when i found a hair in my salad (that needless to say did not belong to me) she merely told me sheâd bring me another plate. no apology was made and we were left well alone until we decided to get up to pay for our brunch. the food itself quite tasty and fairly generous in portion sizes but my friend and i both vowed never to go back there.
"right from the start the server just did not want to serve us. never smiled from entrance to leaving the restaurant. we questioned our bill at the end as we didnt believe we got an extra fries but there was 3 portions in two bowls, figure that one out... we would come back for the food but will stay well clear because of the service. life is to short and there are too many choices of good restaurants in the area."
"went there for a dinner, sat outdoor- nice view of oud dorp - and had an enjoyable meal. the menu offer a variety of dishes from snacks, vegan to international cuisine. i had spare ribs that were good. a good selection of wines an beers also availab "
"a place where you should pick anything fancy from the menu. the slibtong, sole was below average. the simple dishes were ok"
"the cafÃ© is located in the old part of amstelveen, close to the poel lake and city hall. its dÃ©cor is somewhat dark, which comes across as 70s style, however the seating is spacious and comfortable. no problem to have a quiet/confidential conversatio "
never ever going there again . i asked for a small portion of food (from kids menu) because i had recently a surgery and i cannot eat a lot . of course the âbossâ how waiter called him was really rude and couldnât accept this . in this way you canât keep the customers happy !! never ever come back here and iâm not recommend to no one . 
"poor quality for what you get, i was waiting 15minutes inside for someone to ask what i would like to drink or eat, they had like 6-7 people on the tables. my wife had a gastric sleeve surgery and she asked if she can get kids menu, the owner come and said you have to order from adults. waiters and owner very rude, avoid this place"
"club sandwich was not filled or spreaded at the edges, bread was soooo dry i hurt my mouth, 1 slice of bacon and one of the thinnest smoked chicken ham slice i ever saw."
"rude approach from unfriendly and unprofessional personnel. we arrived with about half an hour delay, apologizing because of that, and with 4 people instead of the planned 6 (and again, we gave our apologies). the tone of the waiter who welcomed us was aggressive and sarcastic, and he made us feeling quite uncomfortable, especially because it was a business lunch with our customer. the food was average, nothing special. i will definitely not recommend this place, there are better options in the area of schiphol oost."
"they were unable to provide individual bills although the reservation was made for more than 15 people. of course announced at checkout. no apologies and quite aggressive tone. obviously they dont care as the only choice in this area is the steigenberger hotels restaurant or them. its a pity as the food is quite good (even if we have been waiting one hour!). please change the way you are handling you guests, guys!"
"recently had lunch here with a business partner. in all fairness, the location is great and it has a lot of historic feeling to it, the restaurant is inside the former control tower of the old schiphol airport part, where it all started. however, the lunch was so so. the onion soups we ordered were a little watery and also the cheese did not have that nice thick and grilled layer that one expects of onion soups. both our sandwiches were average, we had a grilled brie sandwich and a grilled goat cheese sandwich. they were served with a lot of bread but not in balance with the amount of cheese. so, either provide more cheese or provide less bread. i would prefer the first, and would be prepared to even pay more for that. i also noticed that the brie was slightly overgrilled, so that could also improve. did not try other things, i think i will give it a second chance and try some other stuff, and see if they have improved. judging by the crowd, maybe it was just a bad experience from our side, as there were many guests in any case. service was nice and friendly, and that also made up for the average food experience."
new level of service in this restaurant. we made an order and ok sometimes mistakes can be made and some items might be wrong or forgotten. how likely is it that they will forget the full order? well they did. the waitress just didnt put it through. just like that. she didnt even come to apologise for forgetting. if you like sitting on your table forever like an idiot with no one bringing your food or coffee this is the place to com 
"first time in lpq in aâveen and never again. i normally go to groot gelderlandplein or in ams/ de pijp where service is outstanding and food is well prepared and proportions are generous.in aveen this experience is totally reversed. me and my friend ordered a caesar salad but to my great surprise it was not prepared with slices of real chicken but thin slices of cheap packaged cooked chicken slices and on some slices you could clearly see the veins. in addition the salad was full of big bacon cubes which had an overbearing taste in the salad.while we were eating our meal we were asked to change tables in order to allow a bigger group to take a seat! then there is the noise problem , since tables are very close to one another you do not have sufficient space and therefore lack privacy.nevertheless i maintained a calm demeanor in order to not spoil the mome "
"waitresses ignore the customers, even when you call them politely they act like a deaf and donât respo "
"it is such a pity this shop doesnât know the basics of customer experience. after a 5 minutes wait to be seated, nobody came. even if we saw 5 waiters, nobody dared saying hello. we then left to go to hema restaurant which was a nice experience (playground for kids, nice food and not expensive at all)."
will never visit again. appalling experience compared to other stores in the franchise. recommend to avoid.
"definitely worth a visit for a quick bite, everything fresh and very good quality. usually crowded, take away to be considered"
well placed outside the amstelveen mall area close to the monday and wednesday markets. the restaurant outside area is enclosed - inside can be noisy with the wooden floor and no soft furnishings.
"pain quotidien serves great breakfast: tartines, bread and fruit.  today our experience was sub-par: the staff was not attentive (maybe they had a great party last night) and the place was full of mosquitoes. so we quickly are our food and left."
"- ingredients were high quality, but less quantity - bad server - high price location for netherlande"
only stopped in for quick snacks during a shopping visit. clearly a place which treats young families well as the place was full of young children. the snacks were not very expensive but actually were not great value : 10 euro for an incredibly average open sandwich . one of those places you put down to experience and look for an alternative next time 
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
the service is absolutely appalling. iâve been sat here for an hour and only been asked what i want to drink.   if you want good / fast service then go else where. this isnât the first time.
"we were here on a sunday and none of us spoke any dutch (which we made very clear to the extremely rude waiter). we ordered two plates of the pasta gambas. we found out after eating (because i managed to google translate that the dish shouldve included mussels which it didnt), that this day apparently was the restaurants leftovers of the week-day - they served us the leftovers from that week and the waiter didnt tell us earlier. when i complained, he said, the leftover-day was announced on the first page of the menu. we made it very clear to him none of us spoke dutch from the beginning, but he never cared to enclose this information. however, i did check the menus first two pages on google translator again and did not find any information on the leftover-day. when i kept complaining he told me to stop giving him this attitude (actually quoting him here). we ended up paying 15â¬ for each of those pasta gamba leftover dishes no one told us about. i am not enclosing the waiters name here in public but if the restaurant is interested, i most definitely can. do not come here, especially when youre a tourist."
"moscow mule. 5 iced cubes in a super small glass, 1/4 of a ginger beer in it. â¬9,5 gone.  really bad."

"nice place to grab some sunshine, nice ambience, even seating inside, customer service is ok and food average. some options are good, others not so good (avoid the burger! unless you like junk food)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of childrenâs toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbqâed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
the frites were made as i watched however there was a separate charge for mayo or ketchup which is unusual.  the shrimp kroken was also locally made.  there was a bit of confusion that the pin wasnt available and cash was required.
"as its our last night here we wanted a special meal, we made a bad choice, as i have left in tears unable to eat my food and having been spoken too so rudely....the menu leads you to believe you get chips and salad with all main meals....as they brought out one portion between 4 of us i felt it was ok to go and ask where the others were to be informed that was it but we could order others and being told to let her finish when i politely pointed out that it doesnt say that on the menu.... i have left my husband there with the children as i was so disgusted....what a horrid way to end such a lovely holiday....added to this my husband just paid 109 euros for a meal that only 2 of the 4 ate......by the way other staff were lovely but the rudeness of one ruined it."
"after the kids playground we took the break for small lunch. it is nice place - view to the harbor. as outside it was hot, we decided to eat inside. it took some time to find from the something to everybody. menu did not impress. service was also not enthusiastic (but also not bad). next time rather for drinks then food."
service makes a restaurant experience and this experience was awful. awful!!! almost two hours of waiting for an incomplete order of burger and fries and waiters that just donât car 
"its good location, nice view. we went there for lunch. smoked salmon with bread was delicious. they also served iced cold beer :)"
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"de klink 2.0, it is much better than we visited last time when it was still just de klink. service was a bit slow, we went for lunch on sunday and there were two staffs. anyway, food was great. we really like chicken satÃ© and schnizel. "
we were there for snacks and drink. it was pretty busy as it was on sunday. tables on terraces were in a good location. the service was slow because there was only one staff who could take orders. the other staffs were not so helpful. we asked the differences of the menus but he could not answer and was not willing to find the answer for us. only he asked us to ask other staff. the location is good if you want to chill and if you are okay with slow service.
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."
"having visited this restaurant a dozen times since 1968 when visiting holland, our last experience for dinner was a big disappointment. people who came much later in the dining room were paying their bill while we were served our main cour "
"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. âno problem, sir. your round table is reservedâ, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: â we never book fixed tables sir, sorryâ. butâ¦.. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"
"ice cream and food are not special, and service it is just terrible. went for an ice-cream with my little one and husband and we wanted to stay longer to have a coffee and something to eat, so i requested a table but the waiter saw us with an ice-cream and told us no, and he pointed out outside saying that the sits for people who buy ice-cream are outside not inside the restaurant. we just wanted a table to have lunch! should not matter if we also bought ice-cream earlier.... anyway, not the first time i experience bad service there and not the first time i hear from friends about the bad service. for sure i am not going back anymore, they just lost a client.."
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
"proper âtwentsâ hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs itâs a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70âs feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still donât understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "
"perfect place voor eating in town at affordable prices after you have done your shopping. in summer outside on its terrace . meal quality is good on average, but do not expect high cuisine. very friendly staff."
"the most slowly serving in my life. felt like i turned one more year. we ordered 8 small bitterballen and waited 45+ minutes. stuff served everyone in restaurant except us. i literally saw 15+ burgers (would be enough for a whole caw), desserts, drinks and also meat balls. iâm sure they just forgot about us and didnât even say sorry. i just canceled our order and said iâm not gonna pay for the food i canât eat. some girl next to us asked if we want her french fry  "
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
whilst the food we had was ok it was not the best value for money. what i found very annoying was we ordered drinks and asked for tap water as well (it was 36 degrees and we had been cycling all day). i cancelled my drinks order in order to be able to have water! other restaurants happy to give a jug of water in this situation.
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"some teenagers wanted to take-out fries on a sunny sunday, but were told that no takeaway allowed on busy days. they had to order while sitting on the terrace, but no ordinary fries available on the menu. they were forced to choose the fries with a small spare rib, priced at eur  "
the food are very nice but it took 1.5 hour for pur food to come. we have to ask for 3 times and the last one i have to say if the food still not come then we will leave immediatel 
"we chose this restaurant to host a catch up with a group of friends. it was a great location as the restaurant terrace is right on the edge of the beach and there is a playground just in front of it which was ideal for all of the kids. we booked a table from 11-5pm, with the plan that our friends would come and go at various times during the day and we would order food as required. when we first arrived, the staff were friendly enough and checked that we were happy with the table they had arranged. our initial orders were fine, but as the afternoon progressed, the service got slower and slower. this was despite the fact that it wasnt all that busy. we had one vegetarian with us, so we asked for a dish to have the meat removed from it, however when it arrived, the meat was included. on top of that we ordered a couple of things that never came yet they still ended up on the bill. we had one couple arrive at around 2pm and when we went to order extra food we were told that the kitchen was closed. when we pointed out that we had specifically booked the table with the understanding that we would order food throughout the afternoon, the staff advised that they could prepare a limited set of items from the menu. the food eventually came and the bill was amended, but we would have enjoyed our afternoon a lot more without the irritation of the poor service."
"first time in holland, popped in for dinner. waited over 20mins for a bottle of beer to arrive, which after a hot day on the water was not what id hoped for. wasnt able to accept either credit or debit cards either, so lucky my dutch friend, had enough cash to pay for  "
"went for dinner here on a special deal, for which we got the special menu; choices were varied enough, but no drinks prices were mentioned (i so dislike that oversigh "
used to visit on a regular basis because dh loved their gyros dish and i liked their lamb chops. i understand their is a new owner and we were not impressed on our last visit. the gyros was bland without the usual spicy garlic flavour he is used to and their lamb chops were no longer accompanied by a thyme flavored sauce but with a brown sauce with a definate maggi flavouring not an improvement at a 
booked for five and no table available when we arrived. table for four was made to fit five food not great but acceptable staff not attentive and one member of staff was very rude to one of our party. avoid is my advice
"i would give this place 5 stars for location, presentation and service. the food however was a let down in my opinion. located just across the old harbour with free parking opposite it and fairly easy access, limani is set in a prime location. the waiters were professional and went the extra mile to cater to our dietary requirements. unfortunately the food was hit and miss. the salmon was great and the salad bar had a reasonable selection. the grilled chicken however tasted like it had served time in the freezer and the rice like it had just come out of an uncle bens bag. it might have just been an unlucky choice for us but im not sure id come back again. "
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
i have visited here quite a few times as i stay regularly at the citta romana resort in which the restaurant is situated. most occasions the service is quite slow but normally friendly staff. the menu is basic with pizza burgers chicken ribs and fish so dont expect fine dining. the food is always hot and the servings are not to bad in size and i do recommend the burger. its nice to sit outside on a summers evening but be aware that at certain times of the year there may be a lot of oil and gas workers there as the site is poplar with working nearby. i come here when i cant be bothered to cook for myself and ive never come away feeling disappointed.
food was very nice. service was slow. only managed to get one drink with our meals.  4 starters 4 mains 4 drinks 10% discount. 80 euros. not bad.  would go back. prawn cocktail is brown shrimps. tappas was really good. half chicken just that.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
today our friends booked a table in this restaurant. we had a set menu with five dish 
we had two days a dinner; not outstanding. but very friendly and helpful staff. one could dine Ã  la carte and also make use of a bbq-buffet.
took a break in this beach restaurant whilst walking on the beac 
we stopped late afternoon for a cup of coffee. unfortunately a very loud woman disturbed us and the other customers.
after waiting for 20+ minutes on just one drink before anyone cared to take our order. then we waited for 50 more minutes only to find out that they had completely forgotten about us. as you can imagine i do not advice going there if you actually want to eat. 
i had the pizza marinara and it was ok but relied too heavily on tinned fish. the vegetable lasagne was better. the service was not very good; there being one person other than the cook doing everything. and he struggled. it was a cold wet monday when we visited so i expect they were not anticipating the ten customers there.
"firstly the staff were very nice, however as a treat i decided to order the black angus steak at nearly 26 euros. however when it arrived it looked way too big for a fillet steak and i couldnt cut into it.....after a bit of sawing i managed to get inside and it was completely raw.....i had ordered medium. i tried chewing a piece that i managed to cut off and it went round and round in my mouth....i couldnt chew it.....so when the waitor came over he took it back to the kitchen.......then about 5 minutes later out it came again.........not sure what the difference was as again i had real difficulty in cutting it...yet again when i managed to saw off a piece it was completely raw inside..what we in britain call blue ? the waiter said that that was how they like it in the netherlands, (so why call it the british pub and why ask patrons how they would like it cooked i wonder)?? he took it away and offered a free coffee...........i said no thanks. anyway we went to pay and they had still charged for that inedible chunk of meat?... the location was great but the food was inedible and the staff, although nice, a bit useless in this situation.....an expensive mistake."
"our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, the place was comfortable but the food was very average - i ordered a stuffed pepper which was pretty much a warm, but raw pepper with a bit of veg inside and cheese melted on top."
the staff was very kind. wine was very nice. food didnât seem to be homemade. tomato soup was very sweet.  we will give it another try though.
"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
"lunch was good, just 2 kroketten with cryspy bread which was good. the cola (it was pepsi, so thats bad enough already) had no sparkly taste, awfull to drink it that way! its a tourist place so people will stop by anyway."
this bar/restaurant has a great spot on the canal but everything else was average.  i wouldnt eat there again.
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often thereâs more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guestâs conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."
"on sat, 13 oct 2018, i tried my luck to go this restaurant without reservati "
good location and awesome entry create great expectations - fair enou 
"for a michelin 1 star restaurant one expects a better service, personal attention, more perfection and higher quality. the staffs are hautain and dont star in friendliness. our impression: arrogance and overdo "
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91â¬ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."
"ate here when staying at hotel montfoort, which is 20 meters aw "
"had a very nice dinner with friend from hendrik-ido-ambacht. our reservations didnt work. we ended up having to wait 15 min. to be seated. the service was good once we did get seated. the food was middle of the road. i had beef steak. the poor old milk cow that gave her life ended up on my plate, good taste but very tuff and chewy. my wife have vegetarian plate that her just love. our friend had rabbit that look good too.

food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.
"lovely place, great view. need some improvement on the fo "
"the service has been very slow! seems like this place is understaffed, especially in the kitchen. it took the waitressing staff ages taking our order and then bringing the food. my cousins bitterballen were more empty than full and it took an age for her dessert to arrive. it did appear like theyve forgotten to bring it, despite having ordered soon after ordering the tea and cof "
"for lunch its extremely busy, which is good. my omelette was excellent but my wifes tomato soup was from the ah can or alike, which is not what you expect. service is good and fast. prices are very reasonable"
"as well as the service is ok, the menu is very basic and the cooking is medium. there is an opportunity to enjoy a buffet restaurant, the time-frame is rather too short if you are not advised to get in as they start the time-fra "
"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"
we did brunch before at several van der valk restaurant in the netherlands. we are familiar about the concep 
i eat same times for work in this restaura 
"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "
"with 2 friends (total a party of 4) and a bill of 180 for a small piece of meat for me, a large piece of salmon and 2 plates of pasta. the potatoes were old and the sauces were so, so. the waiter was friendly but his co-worker (a young lady of about 25) was very insecure. no typical italian atmosphere. the website looks fine, the menu looks fine, but in th real world: i am never going back to that restaurant. not worth. no value for money."
"we recently had a wine tasting in that restaurant followed by a 4-course-dinner (group of in total 4 people). the dinner was served at the first floor of the building (so not in the restaurant). we do not know if they had to bring the food from downstairs where the kitchen is located, but it took a while before food was served. the service was not good and could be better. they did not pay enough attention to the guests, probably as there were too many people and only few waiters. very often they forgot to tell us what is served on our plates. the food was good, but not special. the price for that dinner was fixed and reasonable for what we got (as we booked for wine tasting and dinner together), so we did not see the separate menues and do not know what it costs to eat a-la-carte. not sure, if we would come back to this restaurant."
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."
"sorry, but poor. rooms are not well insulated, hear everythi "
"the foods when it arrived was not as we requested with the meat medium/rare but more than well done and dry. whilst it started raining and we sat outside, they were shutting down most umbrellas(also ours while not yet finished eating), but left others open were families were having dinner. a bit wei "
"n52Â°5717.3 e7Â°818.6 part of the camping site âde bronzen eikâ, the restaurant looks authentic inside. you can drink and eat in the cafÃ© or in the more quiet side rooms. the german weiÃen beer is available from the beer tap. we enjoyed it very much in april 2012. the restaurant food was a completely different story. the waitresses, who serve you drinks, disappear in the kitchen behind the bar, to prepare your food because there is no chef working in the kitchen. to make the combination of serving drinks and cooking feasible, the part-time cooking is done with microwave and fryer. between serving customers behind the bar, frozen food from the freezer is put in the microwave or fryer. unaware of this practise, we ordered local stew pot and fried sole. the local stew pot was canned food from the wholesale. the fried sole lived to long in the freezer. nothing fresh, nothing tasteful. just examples of inferior pub food. very disappointing. only the drinks were worthwhile visiting this cafÃ©/restaurant."
we have to wait for a few hours in heerenberg so we took this cozy place for a coffee and cake. good place to sit back and relax.
"in a quiet town, main street, this restaurant/bar is situated. you can have a good drink and a (menu based) meal downstairs. and up stairs they have a all you can eat tapas concept. the place is modern and nicely decoreted (fairly new on the inside). they have a nice glass fence-like area where you can look down into the cafÃ©. they have a bar upstairs but the food comes from the kitchen downstairs. the food is good, portion size quite decent and it tastes well. it is above average compared to other concepts. staff serving was fairly young and unexperienced but they did their best."
dark restaurant. bad light.  we had lunch but it wasnt that much.. the staff looks like they wanted to get you leave asap.
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"so you have done a reservation with this restaurant, but arriving at the place results in a closed door. not even a reaction to the reservator. restaurant is not closed or whatsoever.   advise: dont go there."
"we arrived, tired and hungry, an hour before they closed for the day at 5pm and ordered from the menu we were given - we hadnt had lunch. the waitress returned a few minutes later to say the kitchen had already closed and couldnt produce the burgers wed ordered. (why didnt she know that before?) she suggested ordering again and shed see what they could do, but it soon became obvious that everything was off except chips and chicken nuggets, not even a sandwich could be provided. so we ate chicken nuggets (a first for both of us) and watched those around us having similar conversations with the waitress and being served chips to go with their beers. a shame, because the outdoor tables are a lovely place to sit in the afternoon sun with a view of the fort."
"nice location, easy to reach from the highway a27, enough free parking plac "
"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 â¬. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.
"this restaurant is really unreliable. ive had some very enjoyable evenings there and also some forgetable ones. in august this year i had dinner there, excellent crab starter and mussels to follow. good service and a thoroughly enjoyable evenin "
"reasonable for type of facility. buffet breakfast pricey but good. dinner, reasonable for this type of hotel. room up to date and clean. location is convenient"
"we were wanting a reasonable substantial early evening meal and choose this brasserie close to the brand brewery. i selected the uitsmijter with ham and cheese at â¬7.50 and my wife the toasted focaccia at â¬5.75 also with ham and cheese. our friends choose the prawn pasta and the uitsmijter with courgette, mushroom and speck at similar prices. unexpectedly, the focaccia also came with salad accompaniment and chips and the uitsmijters also had salad accompaniments. all good food and sufficient for our appetites although the toasted focaccia was larger than needed to feel reple "
"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but iâm a little disappointed by the service."
the local soup (limburgse mosterd soup) was delicious. the french fries very good. the rest of the meal (meat and fish) good but not memorable.
"friendly staff, food was good perhaps slightly expensive for what they offered.  interior a bit dated."
"very poor service, poor quality food, badly presented. busy road running by the terrace, very annoying. not worth the bother!"
"nice setting, substandard service.  coffey  and pancake not brought at the same time. voll au vent made from frozen chicken strips"
today had a poor lunch experience in our witte 
nothing special reasonable choices but high prices. no direct competition. vieuws ok but noisy moters and cars
"not impressed, vol au vent made with chickenstrips from the makro, side salades clearly bought readymade. french fries looked nice but hard  inside. no toilets for handicapped ."
5 of us had lunch here while waiting for a car repair. all had different things and all were poor. decor was stuck in the 70s and service was minimal.

"today i came to the restaurant at 12:15. the entrance was closed off with a fence and they forgot to move it apart. i waved at three servers that were not doing anything. they noticed me at the door, but not one of them moved to talk to me. when i biked around the place two times (i thought it was my fault), they figured out how to open the entrance fence. ok, i sit down, extremely nasty and rood service. no hello or anythi "
"terrible, they gave me a beet burger, it was a little piece of beet, nothing more. cost me 16 euros. never again."
"first weve waited forever to order, then our drinks took very long to come and finally half an hour and no one came for the check even thou we asked 2 times...."
"the place has attractive, casual vibe but the first thing you will notice is the gray smoke from the kitchen. the only smoke-free room was very co "
you have to walk a bit to reach the brewery. the service and food were good. they have many different types of beers.
"we come from the northeastern us and this feels like a very northeasternly kind of place - from the atmosphere to the pricy pub menu and craft beer selection. the menu is more limited if going after 5 p.m. (as of this writing), with options for burgers, fish and chips, and similar entrees. the beet soup was delicious, as was the fish and chips. beer-lovers will find a number to choose from, with an option for flights. itâs a really beautiful walk from the train (look for the windmills by the bridge); go when the weather is nice."
when the food came it was lovely but the overall service experience detracted from this complete

"stopped off at brouwerij hoop when visiting the old dutch village of zaandijk; they offer brewery tours but we were there at the wrong time so just had a drink, or two at the bar area. several offerings from their own craft beers later we left refreshed. warm and a pleasant pit stop, but just averag "
"first of all pay attention! the atmosphere can deceive you but this place is miserable! they do not care about the customers and their orders!! ive ordered extra baked hamburgers and i get unbaked hamburger! although they saw that i could not eat, they took the hole price!"
"the chicken was still raw on the inside. the steak, even thought we said medium-well, was very bloody. the portion size of the fries was meager, to say the least. my high-light was he bitterlemon. never ever order the chai latte. and they do not listen to the complaints. i will not come here again. thank you."
"we just got ripped off 4 euros from this establishment. we ordered a mix of raw beef and cheese for 9.5 euros. then at the bill it is 13.5 euros, billing 2 individual dishes. we told her we ordered the mix and she said it is not on the menu anymore, except she gave me the menu i ordered while spelling and pointing at the mix, and she never said it was not available. avoid this place, they are not honest!"
"hubby and i stayed at an airbnb just behind this shop and popped in one morning. they didnt know the prices of a few items i asked about, which seemed weird. overall, it seemed a little bare and underwhelming with higher prices than i would have expected."
"the place is nice, but the service was horrible. the food wasnât bad, but the worst is that the people that worked there were rude and were xenophobic to us."
*food was nice and delicious but not worth the experienc 
"terrible experience in this place, the food is not great. the service is awful, they say we are not allowed to give water to our kids using ther bottles, unless you ordered from them. what closed minded owners or leadership does not want kids to drink water ? unacceptable, terrible place. do not recommend!!!"
we arrived at about 3:30pm. ordered and my gf got the wrong dish which they quickly corrected. the wait staff is not very attentive and every time we needed to order we had to call the waiter over. they do not seem very customer service oriented.
good location & be fair food is not  
"a cafe was out of cheesecake and carrotcake, ordered a waffle, but had to wait for 30 min. a menu and service could be better"
this is a restaurant for travellers who want to have proper basic food without twists. service was friendly and fast enough to be ok. food and beer was ok. ok without surprises is in my scales ok.
"between us we had a blt, burger and chicken salad, and my son had an espresso cream that he loved. not many choices in this touristy area. we rented bikes and went over the bridge to get away and found this place. did the job. note they only take cash."
"i had been in wolfsend for a lunch with my chlidren. we arrive at the same time that another family with children. we wait for half an hour for having our drinks. some other tables, that had arrived later than us, had the drinks and the food before our table and also before the other table with children. after waiting an hour, i ask the waitress for my food, she brought us a meal that we had not asked for and after rectifying, she brought our cold. they asked me to pay for the food i havenât ordered. of course, i didnât pay for i "

"we came in around 2:30 pm, the restaurant was not very full and we didnât get our food until 3:49 pm. the waitress never put in our order and forgot about it for the whole hour. a family sitting next to us came in twenty minutes after us and they received their food first, so we asked the waitress and she realized she never put it in and didnât even bother to check on us for the past hour. due to her limited english, she apologized in a very rude way. the food was okay though, but overpriced. will not recommend to anyone. "
"i wanted soup and salad and a sandwich... mustard soup tasted too heavily of mustard from the jar, maybe it should taste like that? they didnât understand simple greens for salad, but i did not want their entree salads that were the most expensive items on lunch menu. they did comply, serving me a few leaves in a bread bowl, which could not be cut or dressed with the delicious olive oil. i saved it for my sandwich "
"it was a beautiful, warm day and the outdoor tables were a great place for lunch. service was acceptable--attentive at first and then less so when the place filled up. burgers were good. nothing astonishing, mid-range prices. tip: it seems no one in the netherlands accepts credit or non-nl debit cards. plan to bring cash."
poor service and no guest caring. we had to leave for a certain time and they kept made late. we are not going back.
stopped in here after being dropped off by a bus tour to visit zaanse schans. we got soup (pretty sure the spinach soup had a chicken stock base so be careful vegetarians) and a sandwich. it was nice to get warm and out of the wind and rain but the food was average and the service the same.
dreadful experience at this restaurant where they refused to serve us for turning up 10 minutes late!!! the chef was shockingly rude and we will never return.
"the staff was friendly, and we ordered the menu with an ok price, the rest of the menu was quite expensive and we were surprised on how big the dishes were but how incredibly small portions were. the food was great quality but i would have needed 3 menues to fulfill my stomach and im a slim person that doesnt eat too muc "

we entered with kids to eat a muffin and drink a hot chocolate. waiter didnt want us to seat to eat a muffin. if you want to eat you have to take away...  bakery next door was good...
we had lovely evening here with our family.we did find menu bit limited and most of us ended having burgers as not too much to choose from.friendly staff and very helpful.children enjoyed a swim in lake and play area popular.outside heaters on for diners wishing to eat outside.
"a nicely located restaurant where they serve a nice meal! went there recently and enjoyed the food and drinks we were served, however the service was mediocre. friendly, but not very professional. long waits, not addressing our wishes in regards to what was served when. apparently they understood this themselves as well as we were offered coffee on the house at the end of the evening to compensate this lack of attention."
"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "
didnt get offered the menu that others seemed to have (eggs bacon). waited half hour for luke warm soup . nice enough staff. but very dated menu
"after a ceremony at the nearby war cemetery our party of eleven descended on the schoonoord. fortunately i had made a reservation as our visit coincided with the annual remembrance celebrations for the battle of arnhem, & the schoonoord seems to be a popular haunt for participants & visitors in this respect. consequently the place was extremely busy & the staff stretched in dealing with the substantial number of guests. service was slow & a bit random, & it took a long time to get the bill. as for the food, it was affordable âpubâ food, nothing to rewrite home about. the wok dish seemed to be appreciated by those of our party who had it, but the deconstructed ribs were so-so. verdict; overall, pretty unremarkable. "

"after waiting for 20 minutes, and no one of the waiters showing up, we left for another place to have lunch."
"firstly, the food when it actually arrived was quite good, but having waited 30 minutes for a drink, then a further 50 mins (80 in total) for a cheese banquette, im less than impressed. the waitresses were friendly and polite, but this is the third time ive eaten here and my experience is always the same "

"early evening snack meal. ease of parking. service average, however, food of good standard. met our expectations for a casual meal."
"the food was plentiful but ordinary. we are of dutch descent and i speak dutch quite well and had no problem making myself understood. the female server was aware we are canadian and she spoke good english so we had no problem understanding each other. she took care of the drinks. a young male server gave us a menu. we spoke in dutch. he left and went behind the counter and laughed and make fun of us. when he returned with our meal and later asked us if everything was to our liking he deliberately spoke dutch as fast as possible which was difficult to understand. we replied by saying pardon in english and he then spoke in english, slowly. im giving an average rating for service - the young woman was fine but the service rating for the young man is poor. that young man needs an attitude adjustment! if you cannot be respectful towards tourists who are doing their best with your language then you should not be working in the service industry."
was part of a tour group of 30 that had pre-booked lunch last sunday. we arrived 20 mins late due to road closures for arnhem commemoration to find no table available and worse no food - despite the fact that we had pre-ordered baguettes the day before! appalling service and no apology from staff member who couldnt care less and shrugged her shoulders! so much for dutch hospitality. avoid this place.

"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this âbrasserieâ is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."

"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"the restaurant is located within a short walk from the airborne museum, and we had lunch here after our museum vis "
the best thing about this restaurant is that it is just next door to the airborne museum. it is in the midst of a parking lot and hence very well positioned. we went there in lunch time and placed an order but our order was forgotten by the service staff. since we were getting delayed we had to be satisfied with a cup of coffee. the restaurant was elegant and staff were courteous but we were out of luck! we had to rush to giethoorn and hence left.
"this restaurant is located in a building next to the villa with the same name, housing the airborne museum. flowers everywhere told the story of the new management, since january 1st. service was a bit chaotic and the seating somewhat cramped, but the lunch menu offered a selection of simple but tasty food. i selected the bread with smoked salmon and a draft swinckels beer. the beer was cold and the salmon plate was prepared with due care. the test of careful preparation lies in the state of the capers on the smoked salmon. here the chef had rinsed and dried the capers, removing the awful brine taste. a good score for the food. but when i add the service, seating and price level i arrive at a three point rating."
"weâve visited the restaurant and enjoyed our 3 course dishes. when we compare the quality / price, the price is to high for the quality of the food. food was good."
i was very hungry after leaving the museum and convenience was high on my priority list. the selection here is pretty limited. i had croquettes and lobster soup. inexplicably the lobster soup had shrimp in it but the broth did taste of lobster. the 2 croquettes were huge. it was all fine but not outstanding and not really cheap. it served my purpose but i would look elsewhere if i had some time. 
been there for lunch with whole family. for kids not interesting menu and for adults the salads are different and worthy to try. the rest is normal dutch boring lunch food. nice place though and super good service. an average to good mark.
"been here twice, forgot the first time -- that is typical for the place "
"like the title says, cosy and nice but the food was a bit disappointing. did not reply to what the titles suggested. was ok but not challenging."
this place has a nice outdoor seating and it is nicely maintained. drinks and snacks arw quite good though a bit expensive. but is doea have a nice view and a history.

during our recent visit to airborne museum me and my wife decided to have diner at this place. unfortunately after 50 min of waiting for a steak (medium rear) and home made burger we were served with something that looked like a steak but tasted like grilled rubber. i suspect they grilled frozen chunk of meat and warmed it in a microwave. i refused to eat it. we shared my wife home made burger. i do not want to advertise mac donalds but for its taste and look and price they are much better not mention the price.to our surprise when it came to pay the bill they tried to charge for that rubber that is listed in they menu as beef fillet. keep away!

"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at â¬19 each! we couldnât finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to â¬46! i canât help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. thereâs many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
the restaurant looks cosy but sitting downstairs in the aterlier is different. good portion for lunch and it is delicious. service is a bit slow.
"bakery schuld originates from de town oldebroek, (producing the local cake klinkertjes) but has also a branch in elburg, comprising of a historic windmill in working order and associated buildings, where a bakery, a bakery shop and a cafe are situated. a target for a very interesting visit. ample free parking is offered around the complex. we visited to buy several packages of klinkertjes, but when we were paying at the cashiers counter, a member of the staff, probably not in the customer-comes-first mode, put a heavy box on some of our purchases. we had to get fresh packages from the shop to replace the flattened cakes. room for improvement in the customer service department."
we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef iâve had in the years iâve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit âquasi-ruralâ venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the â¬25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. iâll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i donât ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldnât make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesnât agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i donât wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."
this restaurant has wonderful ambience; shabby chic decor with wonderful holiday decor. definitely unique in the netherlan 
"its a great location and looks really trendy, but there was such poor service. the waitress walked passed us 7 times ignoring us when we wanted to order food. had to get the attention of another waitress instea "
good food and a very nice looking bistr 
"had dinner here with my girlfriend. the bistro is small and friendly, but we did not really enjoy the food very much. it was ok, but not what we had expected. the service was good and friendly though. dont think i will be back here again. "
"service in this restaurant is extremely bad, after 20 mins no one came to take our order. surprisingly they have 4 waitresses with such service. finally one came after we waved for her. my husband ordered melted goat cheese, that must be a piece of bad cheese. it tasted moldy. i will never go there again !!"
"its been a year since my last visit, but i still dont know what to think of this restaurant. it offers a nice sit-down in the outdoor seating area at the main pedestrianised street of the fortified historic center of elburg, where you can watch the passing tourists and they offer nice coffee and cake for the expected elevated dutch prices, but the hospitality still needs a brush-up as i mentioned in my last review, to prevent the restaurant to descend into the category tourist trap. an example: we were with three and due to the position of chairs and tables against the restaurant front, and space only for two at a table, i occupied a separate table. these tables were very close to each other, mind. when i finished my coffee and cake, the waitress cleared my table immediately and inquired, if i desired another drink or the bill. this while my family at the next table hadnt finished there cake yet. talking about throughput in a restaurant. by the way, only half of the tables where occupied. no, i didnt feel welcome and a three point rating, mostly given because the nice spot in elburg, is the best i can do."
"not good, also not very bad. just nothing really stands out here and thatâs too bad as the place seems to have all to make it good cosy and upscale place."
what a shame! good food wasted by terrible service. we had booked a table for 6.30 and arrived to be told that the table was not available yet and to go and sit at the bar (no complimentary drink) at 6.50 we were offered a table in their party room which was totally unatmospheric. at 7-15 we were offered an acceptable table. we received no apologies at all. the food was in fact really good but what a shame about the standard of service!!!
the go 
"the terrace is nice, but service absolutely not good: questions about menu were unanswered, made us feel unimportant , food was not as to be expected in relation to price ( dinner) , side dishes seemed very leftover and warmed up. spinach was potatoepuree with few leaves of spinach?, i would not recommend this restaurant ."
"we ordered salmon with fries, it came without fries, the fries arrived when my daughter had finished. my son ordered tenderloin stake, they forgot to bring it, the order arrived when everyone else had finished and it was a plate of little pieces of meat, on top of a lot of salad. i ordered a grilled goat cheese salad, what arrived is regular goat cheese on top of salad, without salad dressing and they said they had no vinegar. my fatherâs shrimp salad and carpaccio were the only correct dishes. they kept on sending new waiters, who did not know how to react. beautiful town, surely there must be better restaurants around here."
"mediocre food, sloppy service and the ambiance of a buffet-restaurant in a railway station. to be avoided."
"reading previous reviews is unfortunate.  we only came for drinks and snacks and were welcomed and received very nicely. good hospitality,nice beer and good service. cant say otherwise.  try for yourself and make your own judgement."
"went here without a reservation around 20:30 on a saturday evening. we asked for a table for dinner, but inside was fully packed. we were seated outside. the waiter came 1 min. later to tell us there was a table available. this table was a big one for 8/10 pax, but next to the toilets. a big downside were the aggressive flies around our food and drink "
"stopped here for coffee and cake as views were the best in town.  service was a bit lacking, otherwise a decent vist"
"awful experience: 15 minutes before receiving the menu, 1 hour before receiving the first ordered dish, 1 hour and half before receiving the second dish. all of the other customer have been served except us. we have asked for an explaination but the excuse was the kitchen is very busy, despite all the customer were serv "
"the restaurant is located just outside the city centre with a nice view from the terrace over the harbour. the restaurant is dark and the food is ok, but not special."
lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
"restaurant de tijd is located in rijsbergen at the old road from breda to antwerp. the restaurant has an unassuming dining room, a large room for private partying and a terrace overlooking the road that was build in 1812 under napoleon ru "
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
"perfect if you are into toddlers and like quirky austrian dresses on dutch waitresses. loud, unorganized and near average food. good beers. people changing diapers on the next table. parents running after their offspring. dont get me wrong, its crowded on a sunny day. has a playground. mass cant be wrong. just not for me. "
"dinner here with colleagues. solid food, excellent dessert, good, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. difficulty using credit card to pay."
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"nice location, but a nothing special type of ambiance and service. food is cheap and ok, but again nothing special. really a shame because this location on the dobbe plas could be a lot better and special"
we went there with some friends in ju 
this restaurant has been in nootdorp for quite some years. to date we never heard from anybody in the village that actually dined there. so we went ahead and had a g 
the staff (especialy the owners) are not really on the friendly side. waiters took a long time the present menus. then it took also a long time to ask for a drink. in my opinion this can be done or asked when presenting the me 
fast food kind of food. kebap with a style. still kebap. it is not bad. but it is not superb. lots of food fast served. baklava is expensive and not finest.
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulÃ©e, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "
limited menu.  pancakes were the specialty and these were done well.  other items were average.  menu is not in english.
the lunchroom of the huisje van de zeeuw is run by the krimpenerwaard day spending foundation. it provides extra structure to the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by offering daytime activities. this is in line with the perception and ambitions of each individual participant. we enjoyed a good lunch.

"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little cafÃ©. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"went for a sunday afternoon drink in this place. we had a good hour out, i would recommend the chicken bites they taste very good. staff is very friendly and takes good time. the coffee is good. it is not too busy. due to the nice weather we sat outdoor."
"atmosphere ok, food average (minimal for the price). we tried it and will not go again as others are way better price wise."
"when you choose to travel by car for a visit to tapas restaurant olijf, the multilevel car park boekenberg is especially suited for the purpose. the pedestrian way-out drops you right behind the restaurant and the parking fee is moderate. the web site of olijf contains this excellent advice. the restaurant is located in a historic building in the voorstraat, one of the streets that are left over from the old village spijkenisse. the atmosphere of the restaurant can be soothing, except that there were somewhat more flies in residence than you could wish in a restaurant with an open kitchen. later on the evening one fly decided to have a bath in my wine glass. brrr... furthermore, the somewhat irritating music over the speaker system clashed with the restaurant appointments. it is my opinion that music in shops or restaurants is mostly there for the pleasure of the staff, not for the customer. service of the staff was friendly, but mechanically. the dutch are not very good in hospitality and serving customers, not like italy, where hospitality and serving customers is an art. furthermore, our waitress omitted to bring clean plates for the main course; a grave mistake. it was also difficult to attract the attention of the staff. in the end it was impossible to get our bill presented to the table, so we decided to take our coats and ask for the bill at the counter. but how was the food then? olijf is a tapas restaurant, where you share with your table companion divers small portions, ordered from the menu. generally, the food was well prepared. sauces are to be avoided, they come out of a bottle. i must say the slices egg pancake with salmon and cream cheese filling were delicious and also the pork medallions with bacon wrapping were cooked perfectly. however, later on my digestion system told me that possibly the chef of olijf uses flavour enhancers in the preparation of the food. maybe salt msg. (also called ve-tsin in chinese restaurants). i may be wrong, but i am very sensitive for this additive. what shall i say about olijf. it can be a very nice restaurant when some easy improvements are made by the management. but they do something right. the restaurant was busy on this weekday and mostly with regular customers."
it is a good place with a fairly tasty food. tried tapas and it was fine. i didnt pay so i dont know the average per person. portions are not big so heavy eaters need to watch out.
"maybe they had an off day, but the last time we were here for a tapas surprise menu, the fish was tough and the meat was cold. and as it was not that crowded, it was strange that it took far to long to serve the fo "
"what a surprise to find in a small village in rotterdam area a tapas restaurant, very nice place and very nc tapas, too."
we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"
"staying in the (slightly isolated) hotel this was the choice for dinner, and a good option to "
"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant
"recently we visited the restaurant, and there was no table available in a light area. we asked for a table near the window, however most tables were occupied by flexworkers who installed their laptop or backpacks and were nowhere to be seen. the manager, when asked replied that it was no problem to them because they welcome everyon "
"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crÃ¨me brulÃ©e with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"
the goo 
30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"we had a family lunch at palkinto, really nice place, the food was simple but okay. chill environment."
"we were looking forward for a nice evening and were excited to dine in this high ranked restaurant. when we got there, we were greeted without any kindness, rather as if we were not welcome. when we were seated we got a little amus-bouche which waa very good, but we had to wait for the menu for at least 10 minutes and ask 3 times for a bottle of water. in my opinion, for a restaurant in this category, absolutely unacceptable. the lady that served the bread, which came in three different types, wasnât really able to explain the difference and seemed more annoyed than willing to do her job or at least be friendly. i decided to go with the 4 course menu, the first course was lobster and mackerel which was good, but already a little disappointing, as the portion was really small and the sauce was too sour and i missed the light sweetness of the lobster, what makes it so special. the white wine we ordered, a light summer wine, had room temperature and just put on a small table next to us, so that we had to ask the service (several times) to put it in the refrigerator again. the quality of the food decreased from course to course, just like the serviceâs motivation to make an effort for us to have a pleasant evening. we then decided to forgo the desert and just stop this nonsense. the whole evening was a pure disappointment and absolutely not worth the money we spent there!! "
the food and the service are really good. but: when i left the restaurant i was still hungry and so was my (female) colleague. from a three course meal of round about 50 euros i think i can at least expect not to be hungry anymore.
"this was our third trip to villa la ruche. pleasant atmosphere and friendly, efficient service but the food was rather disappointing as was the case during our second visit last year. we ordered a 5 course surpise menu this time. the third dish with sweetbread and biff was very tasty and very appealing. the remaining dishes lacked character and taste. in addition, the lobster served in the second dish was partially raw. i doubt very much we will be going back."
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone. "

"nice and friendly reception, the starters were good and promising. unfortunately, the mains were disappointing. it was obviously not the best day for the cook. however, service was good."
"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p. 
nice restaurant and clean.  good for lunch.  food and drinks reasonable price and service ok.  pasta with prawns and chicken sate are good.
"the interior is looking well taken care of, the service was a bit slow. that was strange because there were enough waitresses walking aroun "
this place needs new management. food and coffee (illyð) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.
we visited here on our trip for a quick lunch near the city where our friends were marri 
the friendly hipster staff makes up for the minimalistic non-hipster motif and a few regulars who treat it like their own truck driver pit stop. the quality of their products including their pastry seems out of place considering there is not much competition or a discerning public but their efforts should be rewarded by a visit while passing through or instead of sitting indoors for coffee chats. a few neighborhood fans certainly dont want to see this coffee corner go even if it doesnt exactly fit the neighbourhood picture. i agree. the sleepy town needs some pepping up!
it was a busy friday evening and the two girls working front of house were very busy. the service was therefore very slow but very friendly.  the food was good but they needed more staff.
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasnât a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anywayâ¦ waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"we booked a dinner with my husband and my son, sold as live cooking buffet... its just another of those all you can way place with a very large variety of food where you can eat everything but the quality isnt for sure something remarkable."

"the lunch menu was a bit boring. i had a beef carpaccio, which was reasonably executed, but the portion of bread was very small. service was ok, but a bit slow seeing at they seemed to have 6 serving staff. i wouldnt go again as there are better options in the area."
the drink arrived when we had already finished the appetizers and i had to ask for the napkins twice after the first course. fairly good dishes but with definitely not involving combinatio 
"evening meal with colleagues, menu choice is limited and service is ok but not quick..... you have to make sure that you grab the attention of the waiter otherwise you will sit there all evening being ignored potentially. food quality is good...."
"if you came here as part of a keukenhof coach tour or wedding festivity, both happening during our meal you probable be quite happy but we came to meet with family to chat and relax. both food and wine menu ok. i had carpaccio to start, dutch lamb with white asparagus (in season) for mains and good selection of cheese for desert. considering price level service was patchy and not out waitresses fault just overloaded - 3 requests for wine list and having to wait for water glasses to return from washer before we could have some. nothing especially local about the experience. "
"resto is located in the same building and complex as the senior citizens home.  it is rather. interior is spacious and decor is just right. food was fine and done well, although nothing that stands out. service was also fine."
"this is a very nice restaurant in many respects. the interior is very nice and excellent service. i think the chef also really knows how to cook as shown by the good taste of several of the dishes, with special compliments for the french fries. however, some serious problems need to be fixed. an almost complete lack of healthy vegetables is nowadays hardly acceptable anymore. furthermore, all dishes were far too high on calories, e.g. the pumpkin soup, and especially the dessert was completely over the top with too much cookies and other stuffing ingredients. so if they adapt to modern times and give much more attention to healthy ingredients, that by the way most often can also taste great, this restaurant has a great future.

"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesnât seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. weâll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chefâs cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be â¬2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
"excellent food, could not fault it for freshness and tast "
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"the staff are really not caring or professional here most of the time. the food is not the best but its ok (average), if the staff had a better attitude and where professional this would not be such a bad place to eat but with bad service and average food. we have tried this place a few times and every time we think why did we do it. its a hit and miss. and we go expecting the hit only to miss most of the time. would not recommend."
"not satisfying at all, staff was not really caring (students having a job, but absent), food was ok but too much and not really 4star level, for a top3 restaurant really not where it should be, will prefer other restaurant next time"
we visited this restaurant last week with 5 people (incl. our 5 year old so 
youâd think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30â¦ but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. wonât be coming back for breakfast thatâs for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"good food, nice people, but no respect for any covid-19 measure. no 1.5m distance between tables, no masks, no qr  check, nothing. a true insult to the public and other restaurants who do respect the guidelines."
"my family-in-law goes here all the time apparently. they are not foodies. the decor of this restaurant looks beautiful. but its kind of restaurant with an identity crisis. is it italian, or greek? cause they are known to be italian (in my family-in-law at least), but really the menu is greek, with also one dish of risotto (which then makes it italian-greek?). food is a lot and greasy. not very satisfying. i liked the tzatiki and pita bread, but thats really all i liked. "
nothing to get excited about. pretty good quality mediterranean meals. the staff are very friendly and welcoming.
"we went out for a family dinner to this restaurant. while the welcome was very friendly and warm and the staff and the manager very friendly we were disappointed in the delays in serving our food. the presentation of the food was super but it took way too long for our food to be served and when it finally did get served it was almost cold. that spoilt everything! my husband expressed his disappointments directly to the manager so we hope that the next time we go there, if we do, the serving of the food is well improved!"
we went to plein 22 for a quick dinner on a friday nig 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we enjoyed a great get together here, where the facility was perfect, the coffee was plentiful and the baked treats were beautiful. plenty of outdoor seating as well from full sun to pleasant shade. why 2 stars? i pre ordered a vegan lunch and it was just laughably bad. it consisted of two bare rice cakes, half of a sliced tomato and a few bits of sliced cucumber. it was probably 100 calories of tasteless bits of food. they made absolutely no effort to make something decent. its as if no one has a phone with google."
"the rib eye was tough and cold, vegetables were scarce and not tasty.when we said that the meat was tough, they did nothing. people must know how this restaurant has deteriorated because there was hardly anybody dining, only a few having snacks in the terrace. it is a shame that they do not serve good meat but maybe trying to get rid of whatever they had."
"young couples, friends, families, everybody feels at home here. the staff is friendly and laid back."
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10â¬ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"what can i say. unpleasant staff you have to call by ringing a bell (inside) as there is no service. a double espresso? two shots of powdered coffee i wouldnt give pigs price euro 4,60!!!!!! its that i had to wait for someone but this is a tourist trap stuck in the 70s apart for the pricing. no wonder it is so empty. if i was the owner i would upgrade or enjoy my pension"
we vist the pyramide van austerlitz on a regular basis. we always begin with one of the walking routes in the woods and round the pyramid then we end up in the big playground with our small children. there are enough things to choose from so every child has something to keep them entertained also in the summer months they haveaarcade a sort fairground with attractions such as a train and bumper cars. the restaurant itself is very old and self service the restaurant could be improved and the toilets need to be cleaned on a more regular basis because they always stink and look really dirty.
poor and shabby place with much potential. the place is literally 100 years old. there is a pretty cool playground and arcade hall next to it. the campings are very nearby and also the pyramide. a landmark built by napoleo 
"the location is at the begin of the pyramide complex, not far from the parking place. next to the restaurant there is a big playground but its not open during the winter ti "
"bar and restaurant. i was here for lunch, and my 2 year old daughter and i were here alone for most of the time. maybe on other occasions its more lively. lunch was simple, service slow, and the setting was a bit dark for mid-day."
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (ârevenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.
chalet helenaheuvel is an ideal place to stop for drinks or lunch when exploring the beautiful kaapse bossen (forest) in the utrechtse heuvelru 
"great coffee, average soup and sandwiches. slow service on a saturday afternoon, maybe due to a party. too expensive."
"the âde oranjerieâ is located inside the park of the doorn huis, the ambience is charming and class; the service is friendly but not very quick; the dishes are well finished. very good solution for a brunch or a tea break."
"tasty food, many small dishes. the good tempranillo was a little expensive though. friendly people, service with a smile!"
you know instantaneously when youâre in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteurâs admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."
"amis restaurant is a lovely, quaint place to have dinner with business partners, friends and/or family. staf was friendly, helpful, and we had a nice ti "
i did eat here people are not caring anyone they are not working only walking they dont care for the coustemer. also food is not so good.  i never want go again
"so all in all, right to the point here, this was once upon a time a good restaurant, a great one ev "
this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the âsmellsâ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... donât go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
stale wings lukewarm burgers  lukewarm fries  its a recipe for food poisoning.  holland ruined kfc for me. its just no good!
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"went for a friday night dinner. small place with nice ambiance located in the center of veenendaal. we reserved a table (the place is not big) and ordered drinks and a three course menu. starter was tomato soup (very tasty) with smoked chicken and beer-battered fried mushrooms with walnuts and salad. starters were very good. thereafter we had chicken satay and white fish. compared to the starters these dishes were a bit of a miss. although presented very nice and good the taste was a bit bland. with a little more effort (marinating the satay meat and seasoning the fish) they could improve it. the potential is there! we ordered the creme brulee as dessert and the chefs surprise. very well portioned and tasty! all in all (for the price) we had an excellent dinner and enjoyed our stay. service was good and done by some young girls, we waited for the starter and they actually forgot us but the made the apologies and as we were not in a hurry it was all fine. so, for a good bite and reasonable price this is a good place."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so donât plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
"the food was cold and tasted like soap, server was simply rude, inside the burger the meat was still nearly frozen in the center. the fries tasted gross like someone had put a cleaning supply or soap on them absolutely awful, ate at mcdonalds many times, never again at this venue."
arrived here for lunch just to be told there is no babychair available and that the restaurant is not actually â for kid 
"a lot of rats. the food was the worst i ever tasted, everything was dirty. and on top of that the service was awful. wouldnât recommend."
words cant describe how trash the service is.  its a shame how they treat customers. if you want a horrible experience... go!
wouldnât recommend !! they have zero respect for customers. they treat people like animals and if you say something about it they donât appreciate it !! please donât waste your money and time !!
"not even worth one star! if your black do not go! they will put your food on the ground, and tell you to pick it up! and if you say something about it ,they will call the police on you! im very dissapointed ,the way they treath black people is not right!"
"didnât like my visit att all, food is trash. service not good att all. they are so mean to alot of people. so basiclly donât waist your money. itâs not worth it."
"classical dutch pub. typical brown interior. we wanted a small lunch, and that is what they are good  "
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "
had dinner here with my wife and our 2-year-old daughter. stayed in the hotel (separate review 
"this pizza restaurant that is located in the center of town close to the main shopping street, bars and cafe "
we was here at a sunday. they was about to close but we got pizzas. very friendly waiters. the bosses are good an tasty. outside sitting possible. prices are too high for pizza. from 12 euro and up.
"the entrance and inside was nice and looked great. friendly waiter. nice food but i missed my sour creme with the fijtas. other than that, it was nice."
"the restaurant looks great, its has a very nice ambiance. the waitress was really friendly but she couldnt give us any recommendation. we started with nachos with cheese and meatloaf which was very tasty. we also had carpaccio, this was okay but way to much salad... ive ordered for the main course the argentinian steak well done. it tasted okay in my opinion it was a bit boring... the fries were tasty, side dish again a bit boring... we had a good time, the terrace is nice, the staff friendly. the price is okay, but im not sure if i will go there again. "
"restaurant looked so inviting on the website, but on arrival discovered a restaurant that was hazy and smelt awful from people smoking inside. decided to find another restaurant."
we were with a large family to celebrate someones birthda 
this an average (pancake) restaurant. pancakes are fine did not try the other dishes. it has a small terrace and pleasant service. not a place to go for fine dining.
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
we dropped by for a quick bite. it is at the centrum and close to oypo museum. the staff is very friendly.
"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"lunchroom t schild is a sandwich restaurant in the city center of rijssen. the positive side of t schild is, that there is a large outside sit-down area, where you can enjoy watching the saturday afternoon life in downtown rijssen go by. the service of the waitresses was a bit bumbling and unpolished; to be encountered in the netherlands unfortunately too often. the recommended home-made walnut cake was dry and nothing special and the hot ham and cheese sandwich my companion ordered, was obviously assembled in haste without sufficient care and served without appropriate cutlery.only the prices were in the expected (high dutch) bracket. i shall avoid lunchroom t schild in the future."
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i donât know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
i paid 30â¬ for 2 pizza and after 2days still dont have food no food no money back !! guy on reception cant speak english
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"when we visit the netherlands, all our kids seem to want to do is grab something out of the febo wall. the febo wall is a wall where there are small windows where you can see snack . you pay the machine and open the window of choice and get the snack you paid for. this magical snack wall offers croquet, cheese souffle, frikandel. actually just fast food. it is fun to see how many people enter, choose, pay, grab a snack and are on their way. obviously, the food is what it is, junk food, but well.. once in a while we all indulge!"
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the tableâ¦.. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . iâve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
"this restaurant is a restaurant that has good and tasteful food, but with a little bit of high prices. the service of the staff is okÃ©, but not that special.this restaurant had a good location if you want to have a diner before going to see a movie, because its near the cinema. the choice of food is poor and i preferred some more options. i must say that what they served, tasted very nice. i chose a fish dish and it was prepared good. i enjoyed my time here and maybe i will go back again. "
this is one of these all you can eat restaurants that thrive on keeping you waiting for food - whilst serving you overpriced drinks..... euro 5.35 for a glass of wine 
"very good caprese, but not a great pizza nor atmosphere. prices are relatively high for the quality. service is friendly."
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
"our last experience was not the best, me and my partner both had the burger from the menu. i asked mine to be topped with a fried egg and that was no problem. when the two burgers arrived at the table, mine was perfect and with the egg as requested, but my partner was not satisfied since her burger was very under cooked. we mentioned this and we were told that this was no problem to eat, since it was beef from the should "
visited this place with the family . food was oke not convincing but oke. the karma shoarma (vegan) 12 euro was in my point of view way overpriced 
we had an amazing party but the toilets were ridiculous. the ladies line was so long and they werent even using all the ladies toilets. girls were crying and the security was aggressive. i watched a girl pee in her pants and try to go through and the security stopped her. never mind the fact that there were atleast 5 open womens toilets when this happen 
"worst place ever. not too mention theyâre expensive, that i can deal with. drinks in plastic glasses, fine. but having to queue 45(!) minutes to go to the ladies, thatâs just outrageous. especially as you also have to pay for this ridiculously poor service! thereâs certain standards that have to be met and propper access to toilets is one of the most important. if u cannot service your public then sell less tickets. this club tries to establish its self as upscale but in reality, itâs a dump. "
"nice for hippies our would-be amsterdam people, but nothing special. go north across the noordzee channel and you will find much nicer and authentic places..."
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"whilst the service was pleasant the food was not great. the goatâs cheese cannelloni was very heavy with thick pasta and the kale quiche was quite flavourless. my friendâs burger was also rather dry. this would have been forgivable until they allowed a couple to bring in their frankly enormous dog, which is bad practice for an eatery in my opinion. we were left unimpressed."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go.

"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. itâs at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say âignore visitingâ and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and donât bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so donât mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
"great place to be on a sunny day. very comfortable lounge furniture invites to relax when having a drink. felt very well here with my friend. unfortunately my caesar salad was absolutely disappointing, made without any touch of effort. some leaves of salad, few eggs and fried chicken. no capers, no anchovyâs and sauce without any taste.."
"arrived at 2pm waiting for 20min and asked 6 times to place my order. after i went to the bar for a 2nd time, someone found the decency to follow me to our table to take the order. 30mins passed in the meantime. another 30mins until the food came out. food was extremely disappointing and wonder why two slices of bread with salmon and the other with tuna takes 30min? the visit ended with waiting for 20min for the bill. in the meantime people around us left without paying. staff though was very friendly. i felt sorry for them. they were doing their best but they obviously have a manager who has no clue how to manage and plan for a busy summer day. i will not go again..."
"ive bough a ticket for an event at this venue. arriving at the location, the customers are confronted with a mandatory toilet charge already at the door. if you refuse to pay, they will not let you in and the money that you have paid for the event will be forfeit. never again. i am surprised people never wrote about this here."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
"attracted by the nice location we had diner. the idea, as the waiter explained, is kind of a table dhote concept with changing menus every week. the food was ok, unfortunately the service quit poor. loads of dirty glasses and dishes remained on table, water was hard to find and orders were mixed up ( there were only 4 tables to be served "
"a lovely location and a great building - an old youth hostel - has a good menu. however, the experience was tarnished by poor service; delays and wrong orders."
"we often stop here to have a drink or so. volenteers serving, many playing and shouting kids, not much choice but ok for a soup or a drink. sit if the sun is out end enjoy. but not too long, beautiful nature around the corner (if not to many bikers and runners). relax!"
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosÃ© disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didnât have to fill in our details) they didnât clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and itâs sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here ð
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the satÃ© meat was very d 
they advertise fresh farm fries. these are great and a real reason to come back as a regular. when its sunny thus busy they revert back to greasy factory fries which are not even cri 
location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
been there a few times and ordered something else every time. but sadly every dish was disappointing. it wasnt bad but it always had flaws. the location is cool. the personel is okay. sometimes they just close parts of the terrace wich is weird because itâs not nice to sit on every spot. they use way too much sauce imo.
we went there with a group od 16 people. the place was overheated and the service mediocre the food was less than mediocre.
my girlfriend and i went there for a small dinner just a sandwich or a starter we arrived at 17:00. we could only have small bites instead of something decent. crazy we had to wait for half an hour to order some decent food. we could also not have something of the lunch menu. besides it was expensive and service was poor. 
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. donât go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and itâs just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and itâs close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"great italian food. great italian atmosphere. great value for money. was very busy, but we could sit at the last unreserved table. food and drinks italian style. fast service, fast food and good prices."
"went here expecting to have a good dining experience, unfortunately the service was disappointing. the waiters were friendly and helpful, however we got the impression they couldnt cope with all the guest they were serving. we ordered some bread which they forgot and brought after our main dish had arrived, then i ordered some wine and they brought us water. regarding the quality of the food, i wasnt really impressed about it, the meat i ordered was very dry and there was an excess of sauce. definitively in my opinion this place is not worth the visit."
"on our holidaytrip, we stopped at la trattoria in castricum. sitting on a terrace, we had a nice dinner. the food was good, the service fine and the price was fair."
"we visited deining twice. last year, from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return her "
"lunch with some colleagues to discuss things in a nice location rather than a meeting room. we had a coffee outside and sandwiches inside. all good, service was friendly and efficient."
a really nice place as well as in good weather as in hard north sea conditions. beautyful fireplace and friendly service. the main dishes are not as nice as the rest and the pasta was more or less not eatable. just donât try it
"from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return here. "
"we traveled from amsterdam to castricum to visit an old friend. we stopped here for lunch after walking on the beach. we sat inside as the sun was very strong. server was not very friendly but we got our drinks and food. we had salads and they were very good. when we had asked for still water and he was quite put off about it. otherwise a good meal, not busy during the week."
we went here on a great indian summer evening for din 
"went to the beach at castricum-at-sea, had a drink and a bite at deining. average food, friendly personnel. crowded and noisy, but hey, thats what you get at an beach inn."
"been there several times, always enjoying sitting outside. beware of the wind but nice place anyway and at least as good, maybe better than surroundings. but no really oustanding things to mention."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we came here for a quick lunch and we thought â¬12 for our meatball sandwich which wasnât that tasty or special was quite expensive. the place is nice and the location is special.
"my wife and i ordered the catch of the day this was sea bass. this was two, uneven, filets of sea bass on spagetti with tomato sauce and raw bean sprouts. a fusion dish both bewildering and, frankly, disgusting. i think they should have warned us that this was a spaghetti dish. the fish was tasteless, so i gathered the tomato sauce was there to conceal this! we also ordered a side dish of roasted potatoes and salad. the salad was uninspiring and the potatoes were raw. the cost of the meal was around 70 euros and they offered a 10 euro discount. this did not take away the bad taste in our mouths!"
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the dÃ©cor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"cons: far from everything, somehow depressive. even far from everything, there is no mini bar or small refrigerator at room so you can buy something to the room. almost 0 facilities, no gym, no pool, really nothing, not even water at room. breakfast is poor and getting worst, they are reducing options even in bread. furniture and ambiance is dark. at the entrance smoker people has a comfortable sit so they pollute entering people with bad sme "
"we come to this place once in a while and must say that food quality varies: we had multiple ocassions that food was not really warm, the fries bag not fully filled or invalid orders. but if you mention it, they will quickly resolved the probl "
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
"we had a nice evening chatting, eating and drinking. however apart from the kroketten nothing outstanding, actually all the meat not cooked very well (nobody asked how we wanted it), or maybe not the best quality, and all rice served in paella etc very porridge like and overcooked, little fresh vegetables. servers all very nice, kitcen a bit sloppy as we asked for no curry sauces and still got it.... drinks quite pricy not to say expensive for such a place. even served water only by the bottle and paid (tap water would have been fine. all over spent nearly 30 euros pp on food and 10 euros on drinks which is not a little for such a place. nevertheless had a nice evening and reservations and table fine."
"with tapas i would have expected spanish food, but its a fusion of dutch, asian and italian foid in small portions. some are great, some are mediocre. environment is nice and service is quick."
"the all you can eat menu includes a lot of dishes which are all average. nothing is really good, and all the tastes used are familiar. this made it unappealing, especially when comparing the food quality with the prices. some of the staff were friendly, some not. the decoration of the restaurant is nice but the details are not (e.g. usage of a cheap bench). for this location and price, we expected way better food."
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
if you like dutch fried and deep fried snacks this is the place. but many times they got your order wrong and long waiting times. staff is not always that friendly but we keep coming back to this place.
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
"weve been to the flaming feather toverland, on october 23rd 20 "
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand cafÃ© with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
"the staff is really family oriented, efficient and very friendly. food is ok. good to reserve before going."
"for my mother in lawâs birthday, we went to porto maurizio in heythuysen. we arrived at 18:15 and got our starter around 18:45. the three of us ordered pizza (not too difficult to prepare), but it took the chefs more than one hour and 25 minutes to get out pizzaâs out on our table. the pizza tasted okay, but iâve had better at porto maurizioâs. if you ask me now, iâm in doubt if i will come and eat here again."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
"this restaurant is located at the base of the wilhelminatoren, so location is perfect if youre visiting the area. its a big restaurant with a nice terrace. the menu is typical dutch and so was the food. we ordered a salad, a croque and a stew. all were ok but not special. same for the local beer. good for lunch, but wouldnt have dinner here."
"although, in netherlands under this corona crisis, you are allowed 4 people per table and tables only had 3 chairs, we were barked at but a very rude waiter, screaming at us that things are different than in belgium... making clear his disrespect for people outside of holland! i have no issue with directions being given in this crisis, but the way we were barked at, explicitly outlining being belgian is rude, disrespectful and deserves a strong review on this for "
"for the last day of may we decided to go to the 3 country area in the south of the netherlands. this is in vaals, limburg. the navigation system guided us through the city over the four borders street towards the first stop; wilhelmina tower. the tower was built in 2011. enterance costs 3 euro per person, small children are free. you buy a token to get there in the restaurant beneath the tower. here i had a scary experience as when i wanted to pay by pin i thought i had to enter the pin code but instead the device asked for the amount to add as gratitude. luckily it did not accept my pin code as gratitude; too much it said... but why? why asking for gratitude when buying enterance token "
itâs a beautifull restaurant at a top location. the coffee is tasty but canât say the same about the food. especially the spare ribs were dreadfull. so if youâre just visiting to have a drink itâs ok but donât have dinner there.
the estate is amazing! great view but the food could be better. i had shrimps on the rock (16â¬) and wasnt satisfied with what i got. shrimps were minuscule and one could tell theyve been in the freezer before. not worth at al 
1. the theme is good but a bit over the top. way too many pictures. 2. music is not matching the theme. 3. too many flies. 4. dishes taste ok but not looking good.
this restaurant is clean and food is reasonable and price is very good.  the inside is like eating in a church on church pughs.  nice atmosphere and unusual location.  overall good.
"the restaurant located in an old missionary serves a small menu with easy going meals and easy going service. very cheap and in accordance with the meal. not too fancy, but good to go. we had the local special zuur vlees which was alright. the restaurant closes at 8 pm!!! so be in time."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
"horrible waiter , she took her time serving us and even just giving us a menu , we ordered a starter and a main course and she brought it together?? why even add a starter if u bring it together its called a starter for a reason. when we called her over she even eyerolled at us ð¬the pasta didnt have any cream and was filled with oil.. the burger was dry and bland and even the bread we ordered was bad i struggled to finish it just so i wouldnt feel like i wasted my money, worst experience ive had in vaals. i wouldnt recommend this restaura "
"a nice place to sit on the terrace, but the only table free was in the corner, so it was not practical to eat from when the main dish arrived, due to lack of space and being difficult to serve the hot dishes. hence we changed tables. took a menu, the steak was not very good, but the rest was decent. we wanted to try apfulstrudel for desert, as i saw this on the menu. but they said they had nothing but ice-cream. the desert was very simple unfortunately. i wouldnt recommend this restaurant."
"you can expect simple, but well prepared food. the prices are very agreeable. staff is very polite. the only point of attention are the flies outside on the patio."
"perfect place for a nice lunch, the staff take there time and are friendly. we enjoyed our soups of a chilly winters day. even though you sit on the heated veranda we chose to sit inside in the cafe."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the âreibekuchenâ were great. the âzuurvleesâ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
"i am handicapped and asked for a table were i am more or less protected. but this they did not have, it was busy, understandable. on my question: â if you make reservation is it than possible to have a table out of the busy part of the restaurant. the answer was no, we have no attention for this, it is better if you go to a less busy restaurant. i was flabbergasted, but thought okÃ©. good food here, but if handicapped you are not welcome here. we went to the village of vijlen where we ate in cuba libre, which was a good experience. "
"the food was terrible, heaten up in a microwave. i never have eaten such a tastless mousaka in my life. watery and the calamaris was rubbery. cheap squidrings would be better then this. only the dry white wine was good. it was packed and bums on seats policy. never go again to this  greek restaurant."
"great greek food, but very noisy and crowded with little children running and screaming. cant eat your dish calmly"
i was looking forward to a nice date evening with my husband but i didnt like the restauran 
..i suggest to avoid this place and try somethingelse in the vicinity. the food is low quality and we didnt like the service also. i will not came back for sure!
"heading for the 3landepunt and we stopped for breakfast! all is prefabricated and pretty tasteless, even if quantity is large! nice decoration on the wall as it represents old news papers about the place and history about the borders! the waitress was helpful! however i would not eat here again! "
"the food is good, nice setting but slow service, good beer.  sorry but i would not go back..i was not impressed."
this is not the drielandenpunt ... its another km onwards. tower has no arrows or anything pointing out landmarks. drinks were expensive.
"the food is absolutely terrible. pasta was supposed to be fresh but was not fresh at all, pesto out of a jar, sour salad on the side, tuna sandwich with terrible tuna out of plastic box,â¦ and pricy! way too expensive for food that is not at all fresh! 16,5 euro for âfreshâ pasta? 10 euro for a piece of bread with tuna spread?! we were with 7 persons and everybody left a plate with half eaten food. what a sad end of our family weekendâ¦"
restaurant close to the 3 country point with a great view from the terrace. we ordered salads and fried eggs for lunch; average quality against a fair price and friendly service.
"we came to this restaurant for lunch on a rainy afternoon. there is plenty of covered, as well as uncovered terrace, but we chose to sit comfortably indoors. the service was very pleasant. the menu, though not large, offered enough lunch items. they have no salads, which is unusual. we all ordered a dutch pancake, and were unfortunately very disappointed. clearly neither the apple nor the cheese pancake was made on the spot. they were tough, even hard to cut. most probably they had been rewarmed in a microwave. what a disappointment, nine euros for a tough pancake. "
"for me it was clear that this restaurant depend on tourists and not people that return. it was a close call to giving only 2stars but the trout made the difference. being a fan of liver (especially with bacon and onions) the dish that was served was poor. liver was a bit chewy and a dish like this should not be served with strips of bacon. the waffle for desert was just ok, but they clearly used cheap cream and chocolate sauce. "
"this is a good stop when visiting the drielandenpunt. the view over aachen is very nice. its a relaxed place with friendly young staff and a playground for kids. good coffee. i was less enthusiastic about the food. pancakes were quite thick and tasted a bit stale, like they had been under a heating lamp for a while. "
"the uitsmijter is good, but the service is not that good. even with an almost empty place it took a while until we were able to pay. something that seems weird to me.  the view is great by the way!"
"nice location, nice panorama....structurally cozy environment but.....just for a coffee...or breakfast at maximum ....not advised for lunch....the menu is fully structured on pre cooked and artificial food .....have a beer....dont waste money in it"
"we were here with some friends to have lunch. i tried the schnitzel, which didnt please me. the meat tasted plane, there was some ham and cheese thrown on top and that was it. the fries were nice though, freshly cut in big pieces and crisply fried. there are better places for schnitzel around here, but my friends thought the salad there was good."
"nice location, nice decoration, with a wonderfull playing corner for kids. good service also. food is ok, but average price vs quality ratio. overall it worth a visit or two, specially with kids."
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
considering it is litterally attached to albert hein we didnt get the feeling of being near a supermarket. however if we had sat the near the large window / entrance it might have been differe 
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"we looked forward to our lunch here. very nice ambiance, great decoration of flowers, and cozy atmosphere. we all like a âlongâ lunch but we got here at 12:30 and left at 16:00. not because we were having such a good time, or great food, or lots to dink but due to poor service. it is the worst service experience i have ever had globallyâ¦the staff âdisappearedâ for periods on end. wine glass empty and me dying of thirst. from the seating to the whole meal it seemed like the staff had a big fight among each other and were not with it. according my guests the maitreâd was not presentâ¦which could make the differen "
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
"we stayed more then 2 h at table with two children for a 3-course dining. the food was ok, but more selfmade would be appreciated. my (varkenshaasje) had cooked to long, it should be rosÃ© inside. overall it was tasty."
we liked the food but the wait between courses was longer than expected. portions and side dishes can improve. recommended if you are staying in the hotel or if you leave closeby
"dinner on both days that we stayed there. great recipes and cooking, but too many drawbacks to recomme "
"somehow not very organized. we made a reservation, but could not attract any waiter/ waitress to order a drink. the soup was overpriced (6 euro), and not special/fresh at all."
"nice atmosphere though tables are rather small. we had the venison menu. first course was carpaccio with i.a. qumquat, except that there was no qumquat. second course very tasty. dessert should have been tarte tatin, but proved to be a tasty bit of apfelstrudel. not bad, but should have been mentioned. wines selected with the courses were presented in an informal manner. in summary: not bad, could have been better."
"i come often to the hotel in avegoor (due to its location) and sometimes i dont want to drive out to eat so i go to their restaurant. each time i wonder what it will be like because the restaurant and hotel changes hands regularly and i have had, good, correct and disgusting meals. this time the experience was extremely disappointing. i was there with family and friends and their opinion wasn`t any more positive. across the room i heard a couple rave about the food saying to the waiter that they will be back and i thought to myself - am i so hard to please? or maybe do they know what fine dining is meant to taste like or what are they comparing this food to, macdonalds? the chips and sauces are not home made. otherwise the service was good and the location, especially on a beautiful day when you can sit outside, is great."
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. wonât be returning here soon."
mcdonalds nijkerk takes great efforts to enable the social distancing rules due to the corona crisis. despite busy times this went ok. the food was pretty bad though - for starters none of the big salads were available. the fries were way too salt. the big tasty burger was almost impossible to eat with sauces coming out on all sides.
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
its a bar / restaurant and has the foods you might expect. the quality is good and its a great place for a quick meal.
"combination of a pub and restaurant , but this is not a good combination at all: noisy , alcoholics on the bar. friendly personal , but terrible kitchen."
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didnât seem to care. wonât be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
"i did like the place its pretty cozy and nice atmosphere the host is a little slow but the coffee is good not to cluttered. the menu had little like breakfast dishes to choose from but i still liked it, i still would recommend to try it. what they do have is a great variety of pies and pastries. "
i really like the atmosphere and location but would probably not go back to eat. the waiters came across happy and approachable. although the prices of are quite affordable. we ordered vegetarian burgers. the hamburger bun was a bit sticky and the (vegetarian) burger a bit moist and black at the sides. the burger came with potato chips instead of fries (which we expected of âhamburger with chipsâ). no veggie 
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"we went to the water sport shop in the area of marina horst. and as we still need two hours driving to our destination, we decided to get some warm drink from mccafe that just a three minutes walk from the shop. we also used the restroom. the cappucino was quite good. quick service and clean restaurant."
"after a long ride from the north, we came along for a cool drink. finally i took sundae strawberry. its quick, good service and the staff is very friendly"
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"

"split opinions on this one. i guess expect what you pay for, which is average. we ordered in takeout over the phone and were able to pickup our delivery in 45 minutes. the food was almost finished when we arrived, nice and hot sti "
the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost â¬12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than â¬1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for â¬12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
"we ordered a simple meal, sate menu with salad and fries. the chicken was just done, but still very white. the sate sauce was very thin and runny. the fries and salad were ok. the restaurant also feels old and run down. would not eat here again. "
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
for the prices they charge you would expect a lot mor 
"had dinner with friends at the pizza part of the restaurant. ingredients were not fresh, mostly out of a can. crust was good though. a lot of mistakes were made by the owner, who seemed overwhelmed on a not so busy night."
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual âfriesâ restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
"nice atmosphere, cozy and a bit fancy; nice waiter, but food was a bit expensive,  quite disappointing and not what we ordered (of course was more expensive)"
"if you need a bite in a hurry go there. not bad, not special, average pricing. friendly staff. close to a street with lots of people on bikes.  a rental shop for bikes is next door."
"there is a large terrace and a smaller inside part. decor is a lovely blue and there are lots of coffee specialities. service was good, pleasant place to take a break."
"well, we were recommended this restaurant by our hotel, so we took the 30 minute bike ride to the beach to try it o "
"this place is situated on the beach, so the scenery is ok. also the the decoration is fine. and there it stops. the food is not good, served not warm enough, the steak commes with cranberry and unions, but that combination needs more then just baking. the fish was very fat, probably baked in to much butter and served with north sea shrimps, which were not cleaned, maybe appropriate for gamba style shrimps but not for 15 little dutch buggers! considering the quality of the food and its overpriced. would not return here"
"we visited this restaurant on july 26th with two families - four adults and six children. after not being seated for approximately 15 minutes, we asked a waiter for assistance. he rudely responded that he was busy and would get to us later. after being seated, we ordered water and drinks. the same rude waiter gave us a hard time for ordering water because âthey dont make money on waterâ. after asking for a drink from four different waiters and being ignored in all cases, i complained. the same rude waiter proceeded to get into a verbal altercation with me in front of my famil "
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.

"disappointing, very small portions (seabass was two pieces of 3 by 3 cm only), expensive and quite fat (3 spoons of mayonaise on the frisian carpaccio). we expected more from what is stated to be a michelin bistro."
"this is landgoed lauswolts house bistro which is situated round the back of the hotel and reached by a trek alongside the kitchen and its associated service area. not knowing quite what to expect, we turned a corner to find that the place was absolutely rammed with just our reserved table remaining. we were handed a large menu, in dutch (fair enough,) and left to get on with i "
"we had a superb diner at this place two years ago, which was the reason to stop here for a second time. we found out that the place has new owners and also the kitchen changed .... unfortunately. it is an easy small menu, nothing special and the food was just ok. it took for ever until we where served and for us not a place we would come back.

"nice outdoor dining by the motor yachts. food was good, not great. service was good despite our language barrier."
"we are a group of friends on a boat and wanted to have a good dinner out . the food was good but the service absolutely lousy . not friendly at all , no smiles .. just a very grumpy attitude ."
"we ate here after a long day of travel.  dined on the special, which was a doner type meal not as good as doner joints."
"the location is not special, the decoration is ok, there is enough and free parking in the surroundings. the service was terrible, the waiter asked (2/3 of the table customers) if we fancied something to drink without even handing the wine menu, to the other 1/3 nothing ever was asked for anything at all, 30 min after sitting there and waiting no waiter nor the management came to the table even though our faces clearly showed our discomfort. the menu seemed interesting, i guess we will never know....."
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
iâm at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
after almost 8 months the menu is still the same. bit boring now even though the interial is fantastic and so id the terras.
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "

"
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast â¬12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars.

visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!

"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
good traditional dutch food and atmosphere. is is a pub dutch style plus restaurant. drinks are excellent: good choice. food is good and big portions. you have to make a reservation in the weekends. thursday night specials are advised!
"we had a family dinner here. make sure to check if it is a busy bar evening - to avoid too many drunk people. the food was great, but i was uncomfortable with the crowd at the bar."
"having only a single vegetarian main course does not make you âvegetarian friendlyâ. and the curry itself was not very tasteful neither, especially when compared to real indian cuisine. please, make a bit more effort in offering several choices."
"we had heard good recommendations about the food but were very disappointed by the very unfriendly almost rude manager on duty... i understand corona is a stressful situation especially for restaurants, but no need to be rude to customers... because of this behavior we decided to eat somewhere else (see my review of fletcher hotel schoorl restaurant). sorry for this review... we might try it again post corona... but for now i wonât recommend this."
guess it was quiet here because of the off season timing. this place next to the beach would probably be packed at summer. quite costly but well prepared food. nice decorations and good variation on seating. cannot seat a big group together.
we were in the area & stopped in for lunch. we didnt have reservations so were asked to sit at the bar/counter. we ordered tomato soup & broccoli soup of the day along with some other simple items. we were surprised at how long it took to get our entrees. we all agreed that we have had better service & soups.
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.
friendly welcome and a nice location are the only two positive things i found about this plac 
- a limited choice menu-card.....1 for lunch & another for dinner. printed on paper and worn-o 
"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"deciding to have a quick drink and some food in blarcium, we decided to go to moeke spijkstra. havent been there for a while as the last time it was avera "
orderd mint tea followed by an uitsmijter and salmon club sandwich.  both were prepared simply and tasted good.  reasonably priced and service adequate.
"moeke spijkstra is an authentic local haunt, great for locals, and also for visitors. the ambiance is as traditional dutch as can be - dark brown interior, as vincent van gogh might have experienced it, and persian rugs on the table. it feels warm and cosy, and there is plenty to look at. dont be fooled though, the clientele, typically in their 30s and 40s, are mostly television and advertising industry crowd. not a very welcoming and open lot. the food varies. our mussels were of very high quality and well prepared. also the fries were tip top. "
this restaurant is located in the very centre of town and thats the nicest about it. the dishes are ok but could do with a major overhaul on both presentation and quality!
"nothing special, very overrated, you probably have to belong to the incrodw to apreciate it fully. average"
"a very known pub among the people of blaricum and surroundings. here you can find unknown and known people, young and old, boy and girl. its a nice cosy pub. the dutch often call such a pub a brown cafe. a small town pub. they serve also food and i like the especially the sate. its not a top restaurant but a pub where you also can eat. if you want to eat on a friday or saturday, make sure youre in time and make a reservation. it could be busy. "
"we visited this place twice just recently, and unfortunately on both occasions i was not impressed with the food. here are some examples: pieces of warm bread which we received before food - were actually half frozen. pumpkin soup - i couldnt taste the pumpkin, it was more like a cooked sour cream of an orange colour. french fries - rather tasteless. i only enjoued the burger, and garnalenkroketjes - but why so expensive?!"
"in my opinion i can only say the restaurant has gone completely downhill. we went for a dinner this evening there were only four couples in total the entire evening, so not exactly rushed off their fe "
"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didnât expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menÃ¹ in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, itâs so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "
"- friendly, correct waite "
"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."
having lived in this village we went back for lunch without reservati 
i visited this place more often in the past. had not been for a long time but went here with the team (20 of us) in octobe 
"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (â¬12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, donât even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
the fries taste good. you can make a healthy deal with yourself: first walk to the end of the wavebraker and afterwards you deserve a fat snack ;)
"the staff is unpleasant, the food very expensive, tasteless and too greasy... i would definitely not recommend this place, or just for a drink !"
"terrible service, we had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and the menu. the waiters were not paying any attention at all and were very slow."
i had lunch with my family here very recently. i think it is more attractive in the summer than the winter. the food was good and the service adequate. they must pride themselves in being dog friendly which is great - up to the point where some dogs take a disliking to one another and let all the others know it.
"terrible experience!! food was absolutely horrible! not cooked, appetizers came after the main course!! you need to call them like 2-3 times before they show up ( only 5 tables, with 4 service people)!!! and they have the nerve to charge, 4 stars restaurant prices!!!! they deserve minus 1 star!!!"
keep going until you find some other place!  it was expensive and really awfull! we were waiting 1 hour for the food and no credit card was accepted.
"this is your average beach bar. nice to sit and enjoy a drink in the sun. food is fine, but nothing out of the ordinary."
casual warm lunch offered by friendly staff. croquet and french fries and good selection of beer and wines.
"i liked the setting right on the beach, the weather was very nice and the food was fine. then came the bill and i did not initially notice it but when i looked closer they had charged me one euro for mayonaise that i had not even asked for. a very sneaky way to make some extra money and im sure most people do not even realise and just pay the bill. i pointed this out to the waiter who then became quite arrogant but did give me the one euro back. now this is not whether or not people can afford an extra euro or not, this is about the principle of charging people for something they did not order. not impressed and for that reason i will not be going there again."
"i had dinner here with my wife on a nice summer day. we sat outside which was nice. the food was good, but the service was somewhat slow. overall it was nice and i would give it a 7 out of 10."
"always when the sun is out the beach is crowed. the place is super cool, cosy and nice decorat "
"we had lunch here in august on a rainy day. we had a grilled cheese sandwich, prepared in a pan. nice, but to greasy for my taste. next to that we had ginger cheese pancakes which was delicious. friendly, quick service."
i was there in the weekend for a friends birthday. myself i have an gluten allergy and a friend has an intolorran 
"the restaurant was recommended as âthe place to be â in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
one of many but a good place to sit. the staff is friendly and it is reasonably priced as well. not a bad place at all.
"i went here with a friend. i had a beer and a hamburger (for 17,75â¬). the patty was too thick but the circumference was too small. worse is that the flavor was quite bad: the meat was not tasty, the cheese was not tasty, the sauce was not good, the bun was a bit dr "
"compared wit the other beach restaurants in hoek van holland, this is certainly one of the better restaurants. the service is friendly and efficient. the design and furniture of the restaurant is okay. the food however is moderate."

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"just after a long period of closing, because of corona, this restaurant started up. wher they usely serve a buffet, they now have plate service. the portions were very different: the sate was huge (almost for 2 persons), but the burger was tiny whitout any vegetables. my salmon was juicy en enough for 1 person."
"we enjoyed our simple italian meal in this very convenient restaurant for the return ferry to harwich. however, we were stunned to be charged 9 euros for a bottle of still water. the bill was first marked up as 7 euros and then changed to 9. when we queried it we were told water is expensive in holland. its not."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my satÃ© (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
a quick bite before the ferry sit outside in the sun and enjoy the atmosphere of this small town square. good service and good food.
we were early for our boat back to england and thought wed have a meal before getting on the boat. the homemade speciality burgers at over 12euros were awful & probably bought at the lidl next door. my salad was very average - with chicken straight out of a packet & slapped on the plate. being charged 50cents for a glass of tap water was really mean - even the best restaurants we visited in the netherlands have never done th

"bitterballen were nice. vlammetjes (springrolls) were too oily. chicken sate, the sauce was terrible. drinks were good and all the staff were friendly. just a place for a drink."
staff wasnât very nice and the food wasnât great either. i highly recommend you to visit another place to eat.
"quick, friendly service. the food was well to eat, not high quality, partly products from the freezer, like the firy grilled cheese sandwicg and the satay. the sfere was good."
"we ate here for an early breakfast - one of the few places available. wed eaten here before and had a lovely welcome and delicious food. on this occasion the welcome was fine (but less enthusiastic) and the food was poorer - so were were rather disappointed. most specifically those who ordered scrambled eggs were served chopped fried eggs on dry toast. service was reasonably fast. it is quite popular, filling up quite a lot whilst we were there. well probably eat here again, and give them another try"
"we had as usual a lovely time, took a while to get served our first drinks but after that it went ok. hubby had nice carpaccio, i ordered the calamari, was ok. but you would expect it to be fresh and not bought from the wholesaler. as i can buy it from the same place . but its a beach tent so except it. will come back, but order something else. "
"we were here last week when it was relatively quiet. sat outside in the terrace but it took 3 servers going back and forth before one finally took our drink orders. we found this to be very inefficient. went inside to order dinner and it took an hour for our meal to arrive. calamari was good, bread basket was nice, beach burger was ok, the mussel dish was disappointing. the mussels themselves was nice but the broth where it was cooked in was so sour, that you cant dip your bread in it nor eat the mussels that was swimming in it. complained to the server but just got a ill pass it to the chef response. no further reaction and no apologies received."
"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"iâve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didnât really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"we enjoyed lunch at this place while sitting on the town square. my husband had the fish salad, that was really excellent. my mom had the asparagus soup which unfortunately had ham/bacon in it and shes vegetarian. both kids had a smoothie and a tosti, all fine. i had the vegetarian sandwich with hummus, and vegetables and then they added cheddar cheese. that simply does not go together. the bread was good but the sandwich was not great."
with a group of friends we had lunch and it was okay food. a club sandwich with chicken means thick bread with very thin and few slices of chicken. the others had much better food so perhaps do not take club sandwi

"the restaurant is now named ons gheluk. we had a three course meal a la carte. the soups and carpaccio were nice. as main course we had codfish which was really good. for dessert we had a scroppino, cheese platter and chocolate soufflÃ©. all delicious. the restaurant itself was a bit crowded and noisy. we had a nice evening."
"its 6pm we stepped in and two employers were dining. we waited for 10 minutes for the menukaart. the cafe interior was pretty; however, the food were in small portion, not tasty and expensive."
"a quiet sunday evening with only four tables being sat at...you would think our food order would come on time! the waitress did apologize & our table was given more bread but service, on the whole, was halfhearted. the food was mediocre...my veggie strudel, a  chef specialty was literally two stalks of asparagus with goats cheese wrapped in pastry....not inspiring. another guest had pepper sauce where the peppercorns would have snapped a tooth! so, on the whole, not somewhere i would rush back to...as the title says ~ disappointing."
"bad food, dont go there. food was dated and frozen the service was nice bud got sick from the food."

"do not go there unless you fancy being offended by a sociopathic (and autistic) proprietor who will charge you the same drinks youve already paid for for up to and including 4 times (25+ different people have had, and talked about this experience of which there is undisputable evidence) who has now the time and opportunities of a lifetime to police you and square his weird vendettas with everyone who speaks up in his distopic soon- to-be- extinct establishment by using the powers given to him by qr discrimination. he dwells in it, druling over and savouring from his new possibilities. what a place... but "
"the strandpavilioen luctor et emergo is situated in a perfect location on the dunes of camperduin. great view, efficient system of ordering and paying (you order at the bar and get a numbered token). clean and modern; newspapers of the day available; we ordered a pea soup (erwtesoep met speck) and alas it was not up to dutch standards... maybe we simply have not been lucky"
"fletcher hotels offer a 29,50â¬ 3 course menu, with some classic courses like tomato soup, fish and chips, mixed grill, coffee with sweets. several guests were complaining about the meat: hard and dry like the proverbial old shoe. the fish also wasnt to the mark, a large thick crust on top of a messy conglomerate of hake. some of the desert seemed stale, leftover. the best part all in all was the simple soup. we regularly stay in fletcher hotels and often eat there. they dont offer top gourmet, but mostly we had no complaints. this was substandard."
"the hotel and the service was good, but the rooms some us 15 people got was small. nice staff and good food in the restaurant. the breakfast was okay too!"
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 â¬ for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
"we had a dinner in a pleasant environment. wine list is nice, and worth. starter was a steak tartare, which was prepared very well. this was followed by fowl for my partner, which was prepared very well, and fish roodbaars, which was not prepared well at all (still raw and fishy). so a bit of a pity. cheeses were ok but not remarkable. so overall not a bad choice, but not as good as some reviews make you believe."
popular restaurant food well prepared and good presentation had 3 course menu choice is quite limit 
"michelin 1 fork but its not worth ! nice atmosphere, friendly staff but food was very disappointing. thai chicken soup but there was no chicken in it. fish was not good. poor quality and a chef that cant cook."
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service !

"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"a more than enthusiastic waiter/owner will greet you at this in the middle of this old village establishment. small, maybe 40 seats restaurant with a small me "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"on a cold winterday, we had lunch here. a nice mustard-soup in a far too large bowl. good tasting, but just too much for lunch. we took it with a glass of white wine, verdejo, also good tasting, but not listed on the price list. remarkable. not poured at the table so that we could see the label, the background of the wine. then a price for a moderate wine that is over the top to our experience. we often make an outing to bergen, but we will never go to this place again, sorry to say."
"this place has a bit the style of an english pub; young and old people meeting for a drink, or a smoke outside (blankets and gas lamps). the food is reasonable for dutch standards, and not too expensive. a bit noisy if you want to talk..."
"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didnât get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you canât book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz 
food is ok service slow but worse thing is people bringing thier dogs in .animals eat outside when we asked to move was a major problem
"tasty pancakes and waffles.  however i do not recommend waffles with ice cream and fruits.   coffee was ok, but not the best ever ;)"
"heart warming for parents and exciting for kids - here you get reasonably priced, easy to sell to kids type of food - pizza, pancakes, lasagne! : "
"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"
"tried soup of the day, 2 schnitzel, french fries and apple compote at the restaurant. reasonable good. good and friendly service."
noisy and not so good service. the food was okay! maybe a little bit early in the season for the staff
"this is a large, popular place in a nice location, though very noisy. nice atmosphere otherwise though. service was unreasonably slow and rather confused. dishes are served with chips and salad but these are charged separately and need to be ordered. quite pricey when this is considered"
the place was packed when we arrived and although we had made a reservation for 20:00 we were made to wait for a further 15 minutes until our table became availabl 
large centrally located restaurant in bergen. the atmosphere is somewhat in distinctive and bland. probably your best option for lunch in bergen however.
"we made a reservation for 9 people and were well received. the service was ok, but when we asked if we could order extra vegetables (they only had onions, mushrooms and salad available) the waitress could not help us. turns out everything is pre-prepared and ordered, so they simply dont have separate vegetables to grill. this was a problem because some of us have allergies. the steaks were very well cooked and tasty, but finding out theyre cooked in blue band (margarine) instead of butter (like they say) was another disappointme "

"last saturday we had dinner at loetje in bergen. the weather was nice, so we requested for a table on the large outside terrace. there was some confusion and it took a while before the staff served us. we all ordered the famous steak, but when the plates came, one plate was missing. the waiter apologized and solved the problem as soon as possible. the steaks were nice, but not as great as we are used to at loetje. it is not yet the oiled machine like loetje aan t ij in the north of amsterdam, but it is still a young branch and they have time to improve."

decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
"went here with mr. husband and little one. server was kind and made jokes with the children. little shade on the outside dining area. food was overpriced for mediocre quality and upkeep of the property (roof has clearly visible defects on the restaurant sign, outside tables are quite old) had flammkuchen, average. i think they were topped off with mozzarella (shouldnât that be crÃ¨me fraiche?). fish of the day was a little undercooked. husband had nachos, got almost a whole bag of nachos on a plate with very little topping. asked for extra veggies for little one, got a small bowl of peas covered in dressing. not really fit for a 2yo. also saw them serving pancakes to a child on a hot plate resulting in bur "

"the service was nice, however nobody else except from us was in the restaurant. when asking whether the âschnitzelâ was fresh, the service lady went back to the kitchen to ask and answered that itâs pork when she returned. a deep fried piece was served, dry and definately not fresh. we received one portion of fries where me and my partner should have received our own portion per person as this is what we where paying for. 16 euro for a deep fried single piece of (not even) meat is a joke. weâve paid 40 euro for a portion of kibbeling and a schnitzel, a small coke and a glass of win "
"went here with mr. husband and little one. we were early, servers were still haring diner themselves in the dining area (donât like that "
"from the outside it was already unclear. is it a restaurant or a snackbar. from the menu i would say it is more a snackbar. so i had a bit of difficulty to find a nice lunch.. still a very friendly, easy accessible place to eat and the new owners were doing their best to give good service."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection.

i found place itself somehow wear

"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
"this was a nice enough cafe, although a bit too much like a school cafeteria. the ice cream across the road was great."
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldnât really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happenedâ¦. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the insideâ¦ even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"i went there recently with family for what was meant to be a nice evening out however, i when i left i was not one bit happy or satisfied. i am not saying that this is a totally bad place. actually it is perfect if you want to go with children. it has a nice big play area for the children. the staff are very attentive and friendly. they talk with a smile and are polite. the menu is reasonable with a reasonable pric "
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.ð¶ it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."

"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"with the current owners, vluchthaven has changed from a luxury restaurant to a fairly simple brasserie in which you sit on second- or third-hand furniture. fish is the mainstay of the cuisine which otherwise has mediterranean traits.the food was lovely otherwise, and their white house wine quite good. on the thursday that we visited, the restaurant was pretty understaffed with only one waiter for some 20-25 clients, but his friendliness compensated our waiting time. prices, however, were quite high; we spent some 50-60 euros for a 3-course dinner."
"this is a nice restaurant, only you cant see that its closed between 17:00 and 18:0 "

"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."
"ordered a tosti (bread with grilled cheese), but received one with ham. small accident, no problem, but we dont eat pork. mentioned this to the waitress, but was called a liar. they wouldnt replace the order.   great location, terrible service, would not recommend visiting."
"the food isnât half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didnât eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth â¬15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now iâm sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks itâs ok to throw away â¬15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we donât waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely whatâs going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didnât understand you. and i firmly asked what she didnât understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i donât need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way iâm waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw â¬10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."

we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.

"the food was good, the staff was on and off in their friendliness. we went here twice in august. on monday evening the staff was friendly and quick to help us. on tuesday afternoon, they never seemed to notice my husband. he was in a wheelchair and couldnt just walk to the bar to order a drink. afterwards we found out that they were just with the 2 of them for the whole terrace. that was clearly not enough for a hot day in the high season. a lot of people choose to sit themselves on the terrace after swimming in the pool. the swimming pool was fun, it was busy, but that was to be expected on a heatwave day.

the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasnât bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."

"we were there on our 1st eve. the place was not particularly clean (sticky table & papers on the floor). the meat-burger was ok, but the fish-burger was a fried thin patty taken out of the freezer - or at least it looked and tasted like it. no, nothing fancy about this place."

"the food was quite okay. the hostess, nonna, is wonderfully charming. the reason for a terrible rating is that we asked for 2 simple glasses of water for our 2 thirsty boys and were presented for expensive bottled mineral water. the waitress forgot to mention they refuse to serve tapwater. that was her mistake. what angers me is the policy of refusal of tap water. bottled water is pollution for it is carried from afar whilst excellent dutch tap water isnt. and why? because centerparcs wants to squeeze you for every buck in your pocket and doesnt give anything about our childrens future environment. so please stop advertising how much action you take for being green. it is just another one of your custumor luring schemes."
terrible at best. we waited over an hour for food. carbonara was covered in spring onions... they made another for us but it was bland and gloopy. salmon pasta was the same sauce with smoked salmon on top. ive had far better microwave meals. lasagne was ok. the only saving grace was our waitress who was lovely and clearly embarrassed. we could hear all the tables around us complaining... pizza which you could barely cut through. extortionately priced for the quality.
"organizational skills are hardly up to par. antipasta was served ages before getting our first drinks. pizzas were ok, but the pasta was, besides only being able to opt for penne (which is highly unlikely as pasta for bolognaise), extremely boring and had too little salmon to even mention it a salmon sauce. tasteless and no pepper on the table to spice it up. dessert time was no more satisfying than the prior experiences: the dame blanche could hardly be called a db, the kids cocktail was simple an alcohol-free fizzy drink, the bourbon was served in a gin glass that couldnt fit the ice cube and the aperol was so watery that i am hydrated for the next coming days. wish we would have read the reviews beforehand. this cannot be called an italian restaurant if restaurant at all!"
"we had wait for 20 minutes before anyone came to even take our order and then they got out first order wrong. we took two kids 3-course, a lasagna and another main course and salad. the food was ok without being good. for the kids desert tiramisu there were ice crystals in the ice cream, so either was an old ice cream or not properly stored. all in all, average food and average service in a park where food options are limited"
"it took over an hour for 1 pizza and 2 daily simple pasta dishes to arrive. no apologies from the staff who seemed to prefer to stand and chat to each other rather than serve the customers. our waitress asked us 3 times if weâd ordered - the answer was yes every time and surely when you only have 2 tables to cover you can remember that youâd been and asked us twice before?!finally gave them an ultimatum that if our food didnât arrive in the next 5 mins we were leaving, it miraculously appeared. bolognaise was dreadful and the tagliatelle was very undercooked. will definitely not be returning during our stay and it has put us off the other restaurants at center parcs port zÃ©lande."
1 pizza + 1 pasta 4 cheeses took more than one hour to arrive and it was overcooked... nonna came to see us at the beginning but never came bac 
food took over an hour to arrive and when it did we had to eat separately as the meals arrived at different times. the order had also been taken incorrectly and we were given a kiddies tomatoe pasta instead of an adults bolognaise. the waiter refused to change the orde 
"the food was horrible and ridiculously overpriced  service was bad too, we waited for more than an hour for very basic dishes.a real disappointment"
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really donât understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
food was terribly overcookes and the selection was minimal. terribly below the standard of what you would expect if you spend almost 30 euros per adult.
we are here in the evening. the restaurant is just too expensive for what they serve on the buffet. it is not worth it.
"it looks like an amazing place with a wooden cosy house and a terrace above the sea next to the harbour, amazing food too. but then you find out that the owners are the most unpolite people you can find. we tried to order a beer and to enquire about the food but weve just been turned out by a guy yelling at us as soon as he discovered that we didnt understand what he was saying. the gesture was pretty clear though... very unpleasant and it ruins all the charm of the place."
"we visited bistro skal several times during a stay at the dutch coast. while the service was never particularly attentive and we ended up with half an avocado as a replacement for a falafel (!?), the service on the last day was one of the worst i have experienced. we dropped in for a late lunch at 3.30. there were seven of us, five adults and two children. the waitress was reluctant to give us a table as she needed it back at 5pm. anyway she agreed to take a quick order and we ordered drinks. when it came to ordering food, she flatly refused to serve a single portion of chips for one of the children. her argument was that she couldnât profitably run a restaurant if guest just ordered chips. when we pointed out that we were also ordering six further meals she seemed initially more flexible, but the shutters went down when it turned out that one of the adult diners wanted fish & chips. that meal was only available in child size and there was apparently no option to adjust to adult size. we decided to get a takeaway from the place next door and while we ate outside in the sun, the table we originally sat at was emptyâ¦ a shame as the ambience is very nice and it could be a great place to eat with children."
"food not too bad, but when we were not sure if we should order dessert or not, their reaction in dutch was not very polite - they just didnt realise we understood the lingo! too bad we did..."
"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to â¬10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend â¬50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste. "
"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5â¬ (the wine only cost 10â¬). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldnât go there again. "
"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
a nice place for a drink! but we received far from fresh seafood.. staff is friendly but the kitchen could be much better.
we pre-registered for lunch and had to wait over 30 minutes together with our 2.5 y/o to order our food because the chef was still on a walk with his dogs. after approx. 1h we got the meals. the price was too high for the average quality.
"we visited this place after exploring the region. the location is excellent, with a nice view of the surrounding polde "
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the place its self looks okay... but the staff behind the bar is terrible. they forget drinks a lot of times, promise to make them in 5 minutes and 15 minutes later you still dont have a drink... and when you go back they tell you they forget about it... again. and when they finally bring your drink its the wrong drink. if this would happen once i wouldnt mind... but this happend serval times. the bouncers are absolutely amazing and very helpful."
"we came here for dinner. it was ok. the service was friendly but very slow. i had the carpaccio burger and my husband had the xxl cheese burger. both burgers were ok. flavor was there but the sides fell short. the sides were fries and coleslaw they just seemed like an after thought. they arenât very small child friendly but it was one of the only options to eat at when we got here. there is no changing table so if you have a child in diapers you will have to change them on the floor. we were seated outside which you are allowed to smoke outside so we were seated by a bunch of smokers. we wanted to be inside but iâm not sure why that wasnât an option because we didnât want to be by smokers while we ate. itâs a good atmosphere if you are single, married, or have older kids. seemed a little expensive for what we got. i wouldnât come here agai "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
too bad these people serve fresh mint tea with lice twice in a row and debate that this is normal. giving us the feeling that we are very silly in our complaint.
"very poor service, long waitingtimes. enough people to serve but not easy to make contact with them. pasta truffel tasteless. icecoffee with no icecream allthough this was mentioned on the menu. they brought a new one. nice terrace."
"i got the mixed grill. the chicken and the shredded (shawarma) pork were good. i donât care for the large servings of fries that seem to accompany most of the local meals. i didnât care for the sides that came with my order. iâd pass on ordering the pork skewer again. no english menu available, but staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and accommodating to my nut allergy. "
"highly rated but when we were there it was very disappointing. waiting times were long and food was not of the highest quality. when this was mentioned to the waitress, she felt sorry for us but that was it..."
"service: to slow.  blond waitress: unfriendly, distant, shy.  waiters dont even look or ask if customers need anything."
"restaurant was full, even after people left new people came in to take their table ! good sign, righ "
"this spot isnt my favorite and ive visited at least three times. unfortunately, the first time was ok, and the remainder of times were not good...too greasy, meat was hard to eat and i smelled of grease/oil when i lef "
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin cafÃ©. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "
"nice to see young people serving, but would be a lot nicer if these young waiters would have been properly trained before. we went for a dinner yesterday and got quite disappointed by the service and food quality the "
went here with a group of 10. had tapas menu. we could order 2 tapas per person per round. which i thought wasnt much. but after 4 rounds it was enough! nice place. most of the tapas-dishes tasted good. staff was good t 
"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the satÃ©, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."
i have been here 2 times already. mostly very bus 
"called in for a quick lunch. food was good and service friendly. looks like the locals frequent, so that is recommendation in itself."
this restaurant is unusually located in a former train station building next to the disused railway line (now a cycle path) which operated between turnhout and tilburg. the restaurant has been nicely renovated and now has quite a modern interior with plenty of space and comfortable seati 
"the food was absolutely fabulous, but the staff are just rude and unfriendly; no idea how to be good hosts; its a shame as it takes away from the excellent food thats being served; will not be going back because of the staff"
"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit âtoo muchâ. pick one of the more âtraditionalâ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"this establishment survives by location alone. beautiful views but the food is awful, hygiene poor (bar area, kitchen viewed from bar area and toilet facilities) and attitude of servers verging on rude. go for a drink maybe but donât be ripped off by the price for rubbish food"
"we have often stopped here for a coffee or beer as the location is beautiful. the food menu is basic but if you are just looking for that then it is fine. what i was really surprised by was that the toilet facilities now cost 1 euro, even for guests of the cafe & then to add insult to injury there was no toilet paper & the area needed a good clean. this is totally unacceptable during the coronavirus crisis, everyone should have access to hand washing facilities...there wasnt even sanitising hand gel available at the entrance. this cafe did not fulfil the requirements set out by the dutch government for health at this time."
absolutely disappointing. beautiful location but poor quality food at a price for which you would expect high quality. clients need to pay for washing their hands which is unacceptable in the current situation of the corona virus. pass your way and pick up any other beach restaurant in renesse. 
"visited a gen ing last sunday when we took a break from mountain-biking. we just had some coffees and a tea and ice creams, nothing special to mention. tea and coffee were alright, we were served quickly and had a nice rest on the terra "
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
"the restaurant is located in and old farm. it has a very nice terrace overlooking the farmland. i found the decor a bit disappointing. there is a standard ceiling set and that gives some idea of a football canteen. we enjoyed a buffet with a group of people and the food was of very good quality. it was a good place for our group even, but i would not visit the place for a dinner for 2."
terrible food and it took 1.5h to get the burgers. location is ok but also the stuff is not able to do their job.  never ever a next visit.
we visited teetied on a cycling tour. it has a nice terrace at the waterfront. so we stopped to have some drinks and a small lunch. the lunch chart is a bit limited but the view and location is very nice. we had some tostis and some drinks en enjoyed our stay. perfect place for a short stop-over. i would not recommend this if you want to have a extended meal or lunch.
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"i made a reservation through airbnb worth â¬906 (1 to 30 of april), i received the booking confirmation and two days later (4 days before my flight) the host canceled the reservation. i sent a message begging him, for not to stay on the street sleeping and the host didnt want to know. and my refund money only after 15 days. beware of bookings on this place !!"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"stopped here for drinks. nice location on the river vecht  looking at the lunch dishes it seemed a bit overpriced, lots of bread. well guess you pay for the location as well, nigtevecht is a nice place"
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"service was a little slow, but staff was friendly. prices are decent and the food is of decent to good quality."
"arrived at 17:40, requested 2 for dinner. male manager looked at clock and said ok, we can try. while every other guest was on patio or at windows, we were the only pair put back in the dark, stuffy bar. when the server arrived with no menus, we stared at each other - we had to ask for menus. we put our order in quickly. as we ate, other orders came out with no issue. the kitchen was not closed. food was ok, not worth seating drama."
"grand cafe valerius sounds promising, but in the end we were not really pleased. service was very much depending on the waiter/waitress and the food just wasnt it. the asparagus with ham was much to salty as was the asparagus soup we had as an entree. and the main dish with risotto was to much we could bear: first cooked, then fried. our stomachs couldnt handle it and we didnt eat or drink for the rest of the eveni "
we were there on 2 consecutive nights & on both occasions it took 90 mins for our main courses to arrive. took the enjoyment out of what would otherwise have been good experiences.
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but wonât eat there again!
"kwalitaria is a chain of fast food restaurants (core business deep fried food and burgers); the kwalitaria schiedam is located in the almost one kilometer long shopping street mgr. nolenslaan. the restaurant is almost at the eastern end of the street. i have mixed feelings about this fast food restaurant. free parking in the street, a quick order at the counter, indoor and outdoor seating area and free wi-fi should attract customers. the food is what you can expect from a fast food restaurant so i got what i wished for, but maybe due to the layout of the restaurant, i didnt feel completely relaxed while eating my fries and salmon burger. however, as this is personal, dont let you stop this from visiting the kwalitaria schiedam."
it was quiet when we went here. staff was friendly and the food was tasty and nice. splitting the bill at the register was not a problem.
my burger was supposed to be a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg . i asked no bread to reduce the mount of carbs since i would be having the fries. no problem they sa 
"the person that took our order was very polite and helpful. we got our starters which was âokayâ but shortly after that our main dish was served while i was having my starter. which, most definitely, is not the right approach. the burger itself was twice as small as the bread, abnormal."
very bad service!!! everytime we had to wave for some service. waitress is only talking with fellow worker
old fries. old and too much coating and tiny meat in the hot win 
"i went there recently and ordered a vegetarian dish because i am vegetarian for 10 years. they brought me a pasta that i was supposed should have bbq vegi chicken, i started to eat and i feel this vegi chicken is very similar to real one, tola my friend their product is as similar as real chicken but ask my friend to test it and she told no i think it is the real chicken, i was shocked , the worst answer that i expected,i asked the staff to check my dish and he told sorry we made a mistake!? just sorry ?!and the funny and awful response of them offering me a coupon for a dessert??!! what they think?! i was in a bad mood mentally and physically but i think the first option should change my food and make new one but when i rejected the dessert offer ,they just put 14 euro on my table and collect the food of my friend also , she was between of her dish, it seems they just want us to leave the restaurant and donât say anything about they fault! it is so unprofessional and offensive behavior of their staff! i donât want to go there anymore and tell to all of my friends to donât go there. i donât suggest there at all!!!"
"tried happy italy in schiedam. and wow, horrendous. i ordered a pasta carbonara and a pizza with chicken, paprika and red onion. the chicken on the pizza was of the lowest possible quality and had no taste at all. i wouldnât recommend this restaurant to anyone."

1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"lunchroom soof offers coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, cake, breakfast and hot and cold lunches. what shall i say about soof. they have tried to make an as pleasing ambiance as is possible in a building, that was designed as a shop in the 60s of last century with a good deal of success. service of the waitress is prompt and friendly, the coffee is excellent and the cake delicious. cleanliness is ok, if you disregard the cobwebs in the bathroom area, so why the three point rating. the reason is, that i studied the menu and was amazed about the high prices of the food and drinks in this, lets face it, simple lunch room. even the bill for the cappuccino and cake was already rather eye watering, despite the good quality of the servings. "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"nice atmosphere, friendly service. let down by food quality. the meat dish was mostly good but the vegetarian was poor. undercooked corn tortillas, with processed nacho cheese sauce with what tasted like tinned salsa, with a few tortilla chips from a packet thrown on top..pretty poor effort for the only veg dish on the menu. veggies like nice food too, please try harder."
"was looking for a lunch, light meal. ater 17:00 only dinner menu was available. i choosed chefs choise, a steak. well made, but not more than a ordinary. got a good recomondation on be "
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
very central location. friendly staff. good food. interior lay-out is a bit different. some tlc could be added to the building.
visited here on numerous evenings with work colleagues. the staff were very accommodating and kept the drinks and bar snacks topped up and flowi 
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"we visited this place for a birthday dinner. the location is good, near the water where you can have a good look on the ships passing by. free parking nearby. it was too cold to sit outside, so we went in and were pointed to a table by the friendly staff. inside looks a bit daft, but its part of the experience so to speak with stuffed bears everywhere. ;) some bread for starters, which was good and fresh. several house wines are served by the glass. i ordered the chicken sateh dish, which was simple but good. the fries were a bit cold, but this was solved quick and in a correct manner by the staff. reasonably priced."
this is a reasonable restaurant open late for something to eat and drink.
"they are in the center, and the people are friendly. good beers, sandwiches. nothing special, but very agreeable."
"nothing outstanding about the greek food here -- it was a tad greasy and disappointing. the serving size was large -- but frankly, id prefer smaller portions and better quality. the restaurant was noisy and busy, and the waitstaff were initially brusque but warmed up and became friendlier as the evening progressed."

"lucys restaurant is situated in a hamlet off the main road groningen - emmen. on the menu are mainly english dishes, and thats what makes the difference from other restaurants in the neighbourhood. weve been here twice recently. the first time we came for a real english high tea, with sandwiches, scones and all the other sweat and heary things that belong to it. the only thing i missed was the traditional clotted cream. instead there was unsweatened whipped cream. the tea pot was refilled as soon as it was empty, with several kinds of good quality tea (leaves of course, not bags "
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they arenât attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasnât friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldnât answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help theyâd just say âi am the wrong person to askâ. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "

"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paidâ¦..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"the cafÃ© has a very cosy atmosphere and is situated in the lovely village of de rijp. the service is friendly and ok. the food choice is limited though, good but not exceptional."
"good food, pleasant waitress but snobbish manager. too bad!! wont go back anymo "
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!ð¡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15â for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! donât waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "

"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. itâs definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "
we had not been to urk for many years and decided to revisit urk and enjoy a good fish dinner which should be easy considering that urk is a fishing to 
"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
"had a simple dinner at this greek restaurant which has good food for low prices. itâs really a old fashioned greek restaurant with nothing special but accurate service. they serve traditional greek food, lots of meat but tasteful. donât expect a classy place but somewhere where you can go with big groups. "
i had a lovely dinner with a friend in the olympi 
we had diner in this restaurant and we took the 3 courses surprise menu. even if everything was freshly cooked we didnât find it special. we took the wine pairing and it was a good match with the plates. but we were actually disappointed by the experience. 
"i visited with 3 business associates, we all took the 4 course surprise menu. presentation was ok-ish, nothing special. the taste was quite disappointing. starter base was poached salmon, accompanied by a.o. some wild mushrooms and razor clams, all pretty tasteless. fish course was sea bass which was good, but the accompanying bulgar cooked in saffran was overpowering for the fish. main couse was beef (2 ways) with ratatouille, beef was ok, ratatouille was excellent. madiera sauce was not great. dessert with a cherry base had some red wine vinegar accompaniment which in my opinion was too sharp and did not work. my collegues took the wine accompaniment which they said was good."
the restaurant its absolutely nice to sit its a bit loud inside but nevertheless its a cosy environment. serving is done at a very friendly level. you can say this is a reference for a lot of place 
"beautifull interiour, modern, food average, to noisy, stairs going up and down with people, service good but to busy and very little personal attention."
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the satÃ© and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didnât, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service youâd expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also Ã  la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays â¬3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."

"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay â¬ 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"fast food near the highway.  just a pitstop or a quick leg stretch.  inefficient staff, not very friendly.  food in line with other restaurants."
the veggie burger  was chicken!  and the fries were cold  very unsatisfying and disappointing the waste bins were full so we could not dispose of our food
"usually we came to mcdonalds only for the drink or ice but this time we took mc veggie, too. its not bad at all. service was oke though its a bit slower than normally mcd."
just wanted a mc muffin quick without bacon and a small coffee. ordered and there was enough staff standing there. it took them almost 15 min. really unbelievable. next to that the bread was dry and probably it was to long cooked.
"i went here twice for breakfast as we stayed in the hotel next door, but i must say that it wasnt really fast-food. i had to wait a minimum of 5 minutes for my breakfast order. quality was as expected and the service is the same everywhere."
"seemed to be the only show in town (italian restaurant closed and another one not serving food on saturday after 18.00 ??), never a good thing. long wait, mediocre food, mediocre service. wont rush back."
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."
"attempting to elevate from the level of chips shop, this restaurant leaves a confused impression. its neither this, nor th "
"this bistro is perfectly in an old building directly at the village center. nice terrace to sit outside, if the weather lets you with very attentive staff and good food. nice choice of beers and correct wines."
"average dining and drinking establishment. family friendly, reasonable prices. a bit too loud if you prefer a quieter atmosphere."
"this nice place looks at the beginning like and old english pub, in fact has a good selection of beers. food is also classic of a pub, but with some taste specialties. service is welcoming and quick. definitely worth of a stop if you are on the way."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; itâs just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
"to be perfectly honest, you always get a little lazy and sad after eating there, yet you always come back. its delicious, expensive, but afterward you regret your choice by default."
"the good news is that de beren eetcafÃ© is easily accessible, because the restaurant is situated on the n209 main thoroughfare, close to the bleiswijk ramp on the a12 motorway. furthermore, a spacious parking lot with free parking is part of the restaurant complex. more good news is, that a three course meal is obtainable for â¬ 19.99, value for money in a dutch restaurant. the restaurant is spacious, but the atmosphere is a bit like the burger king, if the burger king had put in a bar and went with the appointments for varnished wood. furthermore, too loud music was being played over the loudspeaker system. the bad news is, that the service and food left much to be desired. service of the staff was pleasant, but a bit bumbling and unpolished (not unique for a dutch restaurant) but broke down completely after the main course. we had to wait 20 minutes till the table was cleared and another 10 minutes till a member of the staff noticed our presence and took our order for dessert. in the mean time, members of the staff were flitting past our table, carrying plates with spare ribs (it was unlimited spare ribs evening). the same thing occurred after the bill was presented. it was impossible to attract the attention of the staff to bring the change. in the end i went to the cashiers desk and got the change there. keep in mind that the restaurant was not understaffed, but insufficient attention was payed to individual tables. about the food: after a promising start, carpaccio, (again augmented with spurious ingredients and salad leaves, but that is, unfortunately, the dutch way), the main course, tuna steak, (one of my favorites) was a disaster. the desert, chocolate nut cake, was of supermarket quality; a helping of vanilla ice cream along side the cake could not mask that impression. furthermore, my table companions complained to me about the substandard quality of the pork and that too much salt was used in the peanut sauce. the reason that i had selected de beren eetcafÃ© in bleiswijk was that i had visited a sister restaurant in schiedam a short while ago (see my review) and was impressed by the skilled cooking in a unpretentious atmosphere, but de beren eetcafÃ© in bleiswijk was a disappointment and we will keep to the schiedam branch in the future."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck

"double reservation in the system! today i was for the 3rd time and the last in this place. i payed online for the 1 hour bowling with my family with 3 kids and 10 minutes before we should start to play we got info from the desk that there was an error in the reservation system and offered to play in 2 hours. after decline od this offer i asked for a money back. the desk person refused it and said it is not per their policy. i insisted on it and finaly got my money back and saying i shall never return there. i feel tricked and dissapointed that this kind of things are happening even today. and appologies or travel compensation were not offered. sad and never again. i guess they kick us out as we had reservation only for the bowling, not in combination with the food. greedy. so if you make reservation and pay full price online, that does not mean you are going to play anyway..."
"nice big place, food is acceptable, better than average bowling place. the bowling is very professional. the sate was to small and the fish was to much, so not balanced, the meat was to seasoned with salt. medium rare was more rare. spinach was to salt."
"ballys is a nicely decorated place in the middle of the industrial estate plaspoelpolder. it is a great option for a corporate event like a farewell party. during our party the drinks were served quickly, but the second order of fried snacks (bittergarnituur) took a really long time to appear, maybe due to an overloaded kitchen."
"the bar is good: good beer, great service and an overall relaxed atmosphere - whats not to like? the food however is well... edible, really your usual pub grub like hamburger or salmon with a dutch twist. dont misunderstand me, you will not go away humgry just that the food is not memorable in any way."
i ordered fish and chips for lunch. you would expect the fish to look at least fish-like but what i received looked like a large fish finger.

"had a valentines dinner here in feb 2015; staff was very friendly, and even decorated the table for me and my wife! food was what you can expect from a tapas place, its tasty, but a bit of an overload in oil/garlic (which is perhaps part of the cuisine?) - but that kind of makes every dish taste very similar! all in all, would certainly come back again due to friendly staff, and the fact that oil and garlic are actually quite tasty. a bit more variety in taste wouldnt hurt though!"
"i went to try the tapas with my husband and since we must work until 8 pm, were a little late for the all you can eat.. but we dont mind to speed up because were so tired too. the bill came up 70 something euros! we ate only a few tapas and it wasnt even meet the standard of tapas on the street of barcelona or malaga.. so dissapointed we will never eat here again! you can never get a second chance for first impression.."
we had the all you can eat tapas option for â¬20 per person. that is s bit of an overstatement due to the rules and the kitchen slownes

"we went for a family birthday lunch on a sunday. we choose the restaurant because it offers an a la cart menu; because some of us donât like fish and would like to eat the vegetarian or meat options. arriving at the restaurant, we had to call twice before they would open the gates for the parking lot. this should have been a warning. one of the tables was unsteady, so we asked for a coaster to support the table. they promised to do it immediately, but instead were busy discussing the daily life. we asked again, and got a rather annoyed look from the staff but in the end did receive the coaster. when we received the menu, not all of us wanted the surprise 3/4 course menu or the regular 3/4 course menu. since the waiter didnât inform us that those two menus were the only options, we wanted to order a la cart options, but were informed in a rather condescening way that this was absolutely not possible. only when we said that most items on the menu for a certain member was not possible, did it become possible if the whole table would make the same order. although we did receive an apology for that choosing a la cart options was not possible, we thought the communication was bad. in the end we selected a couple of courses from the chefâs menu, and we also added wine for each course. we received the first two courses within 2,5 hours, and asked for a cheese plate prior to desert. it took 1,5 hours before we received the cheese plate; by the time we asked for the cheese plate again, it arrived within 10 minutes and the desert arrived 15 minutes later. we had the wine with all the food, except with the desert no wine was given. and when asked for it, it was too much effort to arrange it for us (even though they receive a fair amount of money for the wines if they had arranged it for us "
"we celebrated our weddings day there, ordered a surprise 4-course menu. unfortunately not surprised. the wine selection was good, the beefsteak was too raw and bitter, cheese too simple for a surprise. i do not recommend - a good service though."

"where to go on a monday evening? we thought we would like to come back at savarin. it became a big disappointment. the new decoration made the restaurant very noisy, also before the big group entered. it is hard to handle such a group without spoiling the evening of the others, it became clear the staff couldnât. for half an hour no table was actually served in the whole restaurant. the staff appeared more instructed than trained, saying the right things on the wrong moment. also with good intentions it is hard to work in the wrong setti "
"as we live in old rijswijk we thought of giving this restaurant a try. the quality of the food was very good and the very young and rather inexperienced waiters did their best in a satisfactory way. our problem came with the dessert. there were two desserts of choice: one based on blueberry mousse and sorbet, and the other based on cheese panna cotta. we all ordered the panna cotta, but, t our surprise, we were all served with the blueberry mousse. we notified the waiter who obviously didnt know what to do, so he went back to check with his superior. when he returned to our table he started explaining us that the blueberry sorbet is in fact some kind of cheese panna cotta. as we didnt like to be taken for idiots, we asked for his superior. when his superior came, he had a very arrogant and patronising attitude and restated that the blueberry sorbet is in fact the panna cotta we ordered. he was very persitent and i had to confront him with the menu to make him admit that there was some confusion. this attitude is absolutely unacceptable from somebody working in services and who has the minimum respect for his customers and for his job! but apparently the guy doesnt have any notion about respect as he was trying to lie us up-front."
"chefs of restaurant savarin, part of les jeunes restaurateurs deurope, not only display culinary craftsmanship oriented on european gastronomy but also use organic ingredients. a special voucher action brought us to savarin, where they served us a three-course menu with veal as main course. the meat was tasty, it had a reasonable quantity and was complemented with only one asparagus, a little heap of sweet potatoes and a tablespoon of mushrooms. it seems that savarin only likes to fill up the restaurant, but refrains from attracting new customers with voucher deals. the price for this menu was too expensive for what was offered to us."
"visited restaurant savarin with our birthday party. from the moment we made our reservation we experienced the poor quality in service of the restaurant staff. a 3 course dinner is rather expensive at euro 49,50 and contains no special dishes, but the frustrating part of the evening was the coffee/tea. coffee was served without the sugar/milk tray for which we had to ask at the bar, but most of all the sweets were served after we had finished our coffee. btw. we did not order the friandises, but they were put on the table without asking. i mentioned that we were given the friandises after we had fisnished our coffee to the head waiter and he said he was sorry about this, but that was it. ( eur 7,50 for the cofee pp.) nothing to compensate his guests. this me made me feel a second rate gue "

"i usually only write reviews when i really liked a dinner, but this time i was so disappointed that i make an exception. we had thought about going to the savarin restaurant for some time, so when there was a special voucher action, we figured it was the right time to try. unfortunately, it is obvious that they are not trying to win new customers with their voucher deals, but just to fill up their restaurant. while the food was tasty, the menu was totally basic, so that in the end the price we paid with the rebate actually still felt overpriced. but ok, i understand that they cut a few corners there and you just dont get as good a deal as you had hoped. what really surprised me was the level of service. it starts with the fact that they put way too many tables in the restaurant, so that the servers have to squeeze between the tables. guests are constantly moving their chairs because the feel they have to make room for the passing servers. of the three servers we had only 1 was close to the standard i expect from a restaurant with a 50 euro menu. one forgot was on the plate when trying to explain the main course, the other never bothered to ask whether we liked the dinner when removing the plates. the waiter did not see when glasses were empty and it took ages to be able to order drinks. not just for us, but also at the surrounding tabl "

mac donalds on the road dont go there its a hell oh for i forget the big fat drunk boss i realy did not like his big mouth in the hotel/hostel
visited the restaurant and although the food and wine were nice t was way over priced. most wines were in the â¬30-45 price range and frankly they werent bad but i have had way better for wayyy cheaper. the food wasnt bad but 2 days after my visit i already have a hard time remembering what we had. more inspiration is needed to make this resto living up to its nam 
"this restaurant pretends to be upscale, but serves poor quality food. our group (15 people) had to wait more than an hour for the main course because as the staff explained they had a lot of guests to serve. which made me wonder what we were.... this place has to learn a lot about food, very poor quality and serving guests."
"i donât think iâll be back any time soon, the pistacho pesto pasta was bland and slightly uncooked; clearly prepared by someone who doesnât have a passion for food.. the pizza was ok: crunchy crust but slightly salty, nothing special. staff was kind but inexperienced."
"we visited with hubby and little one, when my mom visited from greece. we know italian food and were not delighted with what they served but neither disappointed. some of the plates were good and some were blah! waiter was very friendly. wine lovely. kids friendly too. not bad for an afternoon after shipping when you havent got any time to cook ;)"
the food is nothing special and quite honestly the pizza tastes like it was a frozen pizza and the pasta was bland. i wouldnt recommend this place at all.
"spent an evening here with colleagues. we were a group of 6, and arrived at around 19:00. service is friendly, and the atmosphere is nice. the speed of service however, isnt amazing. we received our starters around 21:00, and our main course around 21:30. one of our collegues unfortunately had to leave before his main course arrived, he hadnt expected to have to wait close to two hours for his fo "
"the atmosphere is nice and the service friendly. the food is average, at least what we had. we had a pizza (ive really tried better pizzas before), cannelloni (at least average), tuna filet (not bad) and a beef filet with pepper sauce (not bad)."
"under new management for about three years now, the restaurant now offers good italian food sicilian style (rather than northern italian, from where the former owner originated). pleasant atmosphere; nice view of the old rijswijk church from the window tables and terrace, the restaurant is currently also open for lunch. "
"upscale italian restaurant with italian owner who gives a lot of attention to his guests. fairly long wait times for the food, expect to spend the better part of an evening. good wines. the menu looks very interesting, but i have to say the taste of teh food was rather average, on the bland side. no real taste surprises. "
"my parents were celebrating their 63rd wedding anniversary with my siblings at de wits on 28.08.2021. i could not come as i live in the uk. i called the restaurant, while they were having dinner, to order a bottle of champagne as a surprise for them, offering to pay by credit card. regrettably, the person answering the phone at de wits (i guess the owner/manager) said no, i cant do it as im too busy, and theyre all drinking fris (soft drinks) anyway. not only does he turn my business away, but he seems to feel entitled to decide what his guest should be drinking. some attitude, h "

"we ordered the toast veggie for lunch and the amount was a joke, just one poached egg with 5 thin slices of avocado. we certainly finished the dish in 2 minutes and told the waitress how disappointed we were about the amount, to which she replied that it was meant for breakfast. after having taken a look at the menu, we told her that actually, it was under the lunch menu to which she just replied: ok! if you are still hungry, you can always order something el "
"went here with a group of 15. had to place orders in advance. although last minute changes were made, staff remained friendly and helpful. food was good enough and was served in a timely manner. would go back next time when in rijswijk"
"a restaurant like many others, nice service and average cuisine. the fish of the main course was slightly smelly, the starter was ok. all in all not unforgettable!"
"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros â¢	nice terrace in busy street â¢	excellent wine is available â¢	service is good â¢	prices are realistic, not too high  conâs â¢	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"
the interior of this place is rather roomy and classy for a greek restaurant. it offers a wide range of menu items that seem more authentic than youd get at the average run-of-the-mill greek in your neighborho 
"the food is ok, but the place needs a facelift and the service is terrible. they forgot our drinks order several times! this place is not really recommendableâ¦"
"nice friendly eating cafe in rijswijk, also friendly for a drink in the evening. nice atmosphere and friendly."
this is a very local watering hole. has been there for over 30 years and a good place to have a drink and bitterballen. its nice enough but what is a shame is that to get inside you have to go through the front conservatory seating bit where there is a big cloud of cigarette smoke.
lady who was taking order by mcdrive was very rude. it happened 1 september around 17.10. this is the reason that we are not going to visit this place anymore.
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because itâs close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, iâve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but iâd rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so iâd like them better"
"we were a company of several people who had different dishes. the meat or fish was good, but the side dishes were boring. as everywhere else in the netherlands they only serve french fries and creamy sauces. very good service and friendly staff!"
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"
"theres little to redeem this place. set on the side of a shopping centre and over-looking the brutalist building of the local city hall, the food was equally uninspiring. its trying to lean up-market but should really stick to capturing the shoppers for coffee & cake or a lunch-time sandwich."
"we will never go back here. the menu looks very tempting, however when the food arrives nothing as it was said on the menu. never again!"
it used to be one of our favorite greek restaurants. a few weeks ago we went there with the whole fami 
quantity of gyros and tzaziki could be better. also feta was poor in the salad. menu is good as well as the red house wine.
"the food here was good and plenty. dinner comes with bits of potato and a salad. plenty of choice for everyone and kids menu available. service was ok as well, but what i suspect was the owner or manager was a bit dismissive."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than â¬ 6,00 per bottleâ¦.!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!
"food not cooked well, ingredients mentioned on the.menu not found! dirty cutlery, unfriendly service. gone before dessert was served to never coming back!"
"we picked this restaurant for a family dinner, based on previous experiences by some of our group who had eaten here as a coup "
"the food was good, the prices are decent, the staff can not handle the number of guests. you really ger a slow service."
this restaurant is in the middle of the centre located at the nice harbour but unfortunately you cannot view that out of the restaurant. the food is ok as is the atmosphere; if you make a reservation ask for a table downstairs as the few tables upstairs make you feel a bit lonley.

"we ordered take away dinner during covid lockdown. i read reviews before and wanted to try their spare ribs, which were good. but rest is simply horrible: veggies and fries are from cheap, deep frozen industrial ingredients. salmon appetizer- is simple a smoked salmon that you can find in any low quality supermarket and put on your plate. seriously if you do great meat dishes, why donât you invest in nice garnish? because it ruined all the experience (("

"i always order delivery for this bussiness. from all the orders throughout the year. i think there has only been one order that was delivered with all the add ons as i ordered. i thought after two months or so, i give it another try. i never posted a review.today was the last straw, the two pizzas i ordered one was correct. the second pizza was once again not the one i ordered, a conpletely different one. i contacted the company: i requested the correct pizza for free this time, maybe not to friendly. they did not agree to that since they have no registration of the previous incorrect orders, despite them once having given me a free order after an earlier debacle. might be because i order without an account. a dessert was offered, i refused that. now i got the correct order, however still with a spice i specified not to add. once you get the pizza the quality is good, but okay considering pricing. for me this was the straw that broke the camels back for the delivery option. i dont know if they give the wrong order to the delivery person or that it already goes wrong when reading the order.i am just one customer, but how unlucky can you get? i used to recommend this pizzeria to friends and family, but i will no longer do so."

the worst dinner we ever had at a restaurant and very expensive ! this restaurant was Â«Â bookedÂ Â» by the b&b we were staying at and we discovered the principle when we arrived: 4 meals Â«Â surprisedÂ Â» for 45â¬.
very bad and aggressive owner !!!! bad food and sour peppers ð¶  and he got mad because if it crazy never seen this before!
"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"

"a place which really benefits from its location. a good 20minutes walk to anywhere else means you have few options. consequently, this place can inflate its prizes for what you get. good is good. but expensive."
"i really want to like olive because i like to support local restaurant but i just am not impressed. they canât seem to decide what type of restaurant they want to be. is it greek, italian or spanish? do i have a main course or do i have tapas from a small selection? the patio is nice and in the summer you have an amazing view. but after trying this place twice i donât plan on giving them a third chance. "
"even after eating here i am not sure whether the main focus of the place was italian or spanish or greek. for the most part, it ended up not offering the best from these countries. the selection of dishes to offer seemed slightly strange. four of us ate there and decided to have tapas/mezes only. some of the plates like the calamares and the patatas bravas were ok â it is hard to mess these up. the pumpkin balls were also good, however the greek salad was as far removed from a typical greek salad as the moon is from athens. it was dire. the house red wine â italian â was ok but pricey. the first bottle that we had was too warm. the outside decking area was ok but nothing special. the service was a bit inconsistent â some of the waiters were better than others. i do not remember seeing any female staff - strange. i am sure you will find better places to eat in vleuten"

"this is a wonderful place to take a break from a bike ride. the restaurant has an outdoor terrace with service adjacent to the main building. in the back, across a narrow lane and right on the water is a simple dock over the river angstel, with seating and self service - you place your order at a window and are called when it is ready for pick-up. no frills, but the views over the meadows cant be beat."
"this location (maarssen) did not answer the phone, twice. then tried to order online. in my basket each pizza is suddenly â¬1.50 more expensive than listed. then tried calling the paid number. it asked my zip code to then bluntly tell me there is no location near me (seriously?) and hung up on me. congratulations with the worst customer service experience we had in a long time. "
horrible experience. today march 15. no entrance. no hostess for reception. no drie gangen menu. horrible bad food. crap ambiance. i used to go to school there. the waitress had long hair and not up. she didnât speak dutch. ukrainian. the food was the worst i have ever seen. never again. construction everywhere. no one knew where the chef was. he wasnât there. the website looks fab. the experi nfe and the food was scam. the only good thing was the bandol rose. wine list is great. donât go there
i am very sorry but in my opinion this establishment is not worthy of the number one position of restaurants in maarssen.there were 5 family members on a saturday evening.the food is no better than average.my mixed grill was similar to what you get in any kebab joint.the starter took half an hour to appear and the main course another one and a quarter hours.i complained to three different members of staff.one even had the audacity to dispute the length of time between courses.she argued that it had only been 45 minutes which was acceptable!this was a lie.i was then told by yet another staff member that our 5 meals would be delivered in 4 minutes.they arrived 20 minutes later!!there were no apologies but they could see we were not happy so offered a free drink.this was little compensation for such incompetence and undiplomatic behaviour.needless to say we did not bother to order a desert.we could see that various other customers were also dissatisfied.there are numerous restaurants in maarssen and most are better than this one.i recommend that you give this one a miss and spend your money elsewhere.
"claim to be vegetarian friendly, but do only have meat main courses on the menu. old-fashioned, unnecessary, not customer friendly."
"this is a restaurant of 12 in a dozen. nice if you are in the neighborhood but not really worth the travel. we had a very niece evening but that ws primarily because of our the audience. the menu is very conservative, the selection of wines not very exciting. food was ok prepared but my steak was well done while i ordered medium. it is these little things that make it average. the price is very reasonable. so we had a good night but the restaurant was nothing special."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.

"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."

"the place is great, the food is not (anymore). has there been a chefs change? we ordered chicken risotto and the vegetarian wellington. the risotto was undercooked and not fresh (warmed in microwave?). the vegetarian wellington was a lot of puff pastry with almost no filling. you literally had to search for it. i would seriously advise the owner to search for a new chef, as todays food scares of people."

"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"restaurant smulwereld de poshoorn has evolved from a fast food restaurant to an establishment with a wider scope, by offering also a menu with chinese dishes. as de posthoorn is run for the last couple of years by a family from the far east, this is not surprising. ordering is at the counter; the food is brought to you at your table. the service is polite and genuine hospitable, the fries are prepared with fresh cooking oil and the prices are moderate. furthermore, outside seating is provided, so you can watch the life in voorhuizen go by while eating your burger or babi panggang. not a restaurant on the must do list, but a safe bet for a quick and inexpensive meal when in the neighborhood."
"smulwereld de posthoorn is good for a quick stop on the way the replenish your stomach. de posthoorn has many advantages over the big fast food chains: it is situated in the center of voorthuizen at the road parallel to the main road through voorthuizen with no parking restrictions, the restaurant has the traditional counter with the deep fryers for take-away, but there is a cosy corner with 4 tables with sit-down service. the food is of course the dutch kaleidoscope of deep fried food products, but the french fries with sauce, salad and kroket, frikandel, satay and more are served on real plates with real cutlery. far better than the big chains. the restaurant is quiet, no blaring music and when the weather is clement, there are outside tables to seat at, even improving the experience, eating and watching the traffic go by. unfortunately, voorthuizen is in the middle of the veluwe, popular with tourist on bicycle tours, so the outside tables tend to be snapped up quickly. no culinary feats are accomplished at de posthoorn, but it is ok within their limitations."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "
after visiting radio kootwijk we stopped at this cafetaria for something cool. the location is in the shopping centre of voorthuizen. its very nice sitting outside on the bench with a cup of ice in your hand
"the restaurant kwalitaria de daltons is a fast food restaurant in the center of voorthuizen. the restaurant is, together with a row of shops, situated along a medium sized parking lot. dont forget to put out the parking disc; parking is time controlled here. it was glorious weather, so we settled down on the outside terrace for a quick lunch. this terrace is a bit dingy and cramped, but it serves the purpose. service on the terrace is offered, but was spotty and aloof, so we ended up ordering the food and drink at the counter and we took the serving tray with our order to our table ourselves. the food, french fries with a vegetarian snack, was mediocre, even taken into account the reduced expectations you have of a fast food restaurant. prices were at the upper side of the expectations. kwalitaria de daltons will not be our first choice in the future when stopping in voorthuizen."
it took the waiter a long time to arrive at our table to take our ord 
"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
by far the worst mcdonalds ive ever been to. cold food. low working pace. rude employees. dont go!
"food was okay, location is good, service is very bad. first you are not allowed on terrace to have only a few drink, one have to eat here. after ordering some lunch and just after food arrived a larger group came to sit next to us but had too few space, couple of times they were told out loud by the waiter that our table was free very shortly so they could all sit normally. we were just eating our lunch and took our time of course. but when i paid the bill i was not even given time to stuck away my wallet, the table was cleaned while i was still sitting there getting my stuff together so rude it was. "
stopped in here for drinks while passing through town with a large group of three to four tables on the pat 
"we ordered two coffee for me and my wife and 1 smoozy for our kid, but all other people around us (that also came later) got their orders (same coffee and smoozy as well), we asked waiter a few times to bring the order faster as we really need to go soon. without real help, he just said that theyre busy. after waiting of 30 minutes (!!!! yes - half an hour for drinks) i came inside caffee to asked whether its ready or we can just cancel it as we dont have time anymore, but bartender jumped out of the bar and started scream on me like in front of my friend, another waiter and people: yes, were busy! in what country its not normal for you to wait such time for drinks?! dont talk to me like this! take your coffee, pay money and get out of here as soon as possible!. if he would not be so small and fancy guy a few times less than me im sure he would start a fight, but after he came too close to me he realized that he overestimated himsel "
"not so good food is below expectation, simpel , far from being named as restaurant  service was poor, i get it, it was busy day"
"terrible service, the food was not bad, but the service is the worst i have ever had.  it is a pity that the place has a very good location."
"ordered from the lunch card sardines, flammekuche bacon and one with salmon and a hamburger. the sardines were big and really nice. the flammekuche were really small and not enough for a lunch. the burger was ok. coffee was good. all in all it was a little pricey for what we order "
"at the spot where earlier an italian restaurant was located is now a dutch brasserie with nice weather find (not easy, because is populair)  a table near  the waterfront. great fun to watch sailors struggle. the food is considering the attractive price a deal good."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
"i ordered a simple chicken dish. and it was supposed to be delivered after 40 minutes. after 40 minutes, they changed it with another hour and so on. called to cancel, but no one understood english. never going to order from here again."
we were undercharged and tried to correct this.  they then overcharged us.  when we complained we were barred!!!
"ordered at beanthere a couple of weeks ago. our food was horrible, every piece of chicken in our meal turned out to be still pink on the inside. me and my friend got struck by food that wasnt cooked well, we both ended up with horrible stomachaches the same nig "
"beanthere has a nice selection of surinam dishes to eat in or take away. the place is rather dark and lacks atmosphere, but service is friendly, though not very fast. but the dishes are are freshly made and very good."
this place is another option for coffee lovers....their coffee variety are superb.....should try the coffee mocha is so tempting
the waiter had no manners at a 
"the meal was good but its too expensive for what it was. so simple yet so expansive. moroever, the water costs 6 euros ?!! what kind of water is that to be this pricey..."
"the food is very good. i wish they had more options.  the price is not a fair price. they dont take your order you have to walk to them once you want to order food.  friendly people, i just wish there was value for money."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   iâd have coffee again but iâd leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
this is just a very low key dining experience but the food was well prepared.  it overlooks the river which adds to the experience.
good location but lacking in food performence. the dutch like their fries and know how to cook them. but here served lukewarm&soggy. the fish was deep fried and the sate not well grilled. this can be done a lot better even in the dutch kitchen m. but again the location is nice and next time i will go for the cafetaria and take the white bun with kroket with mustard and enjoy it outside on one of the bench 
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20â¬ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. iâm not sure iâd bother going again. 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 â¬. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
"you can have a great party i guess, but it is an old brown bar, that is in need of some tlc. you can play biljart and you can sit down at a slotsmachine, and you can have some coffey and pie if you are visiting schoonhoven."
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.

"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garÃ§on served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.

"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 â¬ had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50â¬ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40â¬."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!

"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
when we visit sluis we love to stop there for a crepe. good and fast service. they show beautiful plates with exotic fruits but the fruit is not always good ... too bad they do not have a terrace . which we prefer in the summer.. 
nice place with air conditionning but some areas should definitely be cleaned.   ice cream but no lactose-free once.

my family and i stopped here a couple of days ago for waffles.the waffles were good but nothing special. the waffles were 12 euros with fresh fruit and ice cream. the young male server that waited on us was rude and expressed his frustration with our inability to understand the menu which was in dutch and german.
i wanted a waffle with strawberries and my wife a small fruit salad. they brought a whole contraption of fruits... nothing special other than the presentation and they charged 12 euros a plate. on the menu wasnt even liste 
me and my family orderd a simple dish. we waited in total of a 90 minutes on our food. the food was good but service is terrible. also a (tip for the owner) hire more waiters from dutch origin. many couldnt understand us beaucause they didnt speak the local language.
terrible service sat there about 50 minutes after asking for a radler beer had to point to the drink i wanted on the menu as the person serving could not understand dutch or english waited and waited but no drink left after 50 minutes never again need more staff and ones who understand dutch or english
we went in for a quick lunch on what was possibly one of the busiest days of the year. it took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to serve my first bite! they didnt even put bread on the table to nibble on! food was so-so. nothing special. the waiters were very nice and doing what they could. i think the problem is in the bar and kitch 
"although the speed of service was not the best , the setting and decor was good and the outside terrace was excellent for a summer day.very child friendly. our meals were seafood (mosselen&sole) and were very tasty."
"we tried paling and mosselen. very good mussels, eel was a bit less: too soft. its a pity they dont contract an extra waiter, specially during nice summer days when terrace is full of waiting people..."
"this is a nicely located reataurant with a large dining area in the garden at the rear which we used and it was very pleasant. however, service was very slow even though the place wasnt very busy. my starter of prawns and mushrooms in garlic was excellent but we had problems with our steak mains. my wife will not eat meat which is even faintly pink so we asked for it to be medium to well done. when it arrived it was raw in the middle and dripping with blood so it was sent back. when it reappeared there was very little difference so, rather than labour the point, she just left it. im not a fussy as my wife but my own steak was too bloody for my liking, even after it, too, was sent back. we were then treated to a lecture by the rather condescending waiter on how steak should be cooked and what you should ask f "
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"we visited zeeuws vlaanderen for a weekend. were dutch and the zeeland province is our birthground. sluis is a transformed little city with no charm at all. its a an allover moneymaking area and this restaurant was an important part of pur dissappointment. we had an 2-scope icecream with a kind of spraycream and an espressocoffee for around 15 euro! the espresso was good... the icecream was not. in sluis you can get a parkingplace...youd have tompay the fee for an entire day ... even if you want to visit the supermarket. for us no problem, we domnot need to stay there, but imagening people being on holiday with the family... they dont say no , they wont spoil the day! they should say no.. because theyre ripped off and seated on that terrace i felt ashame to be a dutch national"
"we ordered the pancakes with tea for â¬4,50. unfortunately the pancakes are small and nothing special. one of them didnt seem to be baked properly either. wouldnt come back for dessert."
"a sign outside promoted paling in het groen for â¬23,5. inside the menu stated â¬24,5 "
we ordered a normal round of drinks at this restaurant and then asked for glasses of water as well at the same time. when four bottles of water arrived with our other drinks and we said we had wanted tap water we were then told we dont do tap water. this hadnt been told to us when we ordered. we then proceeded to wait 45min for toasted sandwiches one of which was burnt. an unfortunate experience. 
"last week-end we (2) went to this place for the second time. sunny day, lots of people outside, and inside. we were here already once and had a salade niÃ§oise which was really ok. we even recommended the place a couple of months ago to friends who did complain about the poor quality. we were surprised. but last sunday (07/04/2013) we understood hem. although the place is clean, we had poor food quality (i had asian spareribs where 1/3 were barely grilled and still pink inside.) my partners white wine had a cork taste and the waitress told us this was impossible because it came from a carton container ( we have a serious wine experience and know when there is a cork smell/taste). she was quite blunt. the scampi from my partner were small and without taste, too much cream that was too liquid. my rosÃ© wine was ok (at last). we decided to pay the bill and go. when going to the mens toilet i had the very awful experience to discover the toilet left full of excrements on the seat (yes i am not joking). i understand that its not he owners fault but when i did reported this to the waitress, i had a very grumpy answer instead of something like oh were sorry sir, well check this immediately and thank you for reporting it. never again!"
we went there based on the positive previous reviews but left disappointed. the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly but the food was just not good enough. the fish stew was overcooked and the pasta was dripping in oil.
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said â5 more minutesâ which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked goodâ¦"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant ð´ is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish ð soup ð², but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries ð are ok ð, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesnât really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesnât has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"

"we went here many times before but now they have started a new process for ordering and it is no longer very nice. you now need to take your table number and order at one of the two kiosks entering in your mobile so you can receive a sms when your drinks are ready. i appreciate the use of technology but for a nice restaurant, i wish they would have kept it traditiona "
"this restaurant looks nice from the outside (itâs an old windmill) and the interior is cozy, especially the part in the historical building. we were sitting for less than a minute when the waitress came to take our order (good points for speed you should think), because we even hadnât even had the time to open the menu. we may as well not have done that, because we had to wait for a long time for her to come back. when we finally could place our order, she indicated we can only have drinks in this part of the building, and had to move to the other side of the restaurant. when we did, we again waited for half an hour to place our order. the waiter was impolite and inattentive, the food and hot drinks were so-so and over-priced. you can find cheaper and better in sluis, the historical building is not a wild card to charge high prices for bad food and slow and impolite service, plus rigid rules about where what could be consumed."
"the place is pleasant, but the food is so so. the service is not so bad. it is only an option, if you meet the place and do not like to go far."
"its interesting to see the windmill, we went inside the shop next to the restaurant.  we made a decision to go to the restaurant because of the location, quite unique, modern interior in an old windmill"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"now the restaurant is called âle petit parisâ, worst experience ever. the fish was overcooked and the chicken from cesar salad was unchewable :-("
this restaurant came recommended to us by someone in the family who had visited it over a year before. im not sure if things have drastically changed or if we came on a very unlucky day but this was one of the most infuriating and disappointing meals weve had in a long ti 
"a very busy restaurant. but it ranks in the all form no function scale. the thai curry took 45 minutes. once delivered a few of the pieces of chicken were raw. no one asked about the obviously raw pieces carefully moved out of the center of the bowl. the bill for the raw chicken, one water and one wine was 28â¬. praying i donât also pay with illness later today. "
this restaurant offers a comfy cozy interior and quite friendly and swift servi 
"very nice restaurant, but unfortunately the food was average, was a bit bland if compared to other greek restaurants. the service was lacking, we werent even asked if we wanted dessert."
"not horrible if youâre not a greek food fan.  i really wanted greek and felt i got dutch trying to be greek. no authentic grape leaves for example. overall, just lacking atmosphere and authenticity."
"we regularly have lunch in this restaurant. many people here are regular guests. i took the oven baked fish with wine sauce, it excelled in being tasteless. my wife took the flemish stew and enjoyed it a lot. depending on what you take you will enjoy it more or less. the service is always very friendly."
"have visited this eatery previously & has always been ok. however, on a recent visit to sluis me & my husband decided to have lunch here, now they welcome people from uk but do not have an english menu which i find ignorant & not very keen to explain their menu. that said we selected a tuna baguette each & a beer & diet coke. as we donât speak dutch, we failed to notice a sur charge on all baguettes of 1.50 euros on top of the price of a standard roll. this took our total bill to 26 euros!!! really for 2 blooming rolls & 2 drinks iâm sorry this is a real rip off & we will never be going back. we did approach the waitress who conveniently said we should have asked: we did & she chose to not understand us. what a rip off!!! avoid as very expensive without sur charges for baguettes."
"we stayed at de lingehoeve for three nights and ate in the restaurant once. ive described it as interesting because it could be very good but lets itself down by things that you think might be easily rectified. for example: (1) our room had no discernible number and no key, so we couldnt lock our door from the outside. once we came back to find the door ajar! (2) they didnt serve breakfast on a monday morning before 9 am! (they did eventually agree to leave us a tray out, and the breakfast itself was good.) (3) there were coffee and tea-making facilities in the room but no coffee or tea! (4) on the sunday, although no one made up our room, they did leave us some clean towels (but left the dirty ones!). (5) the lounge has great antique furniture but none of it was polished, or even dusted. (6) the food, which was all a surprise(!), was well cooked and well presented, but both the tuna and duck were almost raw, which is not to everyones taste and sending back food is always disruptiv "
"bad service, bad info, burned bitterballen .... something so simple and not bring able to do that at a normal (basic) level of quality is reason to reconsider whether you should be open for business, accepting peopleâs money ..."
little atmosphere. nice view of water but its overlooked an industrial sized macdonalds and an ugly bridge. it is accessed via a road running alongside the river which is largely industrial and without char 
"went here for a simple lunch on a sunday. the service was terrible. we ordered snacks, and they came after 40 min. no warning that the wait was going to be long. no sorry for the delay. another 20 min to get cold wraps. the food was ok, but at that point, we just wanted to go. one more thing;the chicken wrap was way too spicy"
unfortunately the location and presentation of the place does not come anywhere near how they run the pla 
"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."
"we had some bites in the afternoon : they were ok and although we had to wait very long, we got a very good service from one pers "
"went here for a 5-course dinner on a saturday evening, we came in early and were welcomed very friendly. the table was nicely setup, clean and spacious setup of the tables and (i love it) an open kitchen. first we were asked if we wanted and appetizer drink (which we agreed on), we took a white port and a cocktail. port tasted good, sweet but not too sweet for a pre-dinner drink. cocktail was tasty also and not too alcoholic. we sat for a good 4 hours, starting with an appetizer (4 actually), bread+oil+butter&sea-salt and then all courses came. some we had to wait for other tables to catch up with us as they prepared most as they could at once. without going to details into the food it was in one word: fabulous. you get really good value for what you pay, for real. but there is a catch, several in fact, which will keep this restaurant from earning (or being eligible to earn) a real dutch michelin guide star. that being: the girls werent all dressed as it should, although they wore the same dress, one had white shoes under them, other black. also the restaurant is shared with the brasserie, and you see (as they share the kitchen) a lot of movement between the two which can be disturbing. also (even before the busy part) one of the girls left leaving essentially one girl (with sometimes help of second one) to serve all tables, resulting in the chef serving dinner for some courses). also the toilets (and paths to them) werent in match what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. not the cleanest, empty (supermarket style) soap and you could just walk out on the backside and into the (dishwasher part) of the kitchen. that area could use a re-style. but, as food is the most important thing in a restaurant, next to the service (which was, dont get me wrong, good) i do give this place a good review, also because the price really values the experience. so, for a great evening out i would highly recommend this place."
the last time we ate in the restaurant it was excellent and we were keen to go ba 
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
we went the day after the flower show to see the floats. it was awful. we had to force our way through the packed street which was like running a gauntlet of sales pitches and open air pubs. when we finally got to the floats they seemed like a tired afterthought and we had to queue to pay eight euros to see the 
"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
nice experience but maybe too many little dishes trying to impress ending up filling the guest too much. some of the dishes had very nice combinations (especially one with salmon and caviar) but i did not make it to the dessert or the cheeses which looked appealing precisely because of the too many amuse-bouche 
"went there a few times, location very nice, interior and setting average to poor! food is so, so, no feeling of genuine cooking more convenience cooking. although the staff is friendly the whole place is average."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."
"good burgers, good beers and finger food in a nice setting decorated with teddy bears. service is a little slow though."
"ive been here several times now, as it is close to work. if you need to get work done, their wifi is very fast and it not too bu "
"good food for a good price. nothing fancy or special but always a good place to have a meal with family or friends. the beeren restaurant in roosendaal is similar in quality to the other beren restaurants. although this one is a bit bigger than most ive visit, more spacious. staff is friendly."
a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"
"i visited the singraven estate with friends. we had a light lunch at this restaurant - pancakes. a very nice setting, with good quality food and reasonable prices."
the restaurant is very nice located in an ols water mill in a beautiful suurounding. the food is not bad but gives the idea that they did not change for at least twenty five years
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."
"i suppose its not easy to run this restaurant. if the weather is good, lots of people come to enjoy the nature and stop by the terras. you can never have enough people at hand to wait all the tabl "
excellent meat...no question about it....you can order it in any weight you might want and they show you the pieces almost like in a butchershop:what you see is indeed what you get 
"as described in several reviews here: this restaurant has been part of conspiracy-theories for years. they actively discourage vaccines, making the whole place unsanitary. there is a lot of propaganda to throw away face masks etc. i used to love to go here in the past, but its become a temple of doom."
"i made a reservation for my mother and a group of her friends for her 75th birthday. the event manager was aware that it was a special day and we specifically requested a table in the restaurant, not one of the separate rooms because they were too large and unsuitable (which the event manager agreed). literally 48 hours in advance, they cancelled the reservation because they had taken on a larger group (funeral). my mother was offered one of the separate rooms which we previously agreed upon were unsuitable for the occassion (too large and too business like). it seems a friendly, organic place, but in the end it is all about the money. do not be fooled."
"the first âcoolâ day in weeks, but just comfortable enough to start our dinner outside on the terrace of this very nice situated restaurant. the âspitskool kroketjesâ had little âspitskoolâ and a lot of ârouxâ in them and were not crunchy, but there was a nice salad on the plate. then my main course. instead of a quiche with some salad on the side what i had expected what i got was a huge plate of salad with the same ingredients i had in my starter salad and on the edge of the plate 6 or 7 cubes of very tasty quiche, but not half enough. i didnât want that whole plate of greens. the proportions in that quiche plate were all wrong. my friend enjoyed her ârundvlees met ratatouilleâ. being the only guests outside they seemed to forget us and we went in to have a coffee. and still no-one asked us whether we enjoyed our meal, whether we would like a dessert. inexperienced personnel? just bad luck? not an evening that triggers you to come back!"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
we arrived at 18.30 hrs and ordered a 5 course surprise me 
"had dinner here with my dad. it was the only place open on a tuesday, so we kind of had to go here. there was a huge group in the front, so we were glad that they had some other tables away from the "
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of â¬17,-. fries cost â¬6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
i had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at the photos on the websit 
i would love to rate the food and drinks but after making a reservation and showing up on time we left after 20 minutes. no service no server no questions. i understand when its busy things go slower but there were at least 6 waiters standing insi 
no idea how the food is. kitchen closes at 20h whilst they mention the restaurant closes at 22h. very confusing and no alternatives close by very dissapointing.
"very poor and slow service.  noisy, crying and running kids. food is not great. this restaurant is even worse than average dutch cafes"
more occupied of speed and sales than of the wellbeing of the customers. nice location but a litte cheap(ish)
"we went there because it was near to our holiday home and there were not many restaurants open that day. place is big but still feels cramped. food was very poor. io had a duck breast without any taste. it was served on an undefined kind of mashed potatoes that had no taste itself, but it was drowned in some gravy, of which i suspect it was just made of granules. next time when im in the neighborhood i will take a longer drive to find a decent for a dinner."
"it is always nice looking at the lake; so, this is a great place to meet othe "
the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at â¬1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."
"its nicely located at a lake. during good weather its very nice to use the terras at this restaurant with a nice view. they offer some good salads, sandwiches and are well known for their sate and french fries. friendly st "
"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldnât be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when itâs busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a âbroodje haringâ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"stopped here via boat for a drink and snack. beautiful view of lake and nice deck, but very slow and inattentive service. at the slow pace of service ran out of time to even order food..."
"together with a friend we had a nice stay, thanks to the great location and the nice, friendly services. the dishes on menu card are very average, probably still going strong (as most restaurants have), not a single surprise. we both chose for the spare ribs (3 half pieces p.p., but more than enough) with two sauces and some pommes frites, but nothing else served with it... the spare ribs were average of quality of meat, but tasteful (we give it the benefit of the doubt), the sauces (bbq and aioli) were good of taste (however do not kiss your partner afterwards...), but probably not fresh made. as a dessert we had the ananas panna cotta and the - old fashioned - dame blanche 2.0, both creative presented and very tasteful. the espresso and the cappuccino afterwards were of good quality."
we have take a lunch every think bad  si long to have the lunch and food are horrible   cÃ©sar salade is  the most horrible i never est  hamburger so bade   forget this place
"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"small restaurant with bad acoustics and really bad chairs. but we proceeded, against our first impression. it took them 35 minutes to get us three plates with âtapasâ. shrimps were still cold and watery from the fridge, the carpaccio was watery, the french frites were raw. the spare ribs in two small bowls were not bad. woth five we received a small bread, two slices per person. we asked to taste the âwineâ and was denied. bad tasting wine at a price of â¬ 6,50 per glass, ridiculous price for wine from the lidle. the salmon was really bad, out of the fridge. we had to pay to much, they wouldnât argue but in the end we received â¬30 back. still we payed way to much for bad prepared food."
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as itâs very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"ok. pizza is sick and soggy and very salty. parmigiana was very disappointed , aubergine was no fried, like a waterð no fresh herbs, without fresh basilicum it is not a real deal.. most of the dinner went to the garbage.. we had a bad tummy in a half hour.. shameâ¦ not anymore "
"we had dinner with friends. i found this to be a nice place, but i found the food to be average. service was good, the limoncello was not as it should (it was made with vodka) and the feeling in the dinning area is that you are in an old restaurant needing a rebuilt to give it a fresh look. you will not be disappointed if you eat there, but you wont be excited either."

"went into this restaurant with my family for a lunch time snack feeling a little hungry and left 1 hour and 15 mins later very hungry. a very busy lunch time all tables occupied with one chef and one waitress, talk about throwing away business left right and centre. cant rate the food because they forgot to write down our order. good idea for the management to call reimers and herman."
"ma moeder is located in the middle of the buzy shopping streets of hoogvliet. on a sunny saturday, which is just inviting for a lunch outside we selected ma moeder as our destination. menu card is not excessive, so with few dishes on the card, we expected good food as well. we selected a dutch delicatese kroket sandwich, however never have i seen such a sad dutch lunch before. kroket was warm and crisp (from the friture) - like we expected, but bun was cold. no butter was served along with the sandwish - only a small tube of mustard, which didnt even cover half the bun. no decoration on plate and anything elsewhich gives you are feel good experience. staff dressed in cargo pants and jeans shirt, so in my eyes not really presentable at a restaurant eith "

boss is a bit loud with a faux friendly attitude. fake. my waitress was fairly welcoming but the one handling the payment was rude. they asked to be paid cash. cheese salad was was nice though. mineral water was good too. overall a disappointing experience.
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice.

we dicide to eat something. after 20min of waiting for service were go somewher else!!! and that was the best decision.  dont go there!   there was bot so many ppl. it wasnt rush hour...

"terrible service. our order wasnât brought completely. bittergarnituur should be 16 pieces but weâve got 12 pieces. the calamaris didnât come at all. after saying our complaints 3 times they told us âi donât knowâ, the other person said: âi will check for youâ and didnât do anything at all. me and my friends will not come here in the future and i recommend you didnât either."
"told them we had 50 minutes to eat, they said no problem. 45 minutes later they told us they canât serve us and they have cancelled our order. skip this and go to san blas instead."
"the roast chicken and rose pinot grigio were nice. a coupe of service matters not so good. but seeing as erwin (at the bar) demonstrated that this place does actually value its customers, iâll just put those down to random bad luck!"
"to the snack counter: one of the worst customer experiences ever. staff was continuously talking to each other. because of that pretty slow service and messing up the orders. the male chef was super charming to his female colleague while chatting. but he was very rude to the customers. these were already talking to each other, upset because of the poor service and even poorer treatment by the chef. horrible!"

"modern beach club with a long history and beautiful terrace with view on the beach. the friendly waitress served us a average caesar salad (iceberg lettuce, chicken, cheese and dressing), we had better lunches this week."
the location is really beautiful at he top of a dune. perfect place for a sundowner. the service is pretty chaotic. there are many people running around but it is not always easy to get ones attention. the first two orders were sold out. my third choice was just ok. cleanliness in times of corona can also be better.
this place definitely needs competition. being in a monopolist position for ages at this location successive managers apparently never felt the need to provide their guests a better service (cheeky staff members) and value for money. enjoy the beach but spend your money elsewhere.
"this restaurant has one option for gluten/lactose intolerant person ( double checked with the manager), chicken breast. got them raw, not only once but twice(after sending them back)! before i was able to take a second zip from my drink the waiter took it. so no food and nothing to drink! i would recommend the beach for your dog but not this restaurant!"
"if its busy, service is slow. if it isnt, the place will be understaffed, and service is slow. its the only game in town, so tough luck."
dropped in for a short coffee break during my bike ride from zaandvort. ordered coffee and pie. didnt get my order for over 15 minutes. when someone came by to ask if everything is okay they told me that my order got screwed up with another table. they promised me i would get it now very soon. after again way over 10 minutes i was just about to leave when it finally arrived. now they said it had been ordered for the wrong table number. didnt seem very apologetic. pie was okay but nothing to write home about. coffee was too small for the price.

t eindpunt is a good place to eat after a day at the beach. staff is friendly. food is ok and served quickly. pricing is average. dining outside is fine but be aware of the direction of the wind otherwise your fun will be ruined.
nice restaurant we have been going to for years. menu us ok and food quality is good. unfortunately not really good options for vegetarians nor for vegans. that is a bit if a shame as more and more people follow such diets.
"played here as a child, hiding in the hollow tree (now a bronze replica) and spending energy running up and down the dunes. now apple-speck pancakes for old times sake."
"visited middle of the heatwave and charged 3 euro for a jug of tap water - why you ask (?) because i was told the germans always ask for it - so what, itâs water from a tap and i had two thirsty children - nope, still 3 euros. quite unbelievable - have never paid for tap water anywhere. "
"if you are extremely hungry and looking for just a quick meal with nice pancakes and you are without children, you should no go here "
we were a party of 6 looking to eat a snack . . . . pancak 
"the location is good for a quick bite when you are heading to or from zandvoort. we tried several pancakes and i must say that their pancakes are average. some pancakes were ok but some were not that tasty, it misses something. but its good for a quick snack. "
"the location is great. it takes, however, very long to order and even longer to get what you ordered. the lemonade is good, the food is just ok, but not if you take the expensive prices into consideration. there are better places around."
"we wanted to eat something on the beach in bloomingdale and spontaneously went to the beach club. we were allowed to choose a table and from then on it was over with the service. everyone who came after us was served except us. only when my wife went to serve did someone come to our table. we were served reluctantly, probably because we are germans. no recommendation!!!"
"the food itself tasted fine, actually it was such a small portion that we need to go to the fastfood place around the corner to eat something else. unfortunately the prices say something different. "
"we went for drinks on a sunny busy afternoon. we were with 3 people and 3 more were joining quickly after, so we asked a 6 persons table. this was not possible because they only give tables to âfull groupsâ?! when our 3 friends arrived there was a still a table next to us available so we asked personnel if our friends could sit there, which was agreed to. when they wanted to sit down, it was suddenly not possible anymore, because we were not a âfull groupâ from te beginning?! very rude and we left. 1 star is for the pornstar martini which was good. however i will drink my martini somewhere else next time. not recommend "
evening visit. noisy. busy. food average. service slow.   good location on beach and for families during the day might be better.   no return for me.
we were there on a day the weather was not very sunny and likely to rain so there were not many people. the service was quick and ok. prices are as expected near beach rather high.
"service was appalling. once we had eaten, plates were not cleared. neither were the tables around us. by the time we paid the table next to us had been piled with half eaten smelly leftovers for an hour. it actually made me sick. even specifically asking a waitress to clear our plates failed, she just took another tableâs money and left never to retur "
"i waited about 20 min before asking the hostess how can i order. she said i had to wait for a waiter to come for my order. well, ok house rules. waited another 15mins counting how many waiters pass by me and on â5â i just left. "
what an amazing view. and there it stop 
i found this place over-priced to say the least and we only had dri 
"we asked for an english menu, which came after 15 minutes; the waitress was rude, arrogant and helpless, she forgot the beer and she insisted in saying i didnt order ir, so she borought after 10 minutes. food is average, do not order cocktails cos they are not worth at all. service is the worst experienced in the latest years. "
"great location, nice loungy music and a beautiful setting, that is about it for the positives. pretty much everything else was wrong. no one came to serve our table, we waited, runners will not serve tables (understandable) but waiter never came. flagged one down for drinks and dinner. it was 17:45, kitchen opened at 18:00 so we could not order but also menu was not offered. took our drinks order, attitude was snotty & arrogant. drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, one of the pepsi bottles was used?! about 1/3 of the bottle was empty, we needed to inform the staff. no apologies and it took another 5 mins for replacement. for the rest, dirty tables are left dirty, menus are not cleaned away, ashtrays not cleaned. loungers are at an extra â¬ but even these guests had to go to the bar to order. i saw rubbish on tables and floors that was not cleaned, broken glass that was not cleared etc. staff does not seem to be bothered to serve or work in general. softdrinks at â¬3,50 for 0,2l are expensive, due to location but we left without ordering food or asking for the menu. no comment from the waiter when we did not ask for a menu or order food but he was even expecting a tip which was the icing on the cake. would not recommend, place needs training and proper management. wish i had checked reviews before we sat down."
"from opening the door there was an immediate feeling that we had entered the twilight zone, but as good masochists we stayed to see what this place can offer. the staff was running around in a zombie like state, and nobody noticed us. finally we managed to draw the attention of one of them, and were pointed at an available table. everything that we ordered was disgusting and not as described on the menu. bruschetta with burrata. never seen anything like th "
the price for a burger is extremely high and it doesnt even contain what it said in menu. the staff is kind of unfriendly and expect long waiting times to be serve 
"keep looking for a top spot and move up north 20-50 km, this is one of those places people go to be seen but nothing special and you pay a tough price..."
there is one thing i have to admit: this place has a good location other than that i would not suggest this place at all. first of all we waited around 20min until the waiter came to take the order. then we specifically had to ask to clean the table of the previous guests. once i had ordered a burger of 17â¬ i receive have of a portion of fries. this is disappointed me in service and i have to say its not worth my money at all. this was my first and absolute last time. 
bloomingdale beach club is famous and a pace to be or a hot spot or whatev 
"since the sun came out again today we decided to go for a walk with the dog in the late afternoon and chilled out afterwards @ bloomingedales with some nice but rather expensive drinks followed by a dinner. our friend had a steak dinner, my hubby the tuna and i had the chicken sateh. it all tasted good and the good thing is that you can take your dog with you!"
"avoid this place at all costs. the setting is great which makes it tempting, but it isnt worth it. the staff were disinterested and - at times - openly rude. our order was completely messed up, the food is expensive and although we didnt let this place ruin a lovely day out, we certainly would never return. "
dropped by for some dinner and cocktails. it was pretty difficult to place an order since the staff wasnt paying any attention. after asking three runners to get somebody to take our order we finally met a waitress at our table. roughly 20 minuten had passer and the place was only occupied for  
very bad experience. slow waiters and very long waiting time for drinks and food.   cheesy waiters.  no go for this first sunny day of the year.
"we went for a lunch at the wellknown beachclub and were astonished about (lack of) service and quality, something we are not used of this beachcl "
"in this place i had possibly the worst burger (and meal!) ever! in my opinion overpriced, we paid 48â¬ for two burgers and a kid menu. the burger was small and not good quality and some of the fries were burnt. absolutely not recommended."
"i ate at stach march 2015 during a business trip. the staff was friendly, service quick and the salad was very good. a very dutch restaurant with clean modern lines, lots of windows and black frames. very relaxing. a cool thing is that they have a little grocery with take away lunches, sandwiches, curry, soups, and lots of chocolate!!!!"
"this is an atmospheric pub/restaurant, a nice place to visit, some of the food is great, some is not, it simply depends on what you get. but still worth a look!"
"two of us visited here, i had a mixed grill, which was excellent, a perfectly cooked selection of steak, pork, chicken and lamb, all very nicely presented and with good servi "
they are not friendly. iâll never come here again. the way they treat their staff. ð¤® a big fat no!!
we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff donât seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend. 
food was good and ok but very unkind waiter also to my child of 4 years. very unsociable and not friendl.
"we came for dinner with 4 people on a wednesday night. we had to wait a long time before we could order and after 40 minutes bread still had not arrived, we had to go and search for the waitress. when the bread did arrived it came at the same time as our starters. there was a large group of people having dinner in another room and the staff was busy. we also had to wait very long for the main courses and to get another drink, another search for the staff was needed. no excuus from the staff nothing, we didnt feel welcome here! the food was nothing special, nice fish but no vegetables were served only a bowl of salad to share with 4 people and some fries."
"probably the best fast food/ fries place in the area. this is our regular supplier for a once-a-week fast food lunch with team. quality is consistent. on bank holidays, or on moment when you would expect the place to be open, then .... it is closed. and they can afford to do this, as theres no real competition in the are "
"nice terrace on eersels market square , great ambiance, good seati "
"we enjoyed the ice cream very much but sadly as the card machine didnât seem to accept international cards of any kind (pre-paid, debit, credit) which had worked elsewhere, we had to sit around with small children for over an hour while one member of our party travelled to the next town to withdraw cash. there should be a sign advising this."
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.
"it was quiet in the restaurant. i ordered soup and sandwiches. the sweet potato soup was tasteless. when asked by the staff if the food was good, i told them i didnt like the soup at all. no reaction or comment whatsoever. they didnt seem to care at al "
"expectations were high but unfortumately the restaurant did not met the expectations. the staff was good but very informal. the wait for the food was very long. the bar was occupied by non-restaurant guests so it was like you had dinner in a bar in stead of a restaurant. the food was good, the presentation was good but the portions are small. price range quite high. lets say an average of â¬ 35 per couvert. a lot of loud people where it seems that everyone knows everyone. an incrowd place and not very inviting for outsiders. an end result with a 6. just ok."
"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is okÃ© except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"after three weeks vacation in the united states and got the american fries, this place was really my first destination after landing at schipol airport. hmmmâ¦."
"not what youâd call service with a smile. lady was particularly grumpy! chips were good, very handy quick lunch for us. cheese sauce dreadful, curry sauce delicious, way too much ketchup all over the top of the chips."
a proper dutch snack when having been abroad too long. i think the quality is just average and i always have to get used to dutch assertiveness again â¦ but who cares â¦ give me my kroket!
"this review is for vlaamse frites in reguliersbreestraat, amsterdam as i cannot find it in their listing. their fries are fresh and taste awesome. lots of sauces to choose from. i loved them with mayonnaise. actually, its too much mayonnaise but its fine, you are anyways gonna burn it walking in amsterdam!"
the probleem of this place is not opofferen it is good or b 
"baguette with salmon, there are better and tastier; overpriced. cup of coffee, only brown coloured hot water.  cognition: rip-off."
"the cheese roll, yoghurt and apple pie were good to eat but the young person serving me had more interest in her friend than trying to serve me. i appeared to be a problem asking for english breakfast tea and hadnt been replenished on the serving table. she may be identified as 603408 eden "
avoid this place at all costs.  paid in pounds and was given less euros. a bill for 15cent euro ended up paying 3 euros.  the manager couldnt help but got very furious when i showed them their reviews
avoid this place as i was double charged for my food! i was in a hurry and tapped my credit card and when i got back to the states - a sandwich and banana should of cost me $12 ended up getting charged twice and see 2 charges of $12. evidenced in my credit card statement. 
"we got a couple of beers and sandwiches which were heated quickly, but there were many disgruntled customers waiting for burgers and other food for at least half an hour and even one guy just waiting for a beer. several employees, most just standing around. appeared to be very poorly and inefficiently managed, service was a little snipp "
"waited over 20mins for my food to arrive. i went up and asked how long, a very rude member of staff told me just to wait. then he tried to serve me food that had been sat there for 10mins, which i refused. i had ordered fish and chips. it looked nothing like it!!!! then suddenly another appeared after i refused the first one. i was not confident that that was made fresh so again refused this one. the extremely rude server made a comment, in dutch, so couldnât understand it. so i got a refun "
"â¬7.10 for a can of beer (a âbottle depositâ of â¬0.15 charged, even though it was a can) and â¬8.45 for a ham sandwich. ridiculous prices."
"i expect an airport restaurant to be ridiculously overpriced. this place didnt disappoint in that regard: 16 euros for a burger and over 4 euros for a coke. however, theres no excuse for bad service and an equally bad response. before i ordered, i talked to the guy who was doing the cooking. i wanted an absolutely plain burger. no condiments. no seasoning. just the plain meat. we talked for a full minute and he assured me he would make a plain burger for me. i waited about 15 minutes and then the burger was ready. when i walked up to the counter, i immediately saw that the burger was not plain. it had lettuce, tomato and mayo on it. the cook yelled over that it was plain but then came over and saw for himself that it was not. instead of offering to prepare a new plate, he started scraping the condiments off and put the patty on a new roll. hard to do this with mayo on the patty! they have their ketchup in small plastic containers. i asked the woman behind the counter for an extra container so i could kill any leftover taste of the mayo and she refused, saying we charge extra for those! she had zero customer handling skills, especially in light of their mistake. i see from other reviewers that poor customer service seems to be a recurring theme here. i dont expect that the restaurant will improve because of my review nor do i expect others to avoid this place because of it. but bad service should be called out."
"10 years living in the netherlands and this airport (inside) is still a overpriced, rodent invested, lacking in customer service, mismanged, false advertised and uncompetive peice of crud. hms host and their staff and the worst i think not a single one lnows haccp, the food choices are bread or bread. plus the staff are treated like dirt hence the reason nobody wants to work here."
"poor cappucino, is was too hot and bad taste. one of the  table or bar was uncleaned. there was empy dish. service was slow."
"like most airports drinks are relatively expensive, likewise snack food. area can be quite busy and as some people in a rush very little attention to social distancing.  apple pie is quite nice and tasty."
ordered burger with coke tom 30 minutes before the burger was finished  fries were ok but the burger was red inside complaining did not work they said that was there way to do it never again there
their staff was not giving any attention to customers. unpolitisch and rough. questions were not answered properly. the tables were inaccessible and no allowance to rest! notably in a restaurant.
"drinks in harvest market 654 look overpriced. 4.95 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. the seats next to us were not cleaned with dirts all over the place. the cashier was grumpy. what a place, but seemingly the last one at the end of the terminal."
"we went to hms host schiphol airport during departure from amsterdam in the last trip before quarantine, just few days before it start "
"after arriving at 07:30 on a flight from prague into the schiphol airport, we were starving for breakfast. the hms host schiphol restaurant looked inviting. we ordered a 3 egg omelet and 3 fried eggs, both came with a side of bacon. my partner ordered a diet coke as well. average typical airport food quality and service. total cost for two: â¬22.75."
"well, we never come here with big expectations and so we dont get disappointed. average quality with sometimes slow service. but at least expensive. :)"
i had a great coffee and opted for a beef burger as i was really hungry. i was glad i did not order the scrambled eggs as other customers had because they looked overcooked and unappealing. i thought 16 euro for a burger and coffee was quite expensive but i looked around and there was not much else available.
"due to an unexpected layover we needed to get some lunch. we chose hms host because it seemed rather busy and was on our way. we learned it was not the greatest choice. neither the food nor the service were very good. however, sometimes necessity out weighs selectivity. i must say there was plenty and we were ready to move forward."
"while waiting for a connecting flight we dropped in past this cafe for a quick snack,  and  the coffee and apple cake was very tasty."
"i stopped here before getting on my flight. i got the americano coffee and yogurt with some mango bits mixed in. the yogurt tasted very fresh and healthy. coffee was strong, but i left it in the bathroom and by the time i realized that and came back, the bathroom attendant had already disposed of it. oh well!"
ordered a vegan cup just 4.50 but charged me a salad cost 7. 
"in transit at schipol airport and desperate for a hot drink, we came to hms host and ordered two hot chocolates. they were small, no more than room temperature and cost 7.30 euros. a complete waste of money. avoid."
for airport bar this was not exceptional but functional and service was quick and good drinks were of good quality and price not overly expensive
"only ate here because it was close to my departure gate. i wouldnât have chosen it if there had been other options. the fish sandwich wasnât very good, and the bacon and egg crepe was passable. helpful and friendly cashiers, though."
"naturally fast food was extremely slow and the staff was incompetent. the food we got served was cold. when we took a tray he said we took the wrong tray, meaning he wanted to put the receipt on our tray instead of a new tray he could just have grabbed. when watching customers weâre served coffee in to go cups but there were no kids that fit the larger cups. all in all...not great"
i did not realize that this was a starbucks when i first went but the service was good and the coffee was too.
"ordered gourmet extra cheese burger and cappuccino. run by kids, not very clean, initially they gave my burger away, then put a sheet of cheese on the other guyys burger and gave me his. coffee was half full, salad turning and coleslaw looked and tasted half dead. apart from that it was what i expected from airport food. gives street food a bad name."
"crazy prices! not so much choice in the mornings and people working there not friendly at all, so tired not even see you standing in front of them."
"used a kebab place in the airport... well where do we start... we wanted burger, they had no burgers, wanted a chicken burger.. none of them either. "
avoid this spot if you are having lun 
"was ok for the momento, just eat and  "
the cost of 2 very pricey lattes was 6.80 euros almost 10 canadian dollars served in paper cups and to top it all off they didnt have any lids.
"we ate lunch for satay chicken 20,25 â¬ and burger 20,75 â¬. awfull mess. never again. quality - price is poor."
"after standing in front of the restaurant waiting to get seated an employee told me to just pick a seat...in doing so another employee comes and says that i need to queue up for being seated. after telling him, that this was exactly what i did, he insisted to get me back to the start of the line. asking for his supervisor i needed to wait for quite some time and then explaining the manager what happened she was very unprofessional and noch customer oriented, telling me that she hears two different stories (from her employee and me) and does not want to find out what really happened. neither she or the employee who sent me back to the row expressed any sorry for the inconveniences....and this even although there were other people that had seen the whole story. i finally got a seat and some food (which was ok but not at all really good or even outstanding) but now at 20:00 they stopped serving food (as i wanted tom order a dessert) although the restaurant does not close before 21: "
i really like food and wine here but it is not the first time people who work there donât know what customer service is! for place like schipol with such prices you have to invest in training for people who work for you so they know how to treat clients! especially if they dont speak dutch!!! very very dissappointing!!!!
ordered the bratwurst and fries and a lipton lemon drink.  the bratwurst was good enough to fill me up and keep going. choice of sauces at your disposal.  nothing too exciting but ok for a quick bite of cooked or cold meals.
"please doublecheck the products before buying. fresh juice in their minds is a pre-produced concentrated crap thay they sell for 5.90 a glass.  do not visit, go to another place, there are plenty on schiphol."
"i visited the hmshost heineken bar 152 at the top of the d gates whilst returning from marseille to bristol via amsterdam last week. i had time for a quick beer on the way from c gates to d gates and noticed the familiar green of a heineken bar. when it is a bar dedicated to a particular beer, you expect the best because there is no choice, only heineken. ok, so its not my favourite beer and , in my opinion, it ranks at the lower end of the scale against such beers as moretti, estrella damm, kirin ichiban and six point, however i do not object to a nice pint of heineken when time is short and it is the only bar in sight. it was not busy and i sat at the bar where two young girls were working. as soon as i sat down, one disappeared and the other began stacking glasses making sure that i had noticed her intentional ignorance. she made it clear that she had issued a challenge and, as i was short of time, i took up her challenge and said excuse me, can i have a pint of heineken please?. she looked around with an expression of disgust and replied when i have finished this. after a short time, she pulled a pint of heineken and requested five and a half euros. i paid the extortionate rate and took a gulp of the beer which was totally without gas. it was cold, granted, and it tasted like heineken, but it was flat. i called her back and explained that the beer was unsatisfactory. at this point, she said that she would provide a replacement. she pulled another beer and looked upon it noting that this one was lacking in fizz also. a male member of staff was now in attendance and he also pulled a half of the beer and gazed wistfully into the glass. they both then took the beer (her with the new pint and him with the half pint) into the back office to show yet another member of staff. i could see into this office from the bar and i observed many examinations of the glasses and much discussion therein. after around five minutes, i caught the eye of the male member of staff who had yet to venture from the back office and tapped my watch indicating that i needed a resolution to the matter before my flight departed. i was ignored and the original girl who had vacated the bar upon my initial arrival now re-appeared behind the bar. i said to her just give me a refund and i will be on my way to which she replied we cannot give a refund. i indicated to her that the beer was undrinkable. at this point i was starting to get a little agitated and within ten seconds, the male member of staff who had pulled a half of the beer to examine appeared from the back office, opened the till and gave me five and a half euros and apologised profusely about the matter. i was on my way again and i purchased a can of heineken at the shop at the gate (admittedly at the ridiculous price of five and a half euros). we all know that airport prices are a rip off but please, if youre going to rip us off, at least make sure that the product is fit for consumption!!!!!"
"this place is nothing really special, but it sure comes in handy when you need a quick bite to eat while waiting in schipol airport for your plane to depart. my wife had a yoghurt parfait type of thing, i had a caprese sandwich, and we each had sparking water. the food was just okay, the prices were slightly high (but that is expected in an airport), and the service was fast."
we had quick lunch before our flight back to ho 
this has got to be the slowest burger king i have ever visited. fifth person in the queue and waited 20 minutes to be served to get a microwaved childrens cheeseburger.
my wife and i wished to have something different rather than the usual fast food offering in airports so chose kebaya as it looked nice and the menu on the board was very appealing. the drinks were a bit pricey but its an airport restaurant! we ordered our meal using a state of the art  tablet device so thought we were at somewhere speci 
"visited their starbucks kiosk c - pier and it was efficient, good and costly but a very typical starbucks.  if youre looking for something to hold you over before a flight this works fine."
"terrible, expensive junk food. two hotdogs, one petite diet coke, 21.65 euros. rude waitress. yuck. we were in a hurry due to closely timed connections, but this experience in the airport was beyond awful. cold hotdogs. stale buns. rude service. next time, if were rushed, well skip eating anything here!"
+ smoking room next to cafe. - cold hotdogs for 8.95 eur but its ok to killing time. heineken draft beer - 5.55 eur
worst service i have ever experienced the waitress was so rude. as we had not finished our bottle of wine we asked for a cork so we could take it with us. the waitress responded with iâm busy ask at the bar. we asked her again as didnât know where the bar was and was in a rush for our flight with this the same waitress told us we were rude and started to argue with us. i will never set foot in here ever again 
we arrive 10 minutes before they close and we saw 4 burgers available but they hid them to eat themselves..the workers prefer steal the products than sell burgers for 7â¬. 0% natural place
we were waiting for a noon flight but had not had breakfast. we wanted to sit down so there was a counter to do s 
enjoyed a decent cup of coffee while waiting for my flight to glasgow but should have refrained from ordering a warm sausage roll which was large and rather stodgy.  7:40 euros was expensive for very average food.
"well, its not really a special restaurant. they have enough choice from sandwiches to warm food. snacks, salads, soup etc. we got 2 cheese rolls, a small bowl salade, fries and a bowl soup and..... it cost us â¬ 29,95. its expensive."
"thank you travel gods for airport cafÃ©s having real cups! the coffee tastes better and there is less waste. there must be a fb group dedicated to helping fellow travellers steal clear of styrofoam, paper cups with paper taste and pesky plastic lids!"
i has the looks of a fine asian restaurant at the airport but the food sadly is so insipid and tasteless and you pay a high price. i had miso ramen which was the worst i have ever had!
great location for a pre flight snack drink. clean tidy fast but be prepared for hefty charges as in the whole airport.
"the food is nice, but the prices are way to high. especially compared with the portions you get. there are better options."
"we ate here while waiting for our delayed plane. the lasagne was just fine, the pizza was ok, the beer was as it should be and the smoothie was ok as was the coffee."
"expensive, but tasty salmon sandwich ... in line with most airport prices. good location though, right in the middle of the terminal and large seating area. the view outside is also quite nice."
large assortiment in food and beverages   warm or cold. nice coffee.  good place to grab a snack just before your flight.  expansie but in line with other airports.  great view and terrace.
vast choices of restaurants at schiphol and we thought we would try the japanese restaura 
"good place to stop for a drink or snack, with views of planes and part of the runway, while you wait for your flight. not too expensive."
"everyone knows that eating outlets in airports are not cheap as they have a captive market, but given all the delicious food we had encountered on our trip, we at least expected reasoanble quality. there are a number of places to choose to eat and we would definitely not eat here again or recommend it when next passing through. the choice was very limited for drinks and food. my daughter and i ended up having very soggy and uninspiring, tepid pizza margharita with a beer, a diet coke and a chocolate milk. total cost 26 euros. my husband had an adequate burger from the counter next to this which was also overpriced. choose somewhere else to eat at the airport. it is a huge place and there are other choices."
"the coffee was good, but the ham and cheese sandwich was skimpy a banana and chocolate pastry was filling but not  wonderful"
stopped by to grab a quick bite before a trip. i had a sausage roll and a cheese roll. the cheese roll was quite good and much better than the sausage roll. the staff had a lot of customers going crazy and they handled our orders perfectly. excellent service. thank you!
i try to eat plenty of sashimi and sushi when travelling due to it being a healthy option. this airport location had a good choice and to be fair the food was good and fresh. service was good and you order you own dishes off a tablet menu with pictures of each dish which is a good way to see what you are getting. you can make worse choices in an airport. would return.
went to two of the hmshost opperated takeaway places. a breadstall and a grab&f 
place to stop by to have a sandwich and a drink before or after you take a flight or the train. ample sitting space. reasonable price.
"busy place with typical fast food you can find at the airport. nothing was too exquisite. sandwiches were, actually, awful, either empty or filled with chewy mea "
stopped in to get something to eat on the plane. options were limited but i got a bagel with cream cheese. probably got the wrong thing - was the worst bagel ive ever had.
nice place a bit hidden in the schiphol airport people are nice the food is good i got the two steaks forgot the name the one at 23â¬ it was too cooked for my taste the fully loaded burger is really big and good
"we blinked when we stopped here for a light lunch before our flight to the uk because we honestly thought wed been magically transported back to the wilds of north america where cardboard, tasteless take out food is the norm for a captive audience with no other options. the pizza was cold and lifeless as was the service. do yourself a favour and bypass this establishment."
food is very mediocre but they get away with it due to the captive audien 
had a piece of meat that was  cooked ok but the portion was not really so pleanty. the cost is not comparable to the quantity  probably  because its an airport.  it should be a bit more cost effettive.   the personel is friendly and quick.
once you have ordered food you might as well take the flight and come back at your leisure to collect your order. the staff are in no hurry whatsoever and will do everything to make your experience as lazy as thier service is. go to another place as there are plenty others at the airport. 
we were waiting for a connection flight and grabbed a sandwich and beer. the beer was offered extra cold and was very refreshing.  the sandwich was average but filled a gap. suggest this was better than others which looked worse!
had a terrible meal here that was not good at all. food was not warm and the prices where high.  will grab a snickers in the kiosk next time i feel hungry here.
nothing special but good enough. staff are friendly. note this is the kitchen near the casino. had omelette. did the job
"we had a slice of pizza, bread with smoked salmon, daysoup, 2 cofefe and 1 medium diet coke. 30 euros, do i need to say mo "
expensive for a cappuccino from an automatic machine (no moka) and a watered down powder made orange juice. the muffin was ok.
"this looked a lovely place inside the airport at the harvest market. however, it was so disappointing. 5 minutes before 11am they wouldnt serve a full english breakfast (even though service was until 11). i went for a cheese and chicken panini which was all dried up. the danish pastry was also dry. poor service and sub-standard food. could have been so much better. awful food and poor service. maybe it was a bad day? but it was only 10.55 am!"
"the food or drink you get is ok for a quick bite, but you will not be given a surprised by a huge quality. i have had better quality on other airports."
"my credit card bill shows hms host as charging for our meal, but reading the other reviews some clearly refer to landside outlets, other to airside outlets. this review covers the dutch kitchen, airside in the non-schengen part of the schiphol airport (so i think between piers e and f, near where the old rijksmuseum outlet used to b "
"this is very calm place away from the crowds--to reach it you must go up some stairs away from the rest of the airport. it is next to an outdoor area that gives you a nice view of the airport. we used it to kill some time while waiting for our flight. the service was very friendly and they have a nice variety of items ranging from cold sandwiches, paninis, lots of desserts, coffees and a wide variety of drinks including beer. the variety extends even beyond what ive listed. my chicken teriyaki sandwich was pretty good but ive had better. my wife loved what she got. prices were very reasonable by u.s. airport standards. all in all, this is a pretty nice place with, again, very friendly service."
"food is ok but the staff are slow in serving/preparing the food behind the counters, apart from the pizza section where they were speedy. there were long queues for most food counters i am sure because of the slow service. anyway, its fine for a pre-travel meal. "
"not good. a toasted panini with uncooked coronation chicken. they replaced it, but the replacement (bacon and egg) was oosing in fat. an all-round bad experience."
"right opposite the arrivals gates at terminal 3, this is a useful spot to wait for arriving friends/family. whilst waiting we had a cappuccino and a latte. both were very good and each was 3.75 e. didnt have any food but they seem to have the usual dutch snack foods."
coffee weak.  apple pie freezing cold.  moarella baguette tasteless.  insufficient staff to clear tables  what has happened to catering at airports?
"terrible, we arrived, sat down by the bar, waited for 10 minutes and no one came to take our order. barman was just in front of us and did not acknowledge us at all."
"it is nice and the view was ok, but i think you could turn the music down a little! the food was a solid 9/10 and the water was perfect temperature!!!!!!! but i think that a drinks menu would be good.the chicken burger was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the restaurant was very bright and happy!!! overall 4. "
the worst experience ive had in an airport restaura 
"the menu was reduced to 3 itemsâ¦ count them, 3. because a âmachineâ was broken. also, despite having menus in the comfy area, you couldnât order there and we had to move seats. ridiculous place."
"ordered few beers and top range burger, burger was ok, nothing special but not too bad eithe "
"decent food, crap service, charged extra for sauces, fries and what knows what although they were included in the menu. small amounts, but the feeling of being scammed is there"
"wrong order, wrong check and nobody care about the mistake. also its not easy to get the waitress to order second drink â¹ï¸â¹ï¸â¹ï¸"
"today on 29october the waiter was friendly,a time ago i meet some waiter there and he was realy not like his j "
we sat at a table waiting for service for ten minutes. it was not busy and the staff never acknowledged us so we ended up leaving.
we had a couple hours before our flight and decided to have some drinks. the restaurant wasnt very busy and it seemed there were only two staff workin 
"absolutely awful. slow service, rubbish food and extremely over priced. â¬7.30 for a bottle of still water. then added money for ketchup and mayo that we didnât ask for. â¬23 for a burger thatâs not even good. avoid."
honestly horrible !!! service absolutely bad! cuttlery thrown literally at our face! quality black angus burger patty? not even in dreams. the meat taste like frozen frikandelle from a city fair truck! nothing to eat or drink there. definitely not worth the overpricing!
"i ordered drinks about 4 times and nobody brought the drinks so iâve finished my meal without any drink, they brought just one drink of the four iâve ordered at the end when i didnât even want it anymore. the waitress didnât even show up so it was very difficult to talk with her. so the service is nothing good for me."
the waitress did an appalling job of taking our ordering managed to get most of wrong. the food was delivered to the table and they almost flung it at us and went before we could say it was wrong at this point we were hungry and with our flight time getting closer we eat what we were give 
unbelievable slow service (20+ min just to be able to place order). way understaffed. the staff that was there didnt seem to care about customers having to wait.
"we got our drinks and food quickly, but the server never cane back. we needed refills of water and more drinks, but our server disappeared and nobody else came. we were charged for eight small containers of ketchup and mayonnaise that we didnât order! we had to search for someone to pay and was then informed that they donât divide checks. that is fine, but i have never eaten anywhere that didnât communicate that before guests order their food. then when i checked my american express statement, they charged me twice! thank goodness, american express sorted this out for me! lesson learned- i should have checked the reviews before eating here."
"horrible service.  three tables ordered and served drinks before we decided to leave.  had plenty of time between flights, but 20 minutes if being ignored is unconscionable."
the common theme of the restaurant is food roulette. the drinks came out at a lighting pace to quench the thirst. the food however was a different story. when the food finally arrived the order was wrong and missing items. turns out the chef canât read an order and nor can the server put half of it into the til 
"good choice of dishes,  not the usual airport selection. food freshly cooked in front of you. good service.  downside,  tables not cleaned between customers"
just appalling. food inedible. i think customers are expected to clear their own tables...see pictures... really was awful. if you want a burger go to mcdonalds...twice as nice and half the price ð
"i thought id get a lunch time snack here last week. i paid for it, but after half an hour it still hadnt turned up and i had a plane to catch. couldnt get a refund because the person whod taken the order had gone, and when they offered to give me a take away and promised they were bagging it up, even then after five minutes i was standing at the bar wondering where it was and just had to give up and get my pla "
"we had to search the restaurant for a table, once we finally found a table we had to then go and find menus as there were only kitchen staff and one lady behind the bar. whilst sitting we saw 5 mice running around the restaurant and under the food cabinets, so we very quickly left!"
"was confusing as we sat down and didnt get served. eventually went to bar and they said we are sitting in the wrong area and cant help, went to kitchen counter and was told quite abruptly to sit and wait for someone to come..when i said we had been waiting for a while they explained that our seating was outside of their restaurant. we had their restaurants menu on our table which had caused the confusion. thats all fine but then make a polite suggestion that we sit in the designated area to be served...not just say sorry cant do it! ð when we did move we still had to wait a while for the one poor waitress to come to us, and the miserable kitchen staff just snapped at her. terrible customer service... "
"horrible and angry service, not enough staff making the ones that are there to be angry. on google it says that they close at 21:30 however at 20:30 they send us away. when we asked if drinks were still possible they said no. even though the bar is still open. so we go to the bar and they are discussing their own times for closing even though its busy there. so we get served at the bar and want to find a seat. we pick a table where others are sitting as well. and they send us away even though other people are still sitting there with their drin "
"i ordered a rib eye but they told me it is not available. few minutes later another man ordered rib eye no problem. wtf? so i ordered burger, it was pre-heated and made probably few hours ago, came very dry and taste less. this place is not recommended."
very rude cook was very sarcaric. then completely ignored by the waiter.gave up after 15 mins and went to another restraunt.tbe place wasnt even that busy.
ordered the classic burger and a beer whilst waiting for the flig 
"absolutely terrible service from the bar staff, arrived at 8:40 told closed but then continued to serve others, swore at customer when asked why , i work for heineken and pass through here often , i was ashamed that they sell our brand if this is the serve they provide."
"i travel a fair bit for workâ¦ i donât think iâve ever had service poor enough to inspire me to write a review before. i never got the drink i ordered, the cesar salad was not very good, and service was inattentive even by european standards. think you have plenty of time to grab a bite to eat and still make your flight? maybe not if you eat here!"
"sat down with my partner and was approached by the old man waiter claiming i have to buy food to sit down and not just a drink, he got very aggressive when i told him no one else was eating around us only drinki "
"the waiter / manager was incredibly rude constantly albeit being the only server at the very busy restaurant- no excuse for complaining heavily to us when we asked for some ketchup that we didnt order it with the meal, then the drinks order was wrong and we was very polite at asking for the correct order.. again huge lamentation and when we arrived to ask for a table was just dismissed - it is very expensive but this is hands nmdown the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life! avoid!!"
"absolutely shocking service, waiters very rude. forgot parts of the order and then took a long time to rectify their mistake. also seen them being very rude to people who simply wanted to order. i could understand if the place was very busy but it honestly wasnât that busy with many empty seats."
"i had the vegan seaweed burger. super tasty i have to say but not worth 21 euro. i know airport restaurants have hefty rents to pay, but still. to add further insult you get charged extra for ketchup and mayonnaise even though when youâre offered them itâs not obvious youâre being âupsoldâ. also, they wonât give you a glass of delicious dutch tap water. oh no, you have to buy a bottle of imported french water - 4.25euro for 25cl."
was told to pay later! barman put extra drink on! and said we ordered â¬14!  gave cash bk when caugh!!
"quite a comical visit to be honest. came at a time when airport was fairly busy. the restaurant had only one waiter, a few barman and a couple of chefs. the waiter was shouting to everyone who walked in the place this area is closed and was generally storming around very moody. we had asked a few questions on the menu and got back very rude and sarcastic replies from the einstein lookalike. icing on the cake was, our burger finally arrived which was a beef burger rather than the chicken burger we ordered. as we pointed this out the waiters response was... ok my mistake i will give this away and refund you thanks bye after we had just waited 30 minutes for the burger to be prepared."
"came here during a weeknight around 5pm, sat for 30 minutes before anyone even came to serve. despite asking for a menu / drink on 3 occassions. eventually they came over and asked if i had been served yet.. then advised me not to order as they were having technical issue "
"just got 2 coffees from that place, found out i had to pay â¬13 for those 2 âdirty watersâ as coffee is a big word. awful! a legal robbery"
"unfriendly people legit so unhappy and rude, wanted to order something and the man with the grey hair is just unfriendly and rude"
"not the easiest review to do. the food, we both had the chicken burger, was nice, dressings were fresh and wasnt greasy at all, a good 3/5 however the service was shocki "
"last time i was here i ate in the jamie oliver restaurant. never again.....that was dire. this was so much better. the service was speedy, the food good, usual airport prices but thats to be expected. would choose this again when im next in schipol in july."
"we had a completely incompetent waitress. despite being very clear when we ordered, our food had to be brought back twice and it still ended up being wrong. she gave us the completely wrong burgers that were more expensive than the ones we originally ordered, instead of having them been taken back for a third time we just ate them and they said they would only charge for the ones we originally ordered. she then tried to charge for the more expensive ones again when we went to pay, if we hadnt been so thorough she may have gotten away with charging us more. she didnt apologise for any of the mistakes at all and at one point said we had ordered something that we didnt order. it was hard to enjoy the food or find any appealing feature when the service was that bad."
"the 1st time i went was february 2022, somehow they lost my orded so i had to wait ages. this time i ordered and waited for ages anyway, the only good thing is that i wasnt the only one waiting. luckily my plan was delayed."
"the waiter was just straight up rude and racist , didnât see him give the same treatment to other caucasian customers. had to wait around to get service for a while . was just here for a layover but i vow never to eat /stop here again."
this was ok - a little over priced for the food that was served. probably will try a different main meal during my next layover however
"been here a few times now. normally, service has been very good. due to covid it has been quite quiet, but they are losing a lot of custom due to lack of staff and very slow service as a result. no signs indicating if table service or food/drinks only areas. people walked back out as they were asking me if i worked there and if there were any staff available! i realise its difficult to keep staff available at these times, but customers must be given the impression that they will get served even if it takes time. "
"excellent food, service mixed. orders were lost in translation, but eventually we got more or less what we ordered. the staff were very pleasant but didnt confirm the order correctly. the food was fantastic, very tasty and nicely presented. we would eat here again but ensure the water understands before finishing the order."
"i have enough during the connection in the airport, and chose this cafÃ© for lunch. the cafÃ© looks quite presentable, and this determined my choice. for my amazement, the reality was, softly said, a little bit different. there were a few of visitors in the cafÃ© but i waited a waitperson to make an order a lot of time. only accumulated tiredness and a really comfortable chair prevented me from simply getting up and leaving. the waitpersons discussed something near the bar counter, and i was obliged to come, go there and remind about my existence. the received lobster soup was slightly warm (however, the tea was really good). this cafÃ© is not an eating house, and it looks different indeed when compared to the other cafÃ©s in the area. therefore, the expectations are appropriate. it remains to hope that it was like an exception in my case. sometimes, such exceptions occur. "
the staff were very slow and rude. i ended up not buying anything but still sat in their lounge.  find other places to spend your money.
worst service there has been over this weekend. oeuf cocotte overcooked and so late my cup of tea had gone cold whilst waiting
"acted as though they were doing me a favor, by seating us and allowing us to eat here.  staff never checked to see if food was good, if we had what we needed â¦. will avoid in the future!"
"i would love to be able to make contact with the owners. what a disgraceful place, lots of staff doing nothing and extremely rude. i had to clean the chair as it was covered in butter, floor filthy table filthy, at this rate i should have left. waited thirty minutes to order , received a tiny glass of champagne, and another fourty five mins later i received oven baked eggs that were microwaved and the waiter giving out hell to me for ordering breakfast that was clearly marked all day breakfast on the menu, disgusting food. i asked for the manager and was ignored went to the counter and a lady who was clearly not the manager told me that she was, i explained my experience and she actually grunted at me, offered no apology, and charged full price of â¬28, guess they get a lot of complaints and are used to  "
"cocoâs should learn basic french if serving french items. hear me out, this isnât an âonly real french food is goodâ rant. i came to the airport very early for a transatlantic flight. surprisingly, lines were short and i had time for a coffee and a croissant at cocoâs. after being directed away from an open one person seat at the bar to a long line a waiting patrons and waiting 20 mins only to be seated in the same seat i originally was told to leave, i brushed off my irritation and looked forward to the âlarge cafe crÃ¨meâ and croissant on the menu. i had to ask for the menu and the waiter was irritated that i could not order off the bat. everything that was being served to other patrons though looked goo "
"i am disappointed with this placeâ¦ l travel through amsterdam airport all the time and always see the place busy and never get chance to call in however, today l di "
i was there with 3 friends. we waited to be seated and after 5 minutes i ask a guy behind the bar âare you ope 
"poor service even few customers were in , food absolutely overpriced and not that  not tasty. deeply regret it. not recomended."
"it took ages to get my food after i had placed the order, but all the staff bar none came to ask me if i had placed an ord "
waited 18 mins - couldnât get anyones attention then finally i was able to ask the girl behind the bar for a glass of champagne. wanted to have lunch but they took too long. lots of visiting amongst the staff with each other - they need to get to work!
"stopped for what i was hoping would be a nice cup of hot chocolate. sat down right in front of the till. went there to order after about 10 minutes, but was told that they have table service. yeah, righ "
"we stopped off at cafe coco for what we thought would be a quick coffee. after waiting for 15 minutes to be served, i approached the bar and was promptly told to return to the table as there was a waiter who would take our ord "
"a group of four, well seasoned travelers, we first could not get the staff to clean the counter of dishes (at least 10 minutes from the previous customers). when we ordered 4 hot chocolates we were served 1 with no others in site for 5 minutes. we asked about our drinks and wanted to order food. we were ignored. after another 5 minutes we were told it was coming. after another 5 minutes we asked for a manager. we were told no one was in charge. the attitude was arrogant. this is not the service we have experienced in the past at schiphol airport. avoid if possible."
"second time in less than a month where they have let themselves down with the service, or should i say lack of  "
"this is the hardest that i have ever worked to get a coffee. the staff were rude, unhelpful and arrogant (except for the lone guy working there who should be put in charge of staff training, starting with teaching the others how to smile - it really was that poor). i still donât understand the seating arrangements and neither did the vast majority of other customers that the staff spent the bulk of their time moving on, rather than getting on with their jobs serving. avoid like the plague."
"do not bother to waste your time and money going here. the service is the most appalling i have had in a very long time. we arrived and sat down, happy to try what looks like a lovely cafeteria in the middle of a busy airport and proceeded to be ignored by all staff. until we decided "
first and last time to this place. â¬10+ for a coffee and croissant and needed to wait 30 mins while âthey prepare itâ. really poor.
"arrived early morning after sleepless overnight flight and looking for a spirit-lifting breakfast at schiphol. cafe coco looked like the right place: attractive setting, varied and seemingly sophisticated menu, courteous personnel. unfortunately, the place is not up to its promise mainly due to the total lack of flexibility and customer attention. they have smoked fish platters on the menu and i request just a simple plate of smoked salmon with a slice of toasted bread: impossible! there is no kind of bread in this fancy place (?!?). i end up ordering a weird egg soufflÃ© topped with two slices of smoked salmon which has all the skin and the dark parts on each slice, and has been significantly heated by the underlying hot egg stuff (which is not particularly tasty). at the end i ask for more hot water in my teapot (tea was made with real leaves and a pretty good brand, in all fairness) and they reply that for hot water i have to pay for a new tea (nearly 5 euros!) even if i use the same leaves. dutch rigidity? or just plain lack of attention to customer satisfaction? weird."
"had a morning flight and arrived at the cafÃ© around 10:00 am. the place was busy. lots of empty dirty tables. since the sign said to seat yourself we did but there were no clean tables so we sat at a dirty table hoping to have it cleaned soon. we sat at a table for 2 right in front of the cashier. the waitress saw us sit down and came over within about 5 minutes and asked us what we would like to order. i quizzically looked at my husband wondering if she was going to clean the table first. she was not. i looked at her and said that we just sat down and had not looked at the menu yet. could she please clean the tables. she said nothing and picked up the dirty plates, cups and utensils. she was surely annoyed i had asked. she came back again and asked what we would like. i told her i would like it if she would wipe down the table since there was clearly someone elses leftover food scraps and water rings. she again looked very annoyed and said she would. she waited 10 more minutes to come back and wipe of the table then took our order. i ordered the baked eggs but asked for no meat or cheese which apparently is in all the baked egg dishes. she looked at me and said no meat or cheese? i said that is right and she looked astounded but left. we waited 30 minutes for 2 baked eggs with coffee and croissants. meanwhile no tables were cleaned and many people, at least 5 that i counted, went to the counter as asked to have the table cleaned and several people were tired of waiting for a server. they too had to get up and ask for help. no one ever came to see if everything was okay which it was not. our egg bake was undercooked and runny at the bottom. having to catch a flight in 20 minutes we decided to just not bother getting another one."
cafe coco was the last place open late at night when we were about to catch a flig 
"i never complain, but really feel the need to today (and signed up to trip advisor for the first time). this was truly terrible food and terrible service! â¬25 for an over cooked (asked for rare got well done) thumbnail size of beef and a plate of broccoli. when i complained the waiter (cynthia) just ignored the complaint, carried on with her duties and didnât make any attempt to resolve the issue / refer it to someone more senior. never eat here !! if youâre in the airport go to burger king for a better meal and better service."
"me and a colleague sat down and ordered, breakfast and latte for me, coffee for him. been waiting for breakfast now for over 40 minutes, my colleague had to leave after 30 minutes without getting his coffee. the latte came after 10 minutes, and is passable."
"nice meal, slow service but a decent choice for a bite between flights. helps that we were there off-peak!"
"we were at schiphol waiting for a later flight and quite tired and hungry, so we chose this (lproper) restaurant, as opposed to one of the convenient cafes or self service places. the service was insanely awful, including not even bringing two of the items we ordered. the rest of the food made airline food taste marvelous -- we were served some sort of microwaved, cardboard tasting pasta with practically raw, cold vegetables on it. when i mentioned all of the problems, they removed the items we hadnt ordered from the bill, which left a still very expensive tab for absolutely rubbish food. avoid this place at all costs and either dine before you get to the airport -- or choose any other food!"
"in the past i have lunch here several times. it is not a place to be in a rush to catch the plane but to take the time and yes, service has as far as i experienced always been slow. but the food was of above average you could get at schiphol airport. last time this was unfortunately not the case. the food was horrible. no taste, no dressing in the salad, prefab? unbelievable bad and still quite expensive."
"the food is just ok, the fish which took 30 minutes to come on the table was overcook, when i asked for a side basket of break ive been ignored by the staff.  however the place is quiet with a nice view on the planes."
"a beautiful little cafe in the airport. the breakfast menu was small but i was looking forward to trying the baked eggs. it was okay, just okay. a bit flavourless and a pretty small portion. the coffee and service was good though."
"having arrived exhausted at schiphol airport to get our flight back to london heathrow, we made our way to what appeared to be a lovely quiet corner in â cafe coc "
"i was very much looking forward to spending my layover time at cafÃ© coco. it looked inviting and trendy. you could see food displayed like quiche, croissants, and numerous desserts , all temptin "
we both had a coffee here whilst waiting for a flight.  there was quite a queue - the coffee was fine but a bit expensive.
cafe coco inside the amsterdams airport was below expectations. the food quality and quantity was average.
"terrible service. ignored for ten minutes. a man pointed me out and they came five minutes after this, not concerned at all with customer service. pointed out the menu on the table (i hadnt seen it) - another 5-10 minutes passed and no one returned so i walked out, disgusted. menu looked great but attitude not worth paying money for."
"cafe coco gave me a pleasant half hours rest on a long stay in schipol. coffee ok, service ok, prices inflated - well it is in an airport!"
"croissant & cappuccino before flight. i sat at the bar, which had lots of dirty used plates, cups etc. even though staff saw the debris around me, it was not cleared. it took 10 mins to supply 1 croissatnt (with jam - which was more a sauce, gradually spreading across the plate} and a very small, medium cappuccino. i had to ask for a knife to spread the jam and spoon to stir the coffee. to be fair, watching other dishes being prepared, i think other dishes were better than my choice."
"this is a great spot for watching planes come and go, but at lunch yesterday my entree did not appear after a good long wait. i asked the waiter for my meal and she said it would be right up. another 10 minutes went by and still nothing. at that point we had to leave. our soup was ok but a very small glass of whiskey was a rip off at 12 euros."
ester the waitress swiped my credit card 8 times saying that system was down  when checked balance she charged 300 us dollars for a 25.14 transaction. this is horrible and no one will answer the phone there.
"i was looking forward to afternoon tea here after passing through schiphol on my way out. unfortunately i had a bad experience. the waiter directed me to sit at a table to be served and then he and two other colleagues served two other sets of people ahead of me, but who had arrived after me. on the second occasion, i indicated this to a waitress, who gestured to me to wait and actually said wai "
"we arrived late at the hotel and wanted some food and a drink. the axis bar had a good menu and an extensive drinks menu. the food was good and ticked the box, the atmosphere was great but it is so dark!! not very sociable!"
"unbearably slow service for a busy place. just one guy in the kitchen . cant wait 10 minutes just to have my order taken, if i have a connection to catch. no comparison to london folks! gave up in the end!"
rubbish. none of the leon breakfast muffins etc. were availanble. only porridge and some croissants and coffee. i portion of porridge and the three coffees took about 10 mins to be served.
"menu sounded amazing, delivery was not only really poor but there was merely anything in the diner box. what a joke. i took the tajine which tastes like a cheap curry. donât go there, quantity and quality are really not up to their menu offer!!!"
"the guy taking orders had no hurry, looked like he just got his two weeks notice. took forever.  very expensive for small meals, and also.. do not have salt.. at all, no jk"
"we ordered baked fries and they were very tasty. staff were friendly once they took our order. however, overall it did look very chaotic as they had a lot of staff but didnât seem to have an efficient customer centric system in place. for example, we went to the counter to order but 4 people were working on the orders taken so no one could take our order. they should have at least one person taking orders continually and not having all working on the same thing because this results in customers waiting to order. it was also result in customers feeling ignored."
know leon from london so felt it could be trusted as an airport eating place. the food filled a gap. it was healthy and organic and they seemed to fo their bit for the environment.
"i was looking to eat something simple, nice and not too unhealthy, when i passed by at leon. everything appeared nice. i ordered a chicken satay. friendly service. so, i got my food fairly quickly, too fast for fresh food. i sat down to eat. the rice was tasteless, as well as the veggies. the chicken had a weird taste en everything was covered with a tasteless spicy sauce. i just couldnât eat it all. i am curious what the ingredients are and what it was meant to be. the coke was d expected."
on the way home i thought i would take a last mea 
"i had the vegan burger âloveâ. tasty yet it could have some more salad or amenities for the price of almost 7 euro.  the fizzy drink is not recommended unless you want something with no sugar and tastes like chilli.  service is quick, and friendly."
"sauce tasted very odd in the chicken rice noodle, almost like it was missing something vital lol. the fries were so under done its actually jokes and the chicken was slimy and burnt how is thay possible. only good thing was the coca cola."
"i ate here with my bf on our way to norway. the food was uneventful and kind of sloppy, but okay its fast food. the system however does not work. you only get a ticket when you pay; not when you order. this resulted in a confused older man before us hearing halloumi and thinking this is my order, only downside, it was our order. his wife returned saying she had ordered the halloumi wrap, not the halloumi burger. i realized by that point that they had taken our order. we tried to explain it to the staff, who were confused, but after 5 minutes trying to explain it, they got i "
had dinner here before taking off. the menu has some lighter asian and north african meals which can be ordered and also served fast. had the chicken satay and it was good but would have liked a larger portion.
"it must have been a surprise to the staff that the customers at the airport needed to catch a flight. the service was appaulling, firstly i was made to wait for a few minutes while the lady behind the counter just ignored me, slowly gathering other peoples food, not acknowledging me at all. when i was served, i was refused the receipt until collection. this fast food was so slow it took 15minutes to receive my breakfast from being 3rd in line. while i was waiting, a staff member slid someones breakfast over aggressively, it fell over and she shrieked. while receiving my coffee, there was no lid available. luckily the coffee was luke warm. when i questioned about a lid, the staff member just shrugged at me. my breakfast muffin arrived and it was not a muffin, but sandwiched between two flatbreads, not what i ordered. all in all a horrible experience, and i never did receive my receipt for expenses."
"i usually want to stress the positive but i was walking through the airport the other day and saw one of these leons on the outer food court, and remembered my meal there on the way to greece two weeks earlier. this establishment does a kind of fusion cuisine but it comes off more like confusion cuisine. i had bean chilli and it was awf "
"dont go to this place. not fresh awful food has nothing in common on pictures. ordered chicken wraps and chicken mezze. we were not able even finish it. was endless waiting for my order, at the end had to go to counter to ask for it. awful servi "
"on 1st may 2019, we had lunch at fast-food outlet leon in the departure lounge at schipol airport as we had some time before our flight to naples. this restaurant together with a number of others are located on the first-floor food court. the menu was prominently displayed behind the service counter. we ordered chili chicken and falafel together with a soda. the boxed hot meals arrived quite quickly. i cannot however say that the meal was tasty. it was an average fast-food meal!"
"slowest service ever. very pleased i had a 3 hour stopover, otherwise might not have made it to front of the line"
"we arrived as schiphol earlier than usual and decided to have a coffee and âcakeâ before checking in. we selected leon. our lattes were delicious (perfect temperature) - my two portuguese natas were good, and my wife enjoyed her pain au chocolat - maar to my right another customerâs tray was filled (eg overfull), and surprise surprise a poke of chips (french fries a la leon) ended up on the floor; perhaps one member of staff did not see (but i later drew it to his attention); the other just turned his back - no replacement french fries were offered even though i drew this to the attention of the restaurant member of staff - it would have been so easy and pleasing to rectify; a completely unnecessary own goal!!!"
having saved 10â¬ specifically to sit down and enjoy some airport food i was happy seeing leon and itâs healthy options. i chose mexican beans thinking - itâs impossible to make mexican tasteless. oh how wrong i w 
"donât like writing bad reviews but the chicken i ate here was awful . very dry and hard , like it had been warmed up over and over again . literally spat it out after first taste . save your money and get something past security on airside . "
although the taste of the actual food is delicious (i had the bacon & egg muffin) the service was mediocre at most (not very friendly) and the muffin was awkward to eat as everything kept falling out. this could definitely improve. (i visited the store in the domestic departure hall.)
"of all the food choices around schiphol airport, we stuck with having leon for dinner since we know that its the healthier option over sandwiches sitting in fridges all day, and frites/kebabs fried to death around the airpo "
"obviously, after a long day serving food, quality standards can be relaxed, we can hang a little, sip our free drink when we are not serving customers, even when we are, we can be slow cleaning up dirty tables, preferably not all of them at the same time, we can forgo cleaning the floor behind the bar, we can shout, and, most of all, we can walk around with a snotty nose, snorting and rubbing mucus across servings. am i exaggerating? nope. this is leon schiphol plaza at 19:30. the avocado and halloumi burger was soggy and squishy, the peas salad was kind of tasty though, as well as the fries. the goji berry water however was some kind of artificial, sugary horror. 16 eur was well over the top for quality delivered. next time ill go for bk across the isle and screw vegetarianism."
"surprised to see higher ratings on this place than expected. the cost is high, the proportions are tiny and the food is bland. looked good from the outside but seriously disappointing."
ordered the thai green curry chicken which came with brown rice and some salad. was disappointed with the serving size and the taste of the curry was just mediocre and a few miserable looking slices of chicken. not appetizi 
"were there on saturday morning june 16th around 10:30 am. there was a girl standing close to the coffe machine. i asked if i could get warm water to make baby milk. she answered that shes too bussy for it, directly looked to another direction and left. she was very rude. there were not more than 3 people waiting in the line and there were queueing for their order being taken by her colleague. i didnt expect michelin star restaurant attitude but she could told me to buy warm water if it isnt allow by the company, which are never happened in the netherlands. very disappointed. dont go there if youre in hurry, with elderly or children."
was excited to find a healthy restaurant in the airport...was quickly disappointed. paid $12 for a grilled chicken burger & fries. could not even bite into the chicken it was so gross. very dark and almost smoked and felt like rubber when i tried to take a bite. fries were hard and cold. threw the whole thing away because i wasnât sure if it was appropriate to send food back in the netherlands.
"ordered the morrocan meatballs for take away and once i opened it, it turned out they forgot to give me half of the meal: no salad, no fresh herbs.. just boring rice, meatballs and some tomato sauce. for 9 euro! i complained at their customer service and they will try to find a solution. perhaps the taste is better when you got to taste the full meal as it supposed to be.."
very smal portion of chicken (maiby 50 gr) in a hot box chicken for just under 8 euro. the few chicken pieces were very dry. really poor food.  ð
"being stuck in an airport we thought this might be a good meal choice, whilst the falafel box was okay the chips were pretty awful. chewy and tasteless, i suppose i should have complained to the staff but being at an airport and grabbing food before we fly it didnt think of it. the layout of the place is also a bit difficult if you have luggage, the tables are fixed and space is restricted."
"omg, this is by far one of the worst fast casual dining experiencr ever. you can fool maybe a lot of people but not me. this is nothing green and healty about this place. its a scam and nothing is fresh. not even the salad."
"its a charming little place with fast service and friendly staff. the food was tasty however, it was a messy experience. i had the sausage and egg on a burger bun but the bun was very soggy because it had too much sauce so the food kept sliding out. it is not a particular cheap place to have breakfas "
we have just had our breakfast at leon and it was dreadful at best. the sausages were powdery and the skins chewy. really strange flavour too. the hash brown bite were just lumps of soggy grated potato and the coffee was cold. we had to wait a long for what i suspect was food that had been pre-cooked the night before and microwaved this morning. as a frequent business traveller from schiphol i can say that this was my last visit. 
had the lemon chicken with rice at nearly eur 9. comes with salat. all nicely prepared however not any taste in the food.
i had the vegan super quinoa salad which was very fresh and tasty but the portion was really small. my friend had the chicken aioli wrap which had barely any aioli in it.
had the meatball burger and fries. bit weird but pretty nice for airport food. place could do with a bit of a clean. floors quite dirty. not great but have had a lot worse in airports over the years.
"chicken & chorizo hot box with chicken chilli...... half portion of luke warm rice, 4 small pieces of over-microwaved chicken thigh meat with a spatter of red chilli oil and a bit of shredded cabbage - â¬8.95. possibly the worst meal ever tasted. what made it even worse was the number of customers that were served after me but got their food before me. by the time mine was ready my hot water had cooled so much it wouldnt brew the teaba "
"my last 2 visits have been awful with slow service, few seats and over cooked food - see the photo of the dry, burned chicken below. if you love leon in london avoid this place."

situated at schiphol plaza which is a messy mini shopping mall at the arrivals section of amsterdam schiphol airport. even with so many shops schiphol airport still lacks good eating options. leon is a newly opened restaurant right next to the always busy burger king. it is situated between arrivals 1-2 and arrivals 3- 
"i tend to get my breakfast from leon when im working nightshifts. they offer tasty food and great coffee. they are expenisive, though."
"we visited leon at schiphol airport before take-off for our summer holiday, since both of us were not that hungry and there was a long line for the burger king we decided to have the chicken burger at leon for the value of about 8â¬ a piece. of course this price sets a certain quality expectation, especially with the competition (on burgers) right next door. after unwrapping the leon chicken burger you realize that the quality expectation that you had while paying the bill, needs adjusting downwards. it is a simple white bun (from the supermarket which sell for 0,80â¬ per 10 pieces) with some chicken and 1 or 2 slices of cucumber and tomato. after the first bite we knew why the line at leon was close to zero and the line for burger king was about 60 people, since the both of us nearly turned green after that bite. the chicken tastes horrible, we tossed the burgers in the bin and went for a burger at burger king. (where you can have a complete menu for the price of one lousy, horrible tasting, cheap looking burger at leon by the way). since we will never even consider returning to leon, this was a once in a lifetime experience for us. "
i had a lamb kofte box. the taste was ok but nothing special. the food comes in a box without compartments which is whyby the time you get to the table it is mixed up somewhat ( i do eat with my eyes). i noticed they also have vegetarian dishes and i must say service was fa 
"the food seemed to be made with fresh ingredients and had good flavour, but the burgers are quite small for 7â¬. better than average."
"just had a egg and sausage muffin and a mocha. the girl at the counter was very friendly! thats why the 3 stars! it starts with a smile. but the products...... that doesnt bring me a smile. the muffin is just a wholeweat bun and its dry! the sausage is bland and the skin is really chewy. the drop of sauce is tomato but tasteless too. the egg overcooked. the mocha is coffee with instant chocolate powder which isnt dissolved yet, so coffee with clumps in it. sad :-("
the food is not bad but we can expect better when we see the restaurant. there is hardly enough food in the box a little more would be great. i took a box with chicken ( not the best part of the chicken ) and a lemonade that was good. friendly staff. do nlt hesitate to eat in another restaurant id you ca 
"a relatively new place at schiphol airport, focussing on all natural burgers etc (interestingly located next to the bk schiphol). i ordered a chicken burger with fries. in all honesty, i wasnt really impressed. the chicken fillet was a little flat in taste, and the fries we soft. should i have complained, probably yes, did not have the time. will go back as probably i just was not lucky this time."
"the staff are very good and friendly, but the food was terrible. i had the chicken burger which was wet and disgusting. the chicken was only in one half of the burger and the whole thing looked like it was made a few hours ago. it was not fres "

"treated a family that have recently moved to the netherlands. we have had meals here in the past so were confident that we would have a good experience. sadly not - meal ruined by poor service. our original booking was lost, so had to wait while tables were pulled together. drinks orders were lost, chilled wine in cooler unpoured during the meal, had to prompt for dessert menus. tap water refused except for one person - no table iced water, so had to buy a bottle of evian.had to chase for the bill, by this stage i refused to leave a tip. not clear who was in charge, and staff did not seem to want to be there, doing their best to ignore us. poorly led and poorly trained. the food itself was good, beautifully cooked and well presented. the bill for the 6 of us, just shy of e500."
two stars for the lovely two ladies with black glowing hair. they were the best in their job but sadly the cooks must be having a bad evening as i did not find seafood or salad dressing without any flavor. expensive.
"unfortunately, i canât tell you if the food was good or not. we walked in, they told us to take a seat and the waiter would be with us in a minute.the waiter never came over. we gave a sign twice for them yo drop by our table but they ignored it. looked at me in my face, never came and attended other people that walked in after us. i am bi-racial and i must say, i have never felt so discriminated in my life:("

"we wanted to have dinner, which we have done many times before. this time only buffet style was available. we did not think that would be a problem, as the food was always up to standard. this time was an exception. the food was almost cold and had no taste, the main as well as the desert. i went to the supervisor to inform her about this. she agreed that it should have been much better and apologiz "

when you are staying in an airport hotel you tend to lower your expectations. but this was beyond that. when we asked why our meal was taking so long we were told the kitchen was âclosedâ - overwhelmed with âtickets â. in the end the food was mediocre and would have been badly overpriced had not the captain adjusted the bi 
i reviewed this restaurant last year and was served a horsemeat steak which was labeled as a beef steak. i read the managementâs response and rejection to my review so i decided to try the restaurant agai 
"we had a business dinner here while staying at the hotel. the food was pretty good for an airport hotel, but the service was extremely slow. they appeared to not have enough staff and were quite busy. i did have breakfast here three days and the food was good. it is a buffet with many choices of foods."
"wow.... this place is expensive; really expensive. i wanted something real to eat before i would get on my trip. it is in the sheraton hotel. i did expect it to be decent, and organised. i would have expected to be paying too much. it is schiphol after all. but this is completely out of wack. wine 6 times the price you pay in the shop (i accept 3). service is amateurish (at best). cooking, as you expect... for that kind of money... i will not go again"
"i have eaten here twice and each time felt somewhat disappointed. i had a veal that was tasteless, as were the sides. the caesar salad was so so. really not worth the price, but better than eating at the airport i suppose."
i went to this restaurant with high expectations that i was in for a culinary treat. from the way the menu was laid out to the side sauces and rubs it filled with anticipati 
"had two meals in the stripes restaurant in the sheraton amsterdam airport hotel. first was dinner in the bar area. service was average or below. food was ok; appetizers were better than main course. for breakfast there is a buffet which was very nice; good selection of fruits, eggs and meats. service at breakfast was much better."
"buffet was okay, a lot of items needed to be refreshed,  very few yogurts to choose from. the restaurant is much better then the club lounge, if you have a choice!"
stopped by here after a long work-day.  had to sit at the bar for about 10 minutes before getting served even though there were servers just standing near-by.  only had a snack and the food was ok.  drink selection is typical for amsterdam.
"this is a good looking but typical âin-hotelâ restaurant. the menu is well worked through with a good selection of food and wine, and food is tasty (we had both fish and meat). the downside is the slow and distracted service staff....the head waiter is friendly and alert, but the rest of the staff are very slow, forget orders and seems in general distracted by their own dreams... improvement potential!"
this is the restaurant of the sheraton and honestly there is nothing special about  
cold and tasteless food. terrible service. staff apparently untrained. no visible management. probably better to eat in the airport.
okay the food was excellent (except the trifle for dessert) but theyâre really pushing it with the prices. i ordered the recommended 3-course meal and had 2 glasses of wine. the damage? $100 - and thatâs without the tip .. the service was great and deserved one. anyway i would try somewhere else next time i need dinner near schiphol.
"bitterbal of veal with polenta, green peas, black garlic jus and apple compote was very tasty. but 32,50 euros for it was far too much. service was quick and casual."
"stripes at the sheraton is elegant and convenient. service of the friendly staff is very good. it is not cheap to eat here and though it has everything to make this a nice fine dining experience the food comes up short. i was pleased with the duck appetizer but both my wifes sirloin as well as my filet mignon came up short, lacking the tenderness you should expect for an expensive piece of meat. the side orders of potato and wild mushrooms are huge ,enough for two people ."
the atmosphere was nice put the food was bland. the mashed potatoes were pre-prepared and served in slices with a day old taste. a very poor value.
"obviously, the place you go to for meals if you stay at sheraton schiphol. the location is convenient, the appointments are in place, and the ambiance is generally pleasa "
"just refused the business menu main course after smelling it and tasting a small bite. after the soup (not so nice or fresh asparagus) we received really bad smelling cod fish. it was rotten! i travel a lot and often stayed in the sheraton but this was terrible! already feeling bad, i hope not to get sick from this! an absolute bad experience "

"airport was busy and this place looked a little quieter. put my order in (chicken satay and glass of wine). after an age i checked on my order, my wine hadnt been put through and the food would be a while. eventually wine turned up. an age later my food arrived after being offered to two other tables. wish it hadnt served better looking food to my dog. was some talk of a free wine but as i write the head waitress is arguing against this. unbelievable really, avoid"
"***avoid this restaurant*** went 01/12 with a few friends. ordered two satay chicken mains and 2 of their hamburgers and some nachos. absolutely awful... chicken satay sauce was a thick disgusting mess with chewy chicken and the wedges seemed like that had been sat for a while as some were solid and others barely warm. the burger were equally as bad, way too overloaded with sauce to make up for the dry beef burger and wedges on them were again bad. the nachos had a enough cheese to cause a small heart attack making them into a solid block which was difficult to eat. very expensive and waitresses didnât seem at all interested with how the food was. ***avoid this restaurant***"
standard place to eat something at schippol airpo 
"crossroads is a good place to visit after waiting for someone at the arrival hall in schiphol. we had some tea and the famous dutch bitterballen. however, these were not fried in oil but warmed in an oven (afterward we saw that the menu said oven bitterballen so we should have known). they were warm and still soft, and two of them were even to cold to eat. a big disappointment. the tea was nice and hot though."
"a party of 9 of us tried to eat here.... the meals all came at different times, all food was cold, but 2 were too cold to be acceptable and were sent back. we also found plastic in one of the meals! we tried to speak to the manager about it but she was very rude. never had a worse meal/service!"
i am also working in hospitality and i know that it is a challenge to find good staf 
"while a good place for a beer, the food was poor. my burger, which was passable, came with a serving of wedges (listed as french fries on the menu), while my wife had a steak (tough) served with some frozen vegetables that were luke warm and looked unappetising. the service was efficient and reasonably friendly. would look at other options next time."
"one star is even too much .i was waiting there for 10 minutes to be attended but none of the staff came . they were busy chit chatting with each other. i reached the counter to place the order. girls standing there didnât even greet. they ask me â what you want to haveâ in a rude tone. another one rolled her eyes . service was pathetic . they serve the food as if they are doing a favor. most of the time i have seen them looking at customers, whispering to each other and laughing at them . i work in service industry and i understand the body language very well. i ll not suggest this restaurant to anyone . i did find them racist. white people were served first and they look down on other nationalities. i have noticed a staff member was talking to his friend ( was not the restaurant employee)for 15 minutes and i think she gave him some free food while customers who were waiting to pay and eat was ignored.restaurant authorities you can check your cameras. your staff is horrible. if they were working in my company they would have got terminated because rudeness and racism is not tolerated at all."

crossroads is a good place to wait for arriving passengers in the arrival 2 hall. it is next to the arriving passengers and nicer setup while you donât how long you wait is going to be. other than that itâs a regular cafe not to be remembered afterwards.
"very soggy and burned chips, hardly eatable, neater one of us finished their fries. you better go to mc donalds or burger king."
"after waiting for our luggage that was not coming because of hanging in the airport of toronto, we really needed to have lunch and we went to this (new) restaurant. we ordered chips (pommes frites) and it was quick service. you can see that the frites are slices unpeeled potatoes and it tasted oke, only its too dark. they have already fried it and put it back above the frying pan. yes, it would be very handy and quick work for them when its crowded but in fact theyre frying it two times, thats why it was too dark and there was a lot of small dark hard pieces. the mayonaise was good and the price is oke. the staffs were busy talking to each other and one of them were eating his wrap and we saw the other, once a while put something into the mouth. it could be better."
"hi, we stopped here for lunch when we arrived at the airport from montreal. we had a little time on our hands so the thought sounded good. wow, a nice busy airport with lots to do and gather some information on ground transportation and schedules. so we had a kebab, burger and fries. all were served rapidly and hot. it was fine for fast food and an airport meal. there are also other fine choices like the seafood kiosk not too far."
"had fries here once we got out of departures for a quick snack, and also on our last night in amsterd "
we were hungry and it was convenient.  wasnt terrible and it wasnt great.  the staff were not overly friendly / helpful - possibly the language barrier.
read about the place so took the opp to visit the place since we were in amsterdam airport. service was fast so thats good. 7euro for a medium bag of fries with ketchup and mayo is not exactly value for money. i would suggest you give this place a miss try the pizza restaraunt next door. we tried it later and preferred that for sure.
"i got a small fries, and they were cold. i ask for hot ones. they were happy to give me a new serving, but that one was a mix of older stale friea with fresher ones. not cool."
restaurant located inside the hote 
we had a dreadful experience at mcdonaldâs in the airport. food was freezing cold and when we brought it back they laughed at us. disgraceful experience altogether. even management was not helpful. stay away
waited for ages to be seated with staff actively ignoring us. extremely rude when spoken to. do not go here if you want a nice meal.
"waited for ages at the door to be seated with members of staff walking to and fro past us with no acknowledgement. eventually got a table sat next to 2 other guests, which was a bit odd, but we were grateful for a seat. we were completely ignored after this and had to ask at the bar if we could order food and drinks. our drinks arrived - food was left on the pass for a long time while disorganised members of staff flitted about or stood chatting. our food arrived and the waitress left, i presumed for cutlery but i was wrong. i had to go to the kitchen area to ask for a knife and fork. choice of food on the menu is poor and the food wasnt great but was let down by every other part of the experience. had to ask to pay the bill - over 50 euro for pasta, a burger, a medium beer and a coke."
went in this cafÃ© for breakfast before my fligh 
"first of all i really do think this restaurant is in violation of eu policy with no mention of allergens in the menu and no information about this when asked. waiter had to check each individual dish with the kitchen. making rhings worse the steak was watery, weak, and seemed microwaved. absolutely not somewhere to eat. the frites was fairly nice though. "
"i decided to skip burger king for het palais! a big mistake as i had the experience of the worst hamburger ever! the meat taste bad and us obviously some industrial chemical cook up! this was a true art of incompetence by this rather nice lookng place.avoid the food, unless you are through a half bottle of vodka at the bar!"
"unwelcoming, unfriendly, rude staff. we were on transit and wanted to sit for coffee on a very busy day at schipol airport, one table was available but without chair, so the waiter told us that we must sit at the bar since this table had no chair. another customer gently offered us a chair that we took to sit at the table. the waiter comes yelling at us that we did not follow his instructions and that we must sit at the bar again although we managed to find a chair. poor sense of hospitality, no proactiveness, 0 customer service!"
the staff is everything but friendly especially the old bold man. i am happy that i didnât spend my money at that place. please do yourself a favor and start your holiday somewhere else.
horrible servic 
"on the 24th of june at around 19-00, my father, had an unfortunate experience of being subjected to rude behavior by an employee of het paleis bar in terminal 1. the waiter in question without provocation used inappropriate, racially motivated words on my father. i am attaching the photo of the employee in question. please go to another bar if you read this."
"very standard dish, chicken satay, looked like cooked some hours ago and pre-fab. prawn crackers probably made yesterday. fries are better in every other place in the benelux. and this eur 25. my mistake for being hungry and optimistic."
"i was told the food would be 30 minutes, after 1 hour and 15 minutes there was still no sign of my food. however, two tables next to me who came after me had been served their meals. when i asked what was happening i was told there was a mistake in the kitchen and my food would be another 15 minutes. when my food finally did arrive (chicken satay and chips), it was bland and only slightly warm. there was no apology for the delay. when i asked to pay i was ignored and had to ask 3 times. itâs like the staff donât realise they are working in an airport and people might have somewhere to be. the chicken satay and gin & tonic cost 35â¬ and there wasnât even a garnish with the gin. pathetic. wish i had gone to burger king! donât be fooled by the nice exterior, this place isnât worth the price or the wait."
"waiting to get seated just got too tiresome, as staff continued to ignore us.. we were directed to the restaurant when the cafe had closed the kitchen at 20.00. for now, not recommendable."
"slow and uninspired service, and gas station level burger. i regret not going to burger king instead. we had to wait for the bill a long time, and then had to get up from the table and pay at the desk to get out. at the same time people were queuing to get inside."
"what an awful place. i came here today with my partner, saw they sold a meatless burger, double checked with the waitress that it was vegan - she assured me it was and told us to take a table. after a short wait we were greeted by a different waiter, so being careful as always i asked him to confirm it was vegan which he did, but then on being asked about the mayonnaise, he responded well i dont know if its vegan or not... so i asked him if they could veganize it and after briefly checking with the chef he confirmed it was not vegan but vegetarian. okay. can you please tell me the vegan options? i asked him, only to be told that this restaurant does not cater for vegan "
"very small menu, great service and a perfect place to have a beer and a hamburger meanwhile you wait at the airport. iâve visited twice when connecting flights."
"the restaurant looks nice from outside, thats why we choose it. but the food and drink selection was a disappointment. they couldnt provide a slice of gluten free bread, or any  milk alternative , or even a cup of decaff coffee for our breakfast."
"went here for lunch and ordered the club sandwich without tomato. when i got the sandwich i could straight away spot a massive tomato glaring at me. i told the waiter, who apologized and took it back. she then came back 2 minutes later with what was obviously the same sandwich. on the crust there was gooey tomatoseeds and i found two pieces of tomato still within the sandwich. told the other waiter about it when she asked how everything was. she said she would talk to the waiter in question.. aaand proceeded to never return to our table. we eventually paid at the counter. no discount, no nothing. my gfs 18 euro pasta was mall cafe quality at best (which, to be fair, is expectable at an airport). left the place annoyed and unsatisfied. would not recommend"

"we ordered 2 beer and hamburgers waiting for our next flight and it took about 45 minutes for them to first come with one hamburger, then 15 minutes later the second hamburger. still no beer. i told the waitress for the first time about us still not having drinks - we waited a while, nothing happened. i asked another waiter about the drinks, waited. nothing. when we were nearly done with the hamburgers i went upp to them again, and then at last we got 2 beer. in the end noone came even near us, so that we could ask for the bill. had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the 50 euro for everything. "
the service was bad! we waited a really long time to get service and it ended with us searching for a waitress. the staff had a bad attitud and was not serviceminded. when we got our drinks our soda had no gas at all. the table was not clean or cle 
i had to wait 20 minutes until we were served and then had to wait another 20 minutes for it be deliver 
id rather drink here than in the alternative at schipol. they have decent beer and traditional dutch food. its always been quite relaxed. the service here is much more friendly than other airport bars i have visited: staff smile and seem motivated to provide helpful service.
we thought we come here because it was more expensive and youâd expect better service - wrong! i had to go and ask for assistance and was impolitely told to go back to my seat and wait!
"what can i say: when you want to have a meal at the airport, usually you are quite* in a hurry. this place is totally disorganised, no sense of customer service. we ordered the burger and a chicken sandwich. although the drinks were served immediately we had to threaten to leave after 30 minutes, the only answer that the waiter gave was that everyone was complaining ..it took another 10 or 15 minutes to get our food..since we were close to the kitchen we could see that our food was ready for a while already when the waitress picked it u "
"i was here on two different occasions, and have two very different opinion "
"this restaurant is horrible. this is the first time i stomped out of a restaurant as it has such horrible services. they want us to look for an empty table on our own.. and all tables were apparently reserved. my point is.. if you do not have the capacity or resources, dont expect your customers to be scavenging around for an empty table that can be used. also, before we went into the restaurant, there is this waiter who gave us a racist look. yes we are asians. whats your problem??? stop being racist, move  "
impolite and indifferent waiters. i was waiting for 30 min and was not possible to even order. really very bad behavior.
total lack of understanding of what service means. also i am not too sure the staff realize that they are working on an airport and that people need to take plan 
"the quiche (with spinach) was quite good actually, and there was plenty of parmazan cheese and dressing on the side salad....but i fail to understand why the dressing was on the bottom of the plate and not over the sal "
staff were really rude and didnât seem bothered about giving them 100+ euros. was waiting 15 minutes to be served and had to ask for a menu followed by waiting another 20 minutes until the waiter didnât even bother to come and take our order! quite terrible service 
"so, ive been sitting for the las 15 on one of the outside tables waiting for someone to come. as i could see the waiters were busy i went inside and wanted to place the order myself. the barman sent me back to my table kindly letting me know that (quote) we have table service (unquote). so we are leaving. let the barman know my displeasure in no uncertain terms and i didnt get a single word in retur "
total chaos. took forever to take our order. then took forever to deliver the meal. after 40 minutes suddenly they realized the meal we ordered was no longer on stock. waited a further 30 minutes to get another choice. terrible.
well the burger was ok but the fries cold and the service personal is more interested in their mobile phones than serving the guests. toke 10 minutes to get the bill and pay
"thought to go for a quick bite. ordered a salad and waited for more than 20 min. then they came back that they ran out of salad! ordered something else and they promised to speed it up. after another 25 min still nothing ! asked one the ladies who were serving to check, no feedback at all. went again to another waitress and they forgot again my orde "
this restaurant is located between terminals so it is convenient to pause here if you are going to fly outside of eu. we (like almost everybody else) ordered their classic burgers and beer combo. food was absolutely ok and price level as expecte 
"10 minutes is how long i waited befora i left. i was sitting 5 meters from the bar, but the 5(!) waiters were to busy talking to eachother, so nobody came to get my order."
"from the outside this cafe looks nice and cosy. however, you are in for quite an experience from start to finish, if you get in. they want you to wait at the entrance for seating, which makes sense, but apparently no one is assigned to seating, so you can wait forever before you get the attention of staff. once seated it is another trick to again get the attention of staff to order, and once this has been achieved food takes a while to arrive. the menu is ok, but nothing spectacular. having finished your meal you will again have to work miracles to get the attention of staff to pay, and if you are paying by credit card you will be asked to go to the bar counter anyway, so you might as well make your way there to start with, and see if you can get the attention of anyone there. all in all not a good experience, and a little sad, as the location and atmosphere could make this a great experience with a little coordination and enhanced service from staff."
"the service is really shockingly slow and poor. i waited for 30 minutes to place my order. drinks never arrived. food arrived about 30 minutes later. nearly missed my flight on a 90 minute connection. food was passable, but not great - not good enough for the pain of the service. i travel through schiphol a lot, but will never go back. "
i was waiting more than 30 min before a waiter came to me for taking the order. at an airport where the people are in hurry before the have their flight this is a no- 
"i visited on a monday around 1:00 pm. while it was a little busy, there were pleanty empty seats in the house. i sat at a table that needed to be cleaned off from previous customer. perhaps they cleaned it after i left, but they sure did not while i was ther "
"very unpolite and unprofessional service. discussion mutually, being unpolite when serving. i will never come near this place."
two years ago they served ok food. now the best they serve is x-tra cold heinek 
"they tried to cheat with the wine . we ordered a bottle of wine which they brought already opened and explained how that was normal course . after we insisted they quickly exchanged for an unopened wine which was still overpriced ( 12 eur retail vs 65 at the restaurant ) . the burgers were with frozen beef, the chicken caesar was with smoked precooked supermarket chicken . this place is fully unacceptable for the standard of amsterdam airport . "
"waiting 45 minutes for serving. everytime we approach the staff, they say please wait a minute ill be right with you."
i have written quite some reviews of this place. that is because i return here once a while since i travel a lot from this airport. review score varied in the past with a single uplift once where i had the impression management paid notice of my suggestio 
"45min waitingtime. two of us got their food, the third burger was forgotten and i had to order something else. disaster!"
"airport restaurant only has one main goal: be fast. most of the people cannot wait 40 minutes to be seated when you have 20 free tables and 50 minutes for a salad. great job, you did it."
"a complete horror show. staff were clueless, ignorant and not interested.  shambles of a place. every customer was very frustrated. avoid. i feel sick....."
"the only place that comes close to this restaurant in originality is probably murphys, still het paleis has been an icon of the departures area since 2004. its a scaled down replica of samuel sarphatis 1950s palace for folk art. decor is art deco with lots of wood, cast iron and a gigantic brewers kettle up on the first floor. coke goes for â¬ 3,50, beer for 5, soup 8,50 and a plate of food around 20. when i visited last, service was quite ok, even if the place was packed."
we usually eat at het paleis when we travel from schiphol and the food is pretty decen 
"it seems that i was not the first. went to the bar counter and stood there for 5mins waiting to be served, with 5 staff members inside and around the bar. decide to face one of them, who told me that i could not be served at the bar (after 3 persons took their drinks, seating around the bar counter). i have asked to talk with the manager, all of them answered, âthere are no managerâ. asked for the complaint book, there was no book either. this people just doesnât care, people are just keep coming in. my complaint will follow to the netherlands and airport authorities. concerning the ones reading this review... good luck!"
pretty good restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and very nice service.i like it and i keep going .
"the staff are not interested in doing their job. we had to find the menus ourselves, and left after 30 minutes without them even taking our order."
"i had a nice asian chicken, but the waitor was not so interested in his customers. perhaps a how to treat your customer-workshop would be useful...?!"
thought this place looked quite nice from the outside but should have realised it was a shocker when i saw filthy tables and staff just wandering by the queue of people at the doo 
"been here several times. interiÃ¶r a mixturen between belle epoque and an irish pub. usually quite fast service, however oftentimes (as most service personer on schiphol) indifferent. food ok bit nothing more."
"we wanted to have meal at a restaurant at schiphol with real table service, which is not very easy to find. the place at first sight looks inviting, and so does the menu, but as has already been mentioned by previous reviewers, service is pretty bad. it took ages for someone to notice us, the waitresses were less than pro-active and more interested in chatting to each other than serving customers. the food in itself was fine, as were the drinks, but overpriced. better management of staff is strongly advised, but as all the catering options at schiphol are run by the same company and therefore monopolised, there is probably little motivation to improve."
"youll be deluded. even in non-peak hours theyll let you down. slow, unfriendly service and delusional food (untrue to description)."
"the black coffee was fine and the espresso was not the best, a bit acidic. the seating was fine, less crowded as at starbucks. friendly staff."
"the bread was far to hard to cut through with the butter knife. tasteless and no gravy or sauce in the burger. ketchup and mayo was presented next to the plate, then you had to build your burger yourse "
my flight with klm got delayed and i received on the klm app one voucher of 10 euros value. i picked some snacks and when i showed the app voucher on my phone they did not accept unless it was paper printed. i left the stuff there. 28.02.2018 16:14
this is not meat ! mcdonalds is better !!  french fries not good either.   only the beer is ok.  far too expensive for what it is.   nice situation thats all...
"this place is very strange. you wait forever for service, but some people are evidently fine with that. the staff are quite abrupt when they do finally notice you, and they are not particularly rushed. looking around though you feel that you might be the only person with a flight to catch, as plenty of people are smiling, drinking and chatti "

"the service and food was so bad, i downloaded tripadvisor, created a new account and made my first comment here just so i can tell you all how bad this place i "
"not a good choice. they were very busy, so i felt like i am annoying them with my questions. long waiting time for baverege, but fast food delivery. the burger i had was good teste except for being totatally killed by overcooking... will not go again"
"early bfst when going on a family vacation?? 6,95â¬ for a simple take away sandwich!!!! absolutely unaccepatable"
the service here could be significantly better here. so could the food. at best it is boring snacks - nothing more  on the positive side the het paleis is placed centrally in schiphol airport.
"pricey place, found a hair in my food, pointed it out to waitress who took my plate away and never returned with an explanation. later went to pay and they charged the full amount saying the hair i found was from an artichoke even though no artichoke was on the plate. best to avoid. "
"sandwiches and coffee before boarding a flight. 45 euro for 4 sandwiches and 4 drinks .. is overpriced, especially if the coffee is not good. went to neighbor starbucks for a good dopio afterwards."
been here twice or three time on business transfers. ( not always my choice). the food is quite alright. i had the dutch burger (without bread...coeliac). they were happy to modify the meal for my gluten requirements so that is ni 
"nice service, food is ok (we had some snacks before our flight), drinks ok (a standard dutch pub measure.) beers fresh from the barrel. but prices are a real rip-off. for a ketel1, where you pay in a normal pub between 2 and 3 euro, 8.50 was charged. for the dutch delecacy bitterballen we paid 7 euro for a portion of six whilst in normal pubs you pay between 4 and 5 euro. a 3 for the pub but a 1 for the rip-off"
"we were changing planes in amsterdam and have used this place before. the food and service were always good. we arrived there with around 55 minutes before having to go to the gate for the next plane, ordered soup and sandwiches and a couple of beer "
"people working here really hate their job. if not, they do a good job of acting. donât be surprised to be forever waiting at your table because waiter will never look at you. you need to âgrabâ a waiter for servic "
"we came here for a cappuccino and were sitting outside. after some time without service we went inside to order and the staff was very rude. one waiter told us to order at the bar and at the bar they told us to order at the waiter. the waiter thenbtold us he would make a round through the bar and would serve us very last. finally after 30+ minutes another waiter served the cappuccino by almost throwing them on the table. very bad service, do not go here. horrible place!"
"airport restaurants are airport restaurants. so we dont use them with great expectations. but this one nearly drove us insane with the service. we had to remind our drinks four times, and kindly so. in return we had rude attitude instead of an apology. i urge the owners to train their staff about the basics of etiquette if hey want to keep charging the prices they do."
airport cafes are airport cafes. very seldom a place you return to me. this is no exception: i will not return. overpriced caesar salad and a sloppy served white beer. service quite nonchalant.
"this is one of the best places to eat. you can read my many reviews as i am a frequent guest. the only problem most of the staff suffer from is arrogance and lack of real customer service. the typical waiter looks away from anyone so you need to stand up and get attention if you want to order. typical unfriendly posture, hating the job or simply no education in hospitality at all. i have been here over 20 times now and must say this is the core problem of the staff; no hospitality. they are there to make their hours and unluckily serve you when they feel like it. nothing wrong with the food; just with the people serving  "
"i was recently departing schiphol and wanted to try a new restaurant, and when i walked past the striking two-story building-within-a-building of the grand cafe het paleis, i thought it would be a good choice. after nearly a 10-minute wait to be seated, i was ushered to a dirty table by a server who promptly disappeared. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and, when i asked politely, gave me a menu. i ordered a eur 6 belgian trippel and the dutch burger, a 180g beef patty with gouda and bacon. although the menu doesnt mention it, the burger comes with fries. the food arrived in about 15 minutes and was delicious. once i finished eating, i waited another 15 minutes or so for my check. the food was quite good, and the hardwood, glass, and brass decor of the bar is pleasant to look at. however, the service was slow even by european standards, so i wont be going back."
really slow service. we had to wait for 20 min for two salads. the tables were not cleaned and the service looked really unhappy with their job. not coming back.
"food was ok but we had to wait 15 minutes and call 4 times the waiters to order our meal. actually i had to go myself to call one of them to fibally get attention. even after the order they left the table dirty from previous customers and i asked one of the waiters to clean it up. no follow up, so i asked again another one who answer that she did not have anything to use to clean it and it was not her job and suggested me to ask another one. therefore for the second time i had to get up and go asking to clean the table. when they finally delivered the food the table was still dirty and the waiter started putting down our plates on the dirty table. i told him i would not have eaten my food on a disgusting table with glasses and food from previous customers and after another careless comment and simile from the waiter, he finally cleaned it "
it was not that busy and apparently they couldnt accept more people in the restaurant! i find that really disappointing since it is the only real restaurant to eat at schiphol... maybe we could try next time.
"went there for dinner. many tables free, but no one care to clean them. no waitres no hostess to guide you to a table. when asking where to sit; choose any table  but the case was no clean tables. aprroaching the staff was disappointin "

"been there for breakfast. ordered  small paris breakfast  , that includes a glass of juice, croissant with marmalade, butter and jam, but no coffee . felt myself fooled with breakfast that doesnt include coffee and need to order as extra, that makes the small parisian breakfast quite overprice "
"i used to go there every time i had to go to amsterdam. it has changed, though. and, i must say that it has been for wor "
"beautifully decorated buzzy place, after 10 minutes you forget you are actually at the airport.  after 30 minutes (with no food) the thought of catching a flight comes back to your mind.  after 45 mins you want to fly home.  shame"
"looking at the same menu as 10 years back, there is a limit to how many times you think chicken satay is exciting. but really there is a huge lack of good dining options at schiphol."
"according to the airport information desk, this is the only sit-down restaurant in the main terminal of the airport.  it was not overly cramped, the food was pretty good, and the price was acceptable by airport menu standards."
i was there looking for a lunch when i was waiting for my transit flight back to hk. my husband and i walked in the restaurant a waitress asked 
queues too long for average food and snotty waitresses who think they are goddesses who have the power of life and death
"busy place in the heart of ams airport, where i usually have dinner before flying back home with a late flight. staf is really welcoming, and there is a variety of meals for you to chose from, from light finger foods to full size burgers."
"i wanted to go to a proper restaurant in the amsterdam airport so i came across this one that looked decent. i ordered the spicy coconut soup, along with bread. oh my! the soup was very cold when it arrived. and the spice level was non existent! it should not be advertised as spicy when there is honestly no spice whatsoever. i was actually confused about thi "
"good service, quick and friendly. good standard pretty good for an airport . as always for captive audience pretty pricey, but if the food is ok you dont mind too much. this restaurant fits purpose and as better than most."
"supposedly table service, dont be fooled. ignored for the first 15 mins and no the place was not busy, and quite a noisy place with echo and a tad cold. i ordered satay, which was dry and stale along with the fries. there was no love to be found in the food at all, they are not thinking about your next visit. definitely overpriced for the quality. will not return."
"last dinner in the netherlands for this time. an ok ribeye, a good tiramisu, a good bottle of rioja matching the ribeye perfectly. to end wit "
"ordered a plain rib-eye steak medium +. the food came after a long time of waiting, and it turned out they had brought the wrong order. i pointed this out and told that i had ordered something else. then i get a steak that is raw and cold, which i again explain is not okay. after an eye rolling they tried again after a long time of waiting. i ended up with a bad and tastelessly overcooked steak and side dishes and vegatables melted completely. it appears theyve put everything in the oven for re-heating. (at this point i realized this, since the plate was burning hot!) poor service and food, overly priced! left with the decision that im not coming here again for sure. ps. im a former chef and a waiter, trust me on this one."
i had a caesar salad and the satay chicken skewer 
use the facility for a bit between flights when you dont want self-service places. the food is definitely routine made and served and the presentation is not very interesti

"stopped for a meal before our flight, but might as well not hav "
"not exactly grand rather big and spacious self service place, you wont have to wait to be seated. popular and always busy, just opposite security checks, yet the food is fresh and plentiful."
we had beers here waiting for a connection. the food seemed quite good and primarily dutch. beers are ok in that you get more choice than just heineken. it has a nice atmosphere and looks different to the usual airport bar.
"airports are often a challenge when you want to eat something proper, still have some time left and not granted access to the lounges. you often have the fast food places, bars with bar food, sandwich counters and such. so yes it is nice to be able to sit in a bit more restaurant type grand cafe where there are waiters to help you. then at least you dont have to carry your food tray in one hand and your lugage in the other, which is often not practical when you travel alone. this place would suit you. staff is friendly, bit clumpsy in my case. food came quick. yet the quality is compared to the price not in balance. its too expensive. the flavour is average and you can make it yourself at home as well. even the taste was of product you buy at your local supermarket. why 20 euro almost for a chicken sate with pre fabricated tasting rice. and almost 8 euros for a small glass of wine? it is not a premium place, the airport prices again. unfortunate. i picked 3 stars as rating where it should be 2,5. convenience yes, quality no. "
the food and service were o 
"i pass through schiphol frequently and its hard to find somewhere to kill time and relax over food in the airport. this place is not inviting - crowded, noisy and with cramped tables. but surprisingly the food was ok - generous, tasty and comforting chicken satay. and the service was civil and quick enough. what a horrible place to work as humanity surges in and out, either bored witless or frantically rushed. i think the staff do pretty well considering. for an airport its better than cdg paris but not as good as lhr t5 london."
"nothing to complaint, but those airport restaurants always create this nonsense stress feeling. difficult to enjoy. they are probably trying to rotate the tables too fast. too many tables. too much noice. service just ok. you are a number, not a customer."
"we have tried it several times because it is a restaurant on airport schiphol where there is service. but that is just the problem: the service is sooooo slow. when tou ask about it, the utterly uninspired staff simply says that it is normal to wait 45 minutes for a simple sandwich. with no regret whatsoeve "
"not only they did not clean our table, but we had to order 3 times. we did not get glasses for our water. the staff was incompetent and lost - everyone saying someone else would serve us. we wait for the food. and we still were seen as inconvenient because we dared to complain."
"cant say that id eat here again. i was left standing by the entrance for a minute or so before i decided to simply find myself a vacant table. plenty of waiters saw me, but none of them bothered to acknowledge my presence and help me to find a tabl "
"look nice from the outside. a little bit noisy with music and bad acoustics. got a ride year which the cook seems to have cooked instead of fried. bad quality meat with another of fat (even for a rib eye). the vegetables were lousy, however the mashed potatoes was good. there were oot of ice for the dessert at 5pm! the servants were a little bit slow but nice and friendly. not a place i will visit again"
"where in the universe does fast and attentive service matter more than anywhere else? yes, on an airpor "
schiphol airport does not have that many places to go for good food. this grand cafe offers very decent food. that is simply the reason why i go here. i frequently visit this place when i travel outbound at lunch ti 
"only restaurant we ever go to at schiphol. waiters are friendly and the food is ok! its hot and tastes good. seriously, they make the best bitterballen ever eaten at an airport."
"ok place, but typically airport cafÃ© with nice food but double or even triple price. it hurts to pay 3,15â¬ for a small bottle of mineral water, when 1l in the super market costs 0,65â¬. good offer of sandwiches and friendly staff."
went in to get a burger with chips and a co 
"average food at an above average price, although to be expected in an airport. unfortunately the service was abysmal, 45 minutes to order, the order wrong, and no attempt to ask whether it was right. on making a complaint, no attempt to address the issue. i was left with the impression that it didnt matter, since im unlikely to return anyway. "
"my plane was delayed by several hours, and was prowling the terminal looking for a place to wait/relax/eat. of the many eating choices at the terminal het paleis was by far the best. great ambience, food and drink. prices ok, except for the beer which was expensive. "
"i arrive on saturday during lunch time at grand cafe restaurant. during this time, waiters are supposed to run everywhere and be busy. as i will have a long flight, i decide to have a good lunch and i always wanted to go to grand cafÃ© as i often travel trough schipol airpo "
the worst burger at the highest price (20â¬) and with the slowest service (50 mins). very nice job. just because its in the airport and people come and go... if this kind of sub specie of restaurant was in any town of the world the number of clients would be zero. 
rude waiters with an attitude problem. slow service. i will have a beer elsewhere next time. i suggest other do that same.
food was ok. service was slow for an airport restaurant. waiter rude. but less stressed than food court. probably better to eat land side.
had dinner with friends. service was efficient and the food tasted good. the ribeye steak was well prepared and tender. dish lacked a good sous.
was asked to take a table. the waitress too ages to arrive by which time it was too late to order.  on top of that almost all the other places to eat were closing and wouldnt let us in. appalling.
more than ok if you adjust your expectations to the environment where youre in. service was fast and friendly. sufficent choice for a wide public.even the setting is ok and makes you forget youre only at an airport.
the restaurant is roomy and the interior of the restaurant is much above averag 
"this looked like a nice restaurant, but admittedly not particular impressive. the service was slow (the waiters simply had to much to do), the food the usual dutch style food without to much taste. we thought we had plenty of time but a the end we did not as we waited an unusual long time for the food from the kitchen. doubtful i will be back."
"as soon as we stepped foot in the cafe the staff were instantly rude as we asked if they had english menus. when we was ready to be served the lady completely ignored us. slow service for drinks. once our order arrived it wasnt pleasant for the eyes. both our dinners were cold and dont taste very nice. unfortunately we had to pay for food we didnt eat! not impressed!! over priced, rude, horrible place.. dont go !!!! "
"second time through the airport and thought we would try something different from our prior stop. our breakfast meals were average at best. it was quite a bit more expensive than the mediterranean sandwich shop next door. what it did offer was a more private dining experience. if you have the time to sit around for a while you might enjoy it better than next door, otherwise i would stick with the mediterranean place. "
"food nothing special, but could have worked for hungry tummies if it wasnt for the extremely poor service. all waitresses pouted and were not interested in our orders. when orders were delivered some of the sides were missing and they found it sooo annoying to go get it that they lied and said they didnt have any (other waitress supplied later at our request). would not recommend and will not return."
"if i have a stop over at schiphol with a connection to an eu city, i like to stop for a broodje kroket at  het paleis. the service is not always great, the food maybe not what you want/ like as an international traveller, but as a dutchman its like coming home, kroket & beer. decent breakfast as well. last time, august 16, i got good service. but again nothing compared to us standards, unfortunately. ( dutch people: it is the last ( or first) resort) to eat kroketten or bitterballen once you passed customs. i dont think there is a place to order this in the international area at schiphol. cheers and enjoy"
"went here for food before flying home and left most of my food.on the plate. i got ham and cheese.melt with chips. chips were cold and tasteless and toastie seemed dry. my boyfriend enjoyed his bitterballen. waiter wasnt very friendly.and threw our.cutlery at us, wasnt impressed.with this.place at all. "
"we have had good and poor experiences at this restaurant, it all seems to boil down to the waite "
cold food. overpriced. how can you serve cold chips or cold toasts ?  better go to starbuck and buy a muffin with coffe....
was travelling through schiphol a few weeks back and was delayed for a few hours so ate at the grand cafe. the staff were very warm and friendly and offered advice on the specials etc and the restaurant was extremely busy however every customer got 100% attention. the food was served quickly and was nice and tasty and if i am stuck in schiphol again i will be back.
"abysmal and slow service - their interpretation of caesar salad, by the way, is two lettuce leaves and a pile of cheese and mayonnaise - you would think an airport restaurant would be prompt and attentive but you almost have to trip these waiters as they walk past to get them to stop - if you pay with a credit card, youll have to walk up to the waiter station"
"i cant tell you anything about the cafe/restaurant, because there was no service at all. we waited for about 10 minutes and none of the waiters had time to take our order, even though they saw us sitting and gesturing. i guess we were in no-ones service area. go to bubbles! much better!"
"i did not have the lamb like a previous reviewer but the chicken satay was lifeless with a very salty satay sauce. i also did not appreciate that it has one of the airports smoking areas, an ambiance i would prefer not to have with food. the service however was very professional and friendly and the place had a buzz."
"1 totally disinterested waiter present, engaged with phone, not approachable for simple question. not only me but others aswell"
"i bought two small cheese baguettes, crisps and a bottle of water and it came to 24 euro which was really expensive."
too expensive for what you get. the coffee wasnât good more like hot milk and the staff couldnât tell me what was the flat white or the latte.
"everything seemed tasty with pleasant presentation, the ambience was good and spacious  clean and neat. the staff was friendly and served us efficiently. however the prices are way up there. check prices before you buy."
"i saw a mouse on 3 occasions, i reported the matter to the staff in bread and they informed me there were mice everywhere in the airport  - totally unacceptable"
made a mistake in the price... not eager to fix it and gave back the change in 5cents as a vengeance... top management skills there !!!!  in short avoid !!
"i donât feel the need to add any further details, overpriced and stale. choose anywhere else to avoid disappointment."
"two very average ham paninis on disposable bags, two coffees in paper cups and one small bottle of water with no glass, all for â¬33! part of this was â¬6 for an extra shot in each coffee- that is â¬3 per shot into an already made coffee. also, if you asked for one shot less you did not get a â¬3 reduction. and to add insult to injury the coffee comes out of a push button machine and tastes crap. in the uk âbreadâ is slang for money- the name sums them up well. donât bother eating here."
"departures in schiphol is limiting for coeliacs. i was delighted to see this time that bread has gluten-free options. choice of ham or cheese sandwiches. alongside all of the nice and appetising looking normal sandwiches, the pre-packaged gf sandwiches looked weak. i went for cheese and was more disappointed than first impressions prompted. the bread was nice but a single slice of cheese and nothing else in the sandwich just made it a soggy disappointment. all the more frustrating as you got the bread right. just pure thoughtless not putting a proper filling inside. "
"40 euro for a ceaser salad , packet of crisps, a sandwich, a tea & a coffee! realise airport food is almost always over priced but thats just nuts! food nice and fresh but come on guys....thats just a rip off!!"
"pretty perfunctory offering here when you scrutinise it.....sandwiches are fresh and attractive and cold drinks nicely displayed on crushed ice, other than that rather underwhelming, expensive with somewhat indifferent service. itâs an airport so pretty much what you see is what you get!!"
i stopped here for lunch prior to my flight as it was located just past the exit of security. the selection of products was more limited than i expected but i was able to find a warm filled baguette to eat. the food was expensive but i had come to expect that in an airport (10 euros for a baguette and soft drin 
the food was good but staff ignore dirty tables. i was wiping mine and the staff member looked and kept on walking. every table piled with crumbs.
"tried a sandwich with egg mayo, bacon and avocado. it was really tasty and a good snack whilst waiting for my plane."
"the tables and chairs were covered in spills that had clearly been there for a while. when i asked the waiter to clean up, he wasnt sure where to find what he needed. after a long while he emerged with a wet towel. no disinfectant. im not sure hed ever wiped a surface before. he seemed new to the concep "
similar to pret a porter starbucks costa but not quite as good  service was slow and not well organised  panini was plain compared to others
bread as hard as a rock. two stars given as  staff swapped my boyfriends coffee as he accidentally put in pepper instead of sugar
"somewhere to stop for a light bite when in the airport. managed to get breakfast for 4 people for less than 40euros. the sandwiches at ok, nothing special. a nice cup of black coffee"
thought it would be good for a quick sandwich whilst passing through the airpo 
"waiting for our flight i purchased a coffee and cake, nothing special, food a bit bland, then i tried the fresh orange which was a bit tarty instead of the usual sweet.  needs market research to improve, ok if in a hurry though."
not worth going to. its a very busy place but didnt find the food good at all. nothing special. would have rather gone to mcdonalds.
i was very disappointed with the service at bread! the coke which i purchased was overpriced and had more water pumping into it than actual coke. also the hot chocolate we were given was just an empty cup with a sachet in it which was very weak and was not worth the money as it was very bland and felt like a low budget product.
"rude staff member , unhelpful , i would not  spend my hard earned money at this establishment again , i would go to the many other eating place where the staff treat you like a person and not an inconvenience ,"
"whilst i appreciate that 8am on a monday morning is rush hour, there is no excuse to put the slowest server on the tills and then not do anything about  "
"the fact that youre in amsterdam doesnt make a difference. if youre not picky about your food sitting out on the counter, or have a delicate palate, then this is an ok place to grab a bit "
"this place is okay for a quick bite, just dont expect great taste or reasonable prices! we had two glasses of orange juice, a caprese baguette, and a croissant. the orange juice was fresh and lovely and the only saving grace, because the bill certainly wasnt!"
"by far, this was the worst piece of pizza ive ever eaten.  it had absolutely no taste.  the tuna fish sandwich was just as bad.  try some other place in the airport to eat!"
"small bacon & egg sub - â¬6.25, 2 x juices - â¬11.50, small bottle of water â¬3.15. are your eyes watering? yes, its overcharging time at schiphzl airport! average fast food at top restaurant pric "
"youre flying from terminal h at schiphol - theres little to choose from in terms of food. the selection at bread looked tired, wilted or just over-cooked. the only item that was enjoyable was the green smoothy which was a blend of vegetables. i will give bread a miss on the next time through schiphol."
picked this place for breakfast from among the many choices at schiph 
classic overpriced airport fare. tastes okay. got two sandwiches and soft drinks for eur20. wont rush back any time soon.
had breakfast just now. simple bread preparations . nothing to shout about. no fancy ingredients. good choices of juices. vegetarian options available.
"i travel a lot and therefore i am used to the stupid prices at airports, however this place ranks as one of the worst for value for mon "
"no good for people having bread diet... plenty of panini, sandwich, toast, pizza kind of things... fresh juices are also available.."
ideal for a sandwich or snack but they dont appear to have enough staff to clear the tables when the place is busy
"schiphol airport is currently undergoing refurbishment work, so some restaurants have closed/relocated. looking for somewhere with space, i came across bread downstairs in lounge 3. as its name suggests, it specialises in bread - sandwiches, paninis and pizza. ingredients were fresh, but there was a wait to pay, tables werent cleared and the cutlery bins were not replenished. however when i asked staff for cutlery, they were quick to fetch it. you can access schiphol free wifi here."
"yes, they serve bread at bread!. nice, gimmicky decor. our paninis were okay, almost tasty. the plates were weird, gimmicky. all in all we might grab a panini here again. the service/checkout was kind of slow, but on a trip with layovers, who really cares..."
"the food was good, with quick service. but when i asked for more knives and forks - you need a metal one for pizza - i was waved to a second location. there were none there either."
"if you really have to eat at schiphol airport this is one of the best choices. nice sandwiches, pizza slices and panninis."
absolutely disgusting service. i 
nice and smiling service from a lady with beautiful nailsâ¦but the croissant was average and so was the coffee. for a ristretto priced at 4.95euro you should make an effort !
donât go here - hot chocolate is not really a chocolate but milk with bitter non-dissolvable particles. the tables are dirtyâ¦
"waiting for our flight, lets have some good coffee. nope, dirty tables, floors, poor service, no water with the espresso, no chocolate. no pride in their work. and very expensive. will not return here..."
"had a csppuccino here while waiting for my flight. i know in airports everything is expensive, even if this coffee (5,70 â¬) is more expensive than other airports, this is not the main probl "
"my wife and i had a layover here and wanted a quick break and snack. we selected ham sandwiches after a bit of confusion at the cafeteria-like front end. they have a very nice and quiet dining area in the back away from the hustle of the airport, although some people that arrived after we did had a hard time getting a seat. they also had a wield little mystery scent row of atomizers on the wall, and some people were blocking the hallway to the dining area as a result. two sandwichs and drinks were $29, a bit on the high end, but nice to catch a bit of quiet in-between flights."
a fruit bowl of 20 pieces is $8. coffees are > $10. taste is below average ... big no !! service is good but premium on food is not worth
"a place is only as good as every bit of item in its menu. in this case, their croissants and coffee are very  average. they should stick to what they do best - chocolates."
"i last tuesday while i was waiting for my flight i bought tre small pieces of the block of chocolate that they have at the counter. it was very goog looking and expensive too (5 â¬ / 100g). it was also the nastiest milk-chocolate we have ever tasted in our life! the chocolate tasted like soap, perfume or some kind of old make-up. because my flight was already aboarding it was unfortunately too late to turn around and go back to the store to complain about it. my advise to all of you that are tented to buy their chocolate: taste before you buy! it is not only expensive, it is also discusting!"
enjoyed this cozy spot in schipol. the dark chocolate drink really hits the spot in the bleary early morning after crossing the pond. brightens the morning!
"do not get fooled by the nice appearance. this is not a nice place for a coffee and cake. the coffee is nothing special, and the chocolate cake is not worth a try. even worse; the cutlery was dirty, here were hear in the cake. starbucks which is just 50 meters from cafe chocolate is a far better choice!"
"too slow. we left the queue. only a few people in front of us, but we never saw such pathetic personnel. how much walking to and fro can you do for a cup of coffee?"
"i wanted a hot chocolate, i therefore ordered their specialty hot chocolate... only to discover that its some not too hot milk with a chocolate block insid "
"i paid 8.25eur for one of the worst sandwiches of my life. i had a omelette-bacon sandwich that was clearly rewarmed because the bacon had that distinct rancid, soaked dog hair taste. absolutely terrible."
"just a few figures to explain my bad opinion: a cold piece of pizza for 9.25â¬, a dry tosti ham/cheese for 8â¬.no possibility to hear it (even in their kitchen) and employees just busy talking together.... but unlike all the other restaurants in the country, this one is open . "
"perhaps for an airport restaurant, the prices are appropriate but the food offered is just mediocre. we didnât find the staff the least bit friendly but rather indifferent. not a good experience at all"
worst place in an airport that i have ever eaten. the sandwich was stale â i threw it out after one bi 
"had a dried warm panini, water and a fresh smoothie. costed nearly 16 euros.  the panini was overcooked from staying hot. i saw the lady throwing them all away after it sold me mine."
the quality of the food was good but we bought a quinoa salad placed in a bowl of a size that make you think that contains a good quantity of food and then you realize that the bottom was raised/deformed so contained much less portion. the supervisor said that they had run out of smaller containers ..
rip off  way to expensive 7euro for a panini .coffee 4euro .    the only value was a banana for 1euro...
"terrible food. very expensive. very unfriendly staff. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone, even my dog."
landed at schipol at 2 in the morning. this cafe didnt have any food except some fruit bowls for 8â¬.
"its not easy to eat at schipol airport without being hit hard by prices. here i could eat a salad with tuna (without onions) and a nice sandwich with jambon and dried tomatoes at an affordable price. bread was not exactly as mediterranean as i expected, but tastes were a plain ok: i dont think that other restaurants offering lasagna at 20â¬ or pizza would have been good enough for an italian traveller. this place is fair enough for a quick pit stop without stomach aches. good."
overpriced terrible food!!! the juices werent fresh ( dispite the fresh juices sign ) and the coffee was awful...
"overpriced, food was as hard as a rock. tasted like it has been there for over a decade. :( would not recommend."
nice seating area to drink and eat. variety in food and drinks offered. the staff was friendly. prices are airport-like.
"ok, i know, this is an airport sandwich bar. but that would suggest they know they can expect lots of people at certain times.  all i can see around me are dirty dishes. this should be handled much better."
"the airport restaurant offers a nice selection of pricy sandwiches, some of those not warm any more once you pick them. the restaurant is located in the middle of schipol airport and offers some of the rare options to seat there. however, the tables are not cleaned properly and the atmosphere is rushy. once youre hungry on your trip definitely an option, but no must to be."
"awful, even when accounting for the fact its in an airport. the paninis we had were terrible, completely without taste and of course overpriced (airport prices). the eating area was more concerning though as it was filthy, just filthy. the floor was covered in bits of food scraps and was sticky underfoot. the tables and chairs were dirty and the tables were also very sticky. a cleaner wiped down one of the benches holding the cutlery and its condition was worse afterwards as the rag he used was old and dirty and made the bench smell rotten. i find it hard to believe that schipol airport allows such a dirty place to operate."
"tasteless panini tomato mozzarella, asked for small fresh (seems bottled) kiwi/orange with a sigh and a look like i was asking for a million dollars, walked away ... too much staff very busy with themselves .. amsterdam scene totally not interested in guests (if existing at all for them) so many other places here!"
my wife and i grabbed lunch here on our layover in amsterdam. we each got a salad and split a sandwich. the crowds were not heavy during our visit so we managed to find a table and eat without much pressure. we were satisfied with our lunch selections. prices were reasonable for airport food.
"but, at schiophol, its not only airport food. near this restaurant you can take the escalator to the domestic section of the terminal gates (the high number gates on d). just outside d3/d59 (the same gate, btw) youll find a nice outdoor lounge area. enjoy your airport food there. it tastes a little better."
disregarding the outrages prices (airport) this is a bad place to eat for many reasons. labels of the foods are wrong or food is put at the wrong place in the buffet. almost half of the tables are vacant but not cleaned. staff is unfriendly and they dont care. huge long queues. mozzarella panini that i had tasted like nothing! just terrible.
okay for a quick coffee and sandwich. difficult to get a seat so prepare to wait. the coffee is not the best but the sandwiches was pretty good actually.
awful food for simple sandwiches during a business trip at schiphol airport. very poor sandwiches even if coocked. i tried even lasagne pasta and the taste was awful.do not repeat. service quick and place clean.  price average.
"i ate here twice in november and december. having a three stage flight one gets to feel stale and tired in need of an uplifting eating experience. the decor is good and i was drawn by the name meditarranean as i live close to the med and am used to a lovely fresh diet there. many people are in transit here and have endured the best that in flight catering can offer, so when you land you hope to have aomething fresh and tasty. the food is reasonable but a lot of it is bread based and didnt have the zestiness i was seeking agter stale hours of flying and hanging around aiports. on my second visit i had a tuna salad which was very uninspiring, lettuce leaves, tuna and some very greasy olives. fruit juice was very expensive. its ok but i vowed to find something better on my next trip. i found it. see my review for bubbles."
"i had one of those 16-hour layovers when it is too little time too late to go anywhere, but too much time to spend at schiphol. as i was sitting on a chair in front of this sandwich place, first one then two mice caught my attention. i decided, with a shudder, that i am not going to eat any of those luscious looking sandwiches. by the way, other than the mice, they did not have much to eat there anyway until early in the morning, when the mice, understandably, become invisib "
"probably my(our) most frequently visited restaurant at schiphol. seems generelly fresh and of good quality. a few different sandwich options to choose from that should satisfy most people. has also become something of a tradition to get a muffin here, though i think these are made elsewhere and the same you might find different places around the airport. sometimes pretty (too) crowded."
"i had a long wait between to flights, so i went in to this sandwich bar and took a tasty tuna salad with an italian beer. good choice.  friendly staff."
"grabbed a couple sandwiches and drinks for my flight. not expensive. easy in and out. i had the pane serrano and the pan mozzarella, both of which were good."
"2 cappuccino, 2 sandwiches, 2 panini...â¬35,- this is a selfservice restaurant, no a la carte. better to sit nextdoor at the a la carte restaurant. same prices, better service."
"breads are delicious, but due to the layout, before you have picked everything you need and paid, it takes forever to complete the process."
"the sandwiches are ok. its stupid slow set up if you are busy. it takes forever to get through. the handing of trays, glasses, suitcases sucks.  the only reason we keep coming back are one thing.... they have the best cheesecake ever!"
"we had a lengthy layover in the amsterdam airport. there are not many options for food, but we chose this place since it looked better than the other options. the sandwich i had was better than i expected and my wife said the same. in general it is an average sandwich although for a typical airport one, it was a little better than most. my recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport, but if you have to eat at this airport, it is a slightly above average place. "
"this terminal doesnt have good food options. the mediterranean sandwich bar is the healthiest option. i had a smoked salmon sandwich. it was fresh and tasty. in terminal 1 you can find better restaurants, i highly recommend the dutch kitchen."
"1 of 2 beers ordered tasted flat and the gemengdbittergarnituur (âsnack plateâ) was a disasterâ¦ fried everything including braunschweiger!? which really shouldnt, i can now say, be deep fried."
what a sulky english speaking lady who was not interested at all to welcome us at this restaurant. family with 4 we left without even ordering.
"i would have had something to eat here but the three grumpy men put me right off!  talk about long faces, unhelpfulness and poor service just put me off deciding to stay after my drink.  the food looked average anyway."
"this was a sit down place in the schiphol airport mall area. limited menu. we were hoping for dutch pea soup but server was abrupt and said it was only served in winter so had an only fair tomato soup with meatballs. our two entrees, ham and cheese sandwich and toasted cheese sandwich were just ok."
"stopped for a short bite to eat, looks nice but is very noisy insi "
service wasnt great but did eventually get served. i asked for a medium well steak as the menu was quite limited. i specifically said no blood....see picture! all grilled food is done at a separate restaurant across the way which is weird. not cheap either!
"we visited here on our return flight and took a seat, the waiter an older gentleman served everyone round us, we spoke to him a couple of times and he just ignored us so after 15 minutes we left without being serve "
"located at the end of the airport, this bar is a god option to have a drink before a flight, or if you are waiting for somebody to arrive as well. the selection of beers is a bit small, and the food menu is very basic, the food is good, but you can find better options around."
"we were starving and wanted a quick meal. we ordered hamburgers, fries, tea and cok "
"this is more of a pub than a cafe. they sell a lot of beer and some food (which they periodically run out of). waiters are rather unmannerly bordering on rude - but they befit the place they service, especially if you sit and watch the types walking into the bar for a pint. so, if you like the burly, rowdy style for a loud get-together of ole-boys, this place is for you. if you want to take a girl out on a date - find something more elegant. and definitely no children."
"tasteless apple pie, cold server that acted like we were interrupting him and he was doing us a favor, altho the follow up server, a woman, was very nice.  dont go there, not worth the time or the money."
"stopped for light lunch at the airport.  poor quality sandwich compared to other cafes.  two slices of cheese on a hamburger roll, not what you would expect in the netherlands"
"better than par airport restaurant. limited menu, but good basic food. the waiter was super friendly, funny and attentive."
"i dined here with 2 friends before a flight, and the restaurant was out of many things on the menu.  the help were not very friendly."
"food really bad, the steak was so small could not believe it. quality very bad and price way too expensive for the quality and quantity. will not come back."
"wanted to get a drink before flying out. place looks nice and thought id give it a try. had to wait 10 minutes to get the attention of the staff, then waited another 15 before giving up on my order for coffee and jui "
"whoever your chef is, the aussie or brit, i cannot fully get the accent when they swear, do your staff and yourself a favour and fire him. your food should be edible, food is edible as well."
"kitchen staff completely lost with over 30 mins wait with around 20 tables seated. cashier/ staff attitude rude, unpolite and aggressive. if they are unable to run the place they shouldnât do so"
even though itâs in airport it is expensive. staff are friendly and chatty though. didnât try food but beer was nice.
"lacking in vegetarian options no milk alternatives, vegan forget it! slow service, had to wait some time to pay."
terible service! do not choose this restaurant. the food took very long time and was golf. we complaint but the waiter was teribly rude. never again
several places to eat or drink at schiphol whilst you wait. this is a decent enough place to stop. reasonably priced and fairly comfortable. i like to try a couple of places whilst i wait. this was ok but nothing special.
the architecture is very nice. the prices are high as usually at the airports.   the big advantage are the opening times. even very early in the morning you can have something to eat or drink.
"the food was really big portions and it was worth the price paid. the service needs to be a bit more attentive to new customers, as they seem to just wonder round and cannot distinguish easily new customers. saying that, the service was welcome, smiley and very quick in bringing the food and coffees out. "
waited for 20/25 minutes before someone came and took my order. had to ask for a menu for a few times before i received  
nice coffee but incredibly poor and inattentive service. breakfast was slapped on the table with little attention. disappointed.
"the plaza is directly outside the arrivals hall of schipol, and above the railway platfor "
"had the lunch special which was a small soup and a grilled sandwich with goat cheese. i thought that was very good and i love goat cheese. i asked for a âglassâ of water, and ended up with a tiny bottle. this is the european way of charging you for water and i figured that was on me but i was still surprised when that tiny bottle was â¬3.25. outrageous. "
always rude staff! have tried to eat there  a few times and they always say that a part of the chowded restaurang a close so they dont can have more guess.  choose another place!
had a craving for a hamburger and theirs wasnt bad at all....that and a bloody mary made an airport lunch pretty ok...service was stressed at best and we were ignored. place is short staffed for all the tables being filled.
you would never know that this hopping place was so bad with service. it is hard enough to find a spot to sit. once you do it may take a while to get noticed for your order to be taken. 3.20 for coffee that is good. ordered an additonal espresso. long wait. the redeeming factor for this not so grand is the chance given to people watch a little longer. prices reflect the captive schiphol travell 
"after a long waiting time and remarkable skills of the waiters to avoid contact with the guests, it became finally clear that the waiting time for food was about an ho "
great place to eat and meet. i didnât experience the poor service that others have complained abo 
iâm here right now waiting for 15 minutes and nobody came take my order. and i canât get nothing on the bar.
"a club sandwich can mean a variety of things, my experience at around 17:00 on sat april 28th was quite extraordinary bad! bread - ice cold, slightly toasted - yesterday? bacon - ice cold, hard and extremely dry - with texture of old shoe leather! chicken - some small and again ice cold and dehydrated white pieces of flesh that could have been chicken, or just about anything else... 100% taste-free! in addition to this, some green fragments of an undetermined vegetable - and in between all this, a few white, soft, cold pieces of something unclear if it was remains of an egg, or some kind of sour cream based substance. this meal was totally disgusting - and should have been returned to where it came from, the fridge or rather the wastebin! but the waiter vanished - so there was no-one there to address! when i made the order, i asked for some sparkling water, but she claimed they didnt have it (!) - and she told me something about dont ask me why - so she may have feared i would through the so-called club sandwich at her, so she disappeared... wisely enough..."
"after queuing up for 15 minutes to get a table in the only restaurant where you get served at schiphol airport that i could find,i was told that there is a waiting time of 30 minutes for any food. this is not acceptable for an airport restaurant.why not telling me that while waiting? "
"i was there to await and arrival. i sat down and was approached rudely in an unprofessional manner. the menu was very greasy and over-used. the prices indicated on the photographed menu are very high for dutch standards, â¬ 4,10 is an outrageous high price for a standard draft beer in amsterdam. therefore all in all not a good representative service and price for amsterdam customs."
stopped in the arrivals area and have lunch comprising of a smoothie and an italian burger. the burger had  mozzarella and pastrami and overall pretty good.  smoothie was just like fruit juice so not really thick.
"ordered ribeye with veggies and baked potato, arrive colder than my beer, waitress agreed, sent it back, arrived back a few moments later luke warm.   very nice staff hence the one star....but terrible food"
"on a transit through amsterdam airport, so forced lol, to have a drink, good choice of wines and food, stuck to just a glass of wine, service was pretty hopeless, barstaff despite having the technology still walked around auctioning drinks!"
"dreadful service. rude, got order wrong and waited forever to be served. bland overpriced food. avoid ."
"i often wonder why airport restaurants are so bad. is it because they think that they have a captive market and no one would come back anyway? anyway, not great food, terrible service - the older man that served us was entirely useless and clueless - and exorbitant prices meant that we will definitely not be back."
i have visited here 5 times but have only been served twice. tonight i walked out for the third time after 15 minutes. just cant get served absolutely the worst service i have ever seen
"if you would like to destroy your whole journey, you can visit this pla "
"the service is excrutiatingly slow - you get ignored until you raise your voice, and then you are served huffily. the place is clearly understaffed so it would be better if the staff kept their conversations witheach other shorter, and paid more attention to the customers - and it wasnt particularly busy. prices are standard for amsterdam, but if this was not at the airport, they would go bust very fast. odours of old cooking oil wafting from the kitchen convinced us to rather eat elsewhere."
"even by airport standards this place is substandard.  too hot inside to sit at regular table, and patio tables were tiny.  food was eatable, but that is about all.  obtaining and paying bill was a chore."
"after eating local food hoping for good food. was more like thawed food microwaved. fries were bit dark, older shortening. pork was tiny. bit pricey but at airport expected. ok for on the go."
the service: the service could be better. we were waiting for a waiter or waitresses for at least 15 minutes and it was not bu 
"service was poor, place wasnt that busy, had to call over a waiter numerous times. had our 76 year old father with us, he was using a trolley to lean on as we walked around the terminal, it was left near our table to use again as we were leaving and a waitress came over and was rude and asked us about the trolley as it was in the entrance way and it wasnt, it was next to our table. we ordered a toasted ham and cheese sandwich to be rudely told it was only available until 5pm. food quality was good but none of the staff were helpful, when we asked for bill, was rudely told to go the register to pay. wouldnt go back."
we kind of expect more from schiphol and this place was ok but not much more.  a competent menu but wait staff seem distracted and certainly not into customer service.....why bother when youll never see most of your customers again?
"limited menu with burgers, some salads and pasta. quality of food ok but absolutely not more. ordered a salmon and asparagus salad but got no asparagus. when we told the waiter we got some more salmon but they were out of asparagus. its that kind of place if you see what i mean. "
not a wide range on the menu but cooked to order. a little pricey but it is what you would expect for an airport.
"likely not having a lot of returning customers ive had bad experience here twice or three times already. staff is very busy chatting to each other, instead of earning the overpaid prices for food and drinks here. if they finally found the way to your table, you better order while you can as they dissapear again to chat with their colleagues if you dont decide fast enough. pay 19,- for a basic burger and some fries. for 21,- you are eating a quality meat burger at the restaurant of the hilton hotel, with in the lobby a nice spacious and quiet bar for short business meeting for example. just avoid this place, not worth it. the only value it has is its location at the arrivals."
"this review is of the grand cafe plaza, situated in the main shopping concourse near the entrance to terminal 3. (some of the photos show a different grand cafe het paleis "
"the cappuccino tasted like hot tap water, no quality at all. it looks like it was made by a bad automatic machine. very disappointing."
the 20 euro dutch burgers were tasty and fulsome and the heineken beer was suitable chilled but equally overpriced. chips on the cold side but otherwise ambience is good and service pleasant and efficient. it is a good spot for keeping an eye on the queues at passport control if you are in transit.
very quick servi 
i had coffee here after dinner. the coffee was average. the service average. good place to sit and watch the passing parade.
good for an airport cafe. dont expect too much. it is not a gourmet restaurant as some people expect....where do they go to travel? it can be busy but it is a nice place to while away a hour or two.
"ordered a dutch entrecote. a) portion was tiny for 20 euro b) the grilled veg were 90% onions, and a few slices of zucchini and green beans. c) the piece of meat was awful - about 25% of it was a chunk of fa "

to meet friends and to rest after arrival or before departure.  the location is right next to the gwk tax forms on the arrival floor.  its easily found and the price is cheap.  they have sufficient menu for small meals and drinks.
i used to go here regularly for the fantastic chicken satay. throughout the last years the service has decreased to the point that last i visited i waited for about 25 minutes without getting a menu or the waiters attention... individuals around me faced similar service... i was forced to leave. adieu grand cafe!
"this cafe is on the right spot. easy to find. just when you arrive, take your luggage and walk through exit :) food is also great. we had hamburger and chicken wings. staff are friendly. this is a good place to chill when you arrive and before your departure."
"the place was having a really bad day-- the card reader was down so they could take cash only. however, that does not excuse eggs, sausage, and bacon served cold or tea water so tepid that it was unable to brew tea. and, when asked what kind of tea we wanted, we said earl gray at the urging of the staff. we got something else. while i understand they were having issues, the food and tea could have been served hot, especially given the large size of the staff on the floor."
"theres nothing grand about this cafe, but its one of the few real restaurants at the airport. we had lunch there on arrival as its the most convenient place to go. however if you are hungry and want fast service this might not be a good choice as we waited for almost 30 minutes for a hamburger. food quality is decent, and price not too unreasonable. best thing about it is you can sit there and watch the world go by in the arrival hall and be entertained."

"least bad choice of restaurants in b/c piers  waiting staff make it clear youre there to order food and to be quick about it. quality of the food is distinctly average - price-wise however very high, even for european airports."
"after 20 minutes of sitting and being utterly ignored i came to the counter and asked the waiter how long would i wait. wait for what? was his resolute answer... he came to our table after couple of more minutes and forced himself to take an order. i asked for sirloin steak to be told that there was no such thing in the menu. when i pointed it using my finger, the reply was oh, that one... then we had a brief discussion on good manners to which he just laughed at me and left our table. few minutes later a lady waitress came to... take our order! to my remark that the order has just be taken she replied that there was nothing on the computer. at that point we left to never come back to this horrible place. "
"nothing special, just airport quality. dont expect hospitality and feed yourself. why cant airport restauarant offer more?"
"plenty of food but as usual, expensive because you are at the airport.  wide choice of foods on the menu.  something for everyone."
"good space, east to sit wth luggage, english menu, ok selection, nice draft ever, seated quickly, waitress came up quickly ordered drinks said shed be back for our food order. did not return, asked another water if he could take our order, he said no had to be our waitress and he would send her. that didnt happen, eventually flagged down another waiter he took our order no problem. so good, but insistent service"
"while the food was average, both waiters i eventually was in contact with, made little effort to conceal what a annoying burden i added to their day by utilizing their services. i generally have a fairly relaxed attitude to the level of service, but this is one of the very few places to which i will never return."
"the food is average, even for an airport.  the service was good, speedy and friendly.  the price was 13.95 for a burger, fries and a beer which i was charged for twice! - check your bill...."
"after our flight we wanted to grab a bite before going home. after 5 minutes we ordered our food. 15 minutes went by and still no good or drinks! what made the long waiting worst was that people who came in later got their drinks earlier then we did. we will never go there again. the place is clean and nice, the food is good. "
"had an evening meal, which was quite ok, even though the meat could have been more tender. the service was slow though and far from impressive. overall good value, but service leaves room for improvement."
"good wines per glass, menu shows quality but still the dishes need to be cooked with care. all my requests were granted but i prefer to eat without need to ask."
"i had dinner at otium, the restaurant at the radisson blu. it was pretty good. i had the chicken supreme which is a chicken breast with with an asian sauce, bok choy and udon noodles. the flavor was good however the chicken had quite a bit of skin and fat and was a little rubbery. it wasnt bad, but not great eithe "

"i had a conference in the hotel, and i hesitated going to amsterdam. you can pay 70â¬ for a taxi (20 min), or take the shuttle (free, every 20 min) back to the airport and then the train (8â¬, 30 min), and then transport to where you need to go. not worth  "
"went to the otium restaurant when staying in the hotel recently. i was quite hungry so ordered from the main courses the chicken with potatoes and vegetables - i believe it was â¬24. when it came it looked like a childs portion - a small chicken brest, 1 carrot, one small piece of broccoli and 2 small potatoes. i finished it in about 5 minutes and was still hungry so ordered so ordered some bar finger food. what i had was nice but they are charging â¬24 for presentation so it was very poor value. i could have easily eaten double the amount, so if your hungry go elsewhere."
my husband and i had dinner here the night we stayed. for the price i really expected better quality. i had a filet or at least that is what i ordered. it was unlike any filet ive ever had. it looked like a filet but it was tough and not very tasty. the texture reminded me more of a club sirloin.
"this restaurant feels like its trying to join the big boys with terms like sous vide and smoked potato foam on the menu. we selected truffle risotto which was properly cooked but absolutely tasteless. there were tiny flecks of something brown in the dish, but it might as well have been sawdust for all the flavor it added. even the shaved parmigiano cheese and the bits of asparagus in the dish didnt manage to add any taste."
"we stopped in while staying at a nearby hotel, the park inn. i had the risotto with truffles which was cooked correctly but the broth was not boiled down properly and so it was soupy. i complained and the friendly waitress asked if i needed anything and suggested a free salad. her kindness was appreciated. with the risotto and a plate of cheese divided with my colleagues and part of a bottle of wine, i paid 31 euro."

"staying at the radisson blu there isnt much option than to eat at otium, and although its not great value-wise i had a decent dinner."

"i came here because the radisson park inn hotel kitchen is closed on sundays, and they advised to come here, since it is hosted by the radisson blue hotel. i just wanted to have dinner, possibily without having to go bankrupt. i decided to take a quail salad: it costed about 12 â¬, and it was a portion so small it could have been ok for my 2 years old niece. just to give a term of comparison, for 10.50 â¬ at the radisson park inn you can have a chicken salad, which turns out to be better both in quantity and in quali "

"ate solo in the bar area. food was good if a little on the pricey side, but not excessive for an airport hotel.   sadly getting attention of waiting staff was painful, nice people but not attentive"
"the food is very overpriced for what it is - take 50% off and youd be in the ballpark. food was very plain and bland. even the burger (well done/no blood) came out with raw meat, they were reluctant to cook it more and all they did was sear the part showing and when bitten into it was still raw. even with very few patrons, they took ages to do anything including bringing the bill which had no discount despite not eating the uncooked me "
"i was staying at the steigerberger airport hotel due to a missed connection at ams, and the airline included dinner with the room. it was a sunday and only the bar was open. i had a chicken sandwich, which was ok. when i gave the server my voucher for the free meal she got a little upset because apparently one can only get certain items off the menu with the voucher. i explained to her that no one told me that, and her response was, you didnt ask. i guess you can be rude when travelers have no choice. if id arrived earlier in the day if you have time, take the train into amsterdam and eat at one of the many excellent restaurants there."
i had a meal here while staying at the steigenberger hotel. the burger i had was tasty but the price was quite expensive (â¬22). theres not really any other options though so youre stuck here for food unless youre driving.
"food is ok and the staff are very friendly, this is however the only option if you stay in tha steigenberger hotel over the weekend."
i walked from airport to avoid eat some âairport foodâ and following the hotel ranking. i tasted the salmon that was delicious but the servi 
"nice place, pretty good food. watch out for the recommended for two persons menu item. itâs way not enough for two (price is, quantity isnât) the extra burger was needed to complete the meal."
"in europe tips are not the main portion of income, but tonight, i dinned alone and another stranger from same country sat alone next to me. we struck an engaging conversation. we converged to 1 table and paid our respective bills while finishing our beverages. we were asked to move to the bar bc they needed to seat others waiting. many empty tables around and waiter, balraj asked us to move to bar area. we did and 12 min laterâ¦still empty seats. as a diamond with hilton, i may switch to marriott bc of serviceâ¦or lack there ofâ¦"
front of house service was brusque and off hand when we asked to be moved from a very large and noisy group area.  took ages to get out 1st course and even longer for the 2nd course. food was bland. a very impersonal experience.
stayed at the hilton the night before our flight home so decided to have dinner here in the hotel. appetizers and entrees were good but nothing special or outstanding. think we could have had just as good a meal or even better at one of the many restaurants in the airport mall and for less money.

"this restaurant is very interesting place to review because it sits in a classification between being clearly preferred and feature restaurant of an international chain hotel and also, perhaps, it wants to have its own identity. having read some of the other reviews on this site, i was expecting the food to be stronger than it was based on my two opportunities to eat he "
"i ate dinner here earlier this week during a layover at the hilton schiphol airport (this is their on-property restaurant). overall, its a great restaurant with lovely food, a nice atmosphere, and seats where you can watch the chefs/cooks do their thing. id easily increase my rating to 4-5 stars if it werent for our server, niki. i say server because she only visited our table 4 times during the evening; to bring us menus, to re-fill our water, to bring the dessert menu (which we had no interest in given her poor service) and to bring our bill. i will say hats off to the rest of the team, who took our orders and brought our meals, as well as checked on us to ensure all was ok. niki did none of these. she was simply horrendous and if you choose to eat here, avoid sitting in her section."
"the bowery is the upscale restaurant of the schiphol airport hotel. it serves expensive but very good quality lunch and dinner dishes. using high quality and local sustainable ingredients. regrettably during a busy lunch hour it was seriously understaffed leading to the ball being dropped ... cutlery forgotten, food coldish, slow with the bill. atmosphere also a bit unrelaxed with many conference lunch eaters coming and going. staff managed to remain friendly despite the pressures. "
we both went for the asian menu selection. i had the beef and my friend had the sticky chicken both of which were very good. i ordered a bottle of rose - which was very nice but once our glasses were poured the bottle was taken away. it was never topped up unless i requested it from the waiter despite having an empty glass for over 10 minutes. we had almost finished the bottle - about 4cms left in bottom when he took it away and brought us a new bottle. i said i wanted the remainder of our bottle of wine not a new one and he replied that he had thrown it away as they never serve the last drop of wine due to sediment! i have never had this with a bottle of rose. maybe with a red. so i felt we were cheated out of a glass of wine! itâs the principal not the cost. so be aware when ordering wine here. 
as we were stranded passengers we felt slightly segregated from other guests because it was a free service! the food wasnât great compared to the bar food we also had during our stay! was almost like we had âleftoversâ however the food that guests were eating looked amazing as we walked through to our buffet

"had my breakfast here for 5 days. typical same menu every single day. lunch a little variety. really, not impressive at all. the good thing, staff are nice, warm and courteous. "
"the restaurant claims to serve the best burger in town. well.. they dont. if they wanna claim anything, it might be worst burger in town. the burger was hard and rubbery, the tomato and gherkin were almost frozen, the bacon far from crispy and the taste almost chemical. after trying everything separate, it was clear that all products used were far from good. with b-quality its hard to make the best burger. staff was friendly but quite inexperienced. and way too much hassle: unfolding the menu, introducing them selves, asking whether we want the drinks menu on the table or not, the bill in a little tin.... a concept can be nice but this is too much for our taste. we also tried the mushroom croquettes (yuk!), the gyozo and other things and nothing made us very happy. they could do so much better. and with their prices they should do better. "
staff is friendly. food is taste good but a little bit pricey. burger is recommend. please make sure staff is put a right room number on the bill.
food was good but staff attitude poor. at peak times staff tends to be very hectic and forgets many orders if you come with a group of more than 5 people. inattentive and insensitive to customers.
ordered still - gave sparking. ordered medium well - gave rare. but worst - husband ordered seafood bisque - gave some kind of chicken soup instead.... and no takeaway allowed of leftovers if u dont finish - never again 
"whether you dine alone or with a 3 [as i did] it is really comfortable. staff is knowledgeable, wines are tasty and all three starters that we ordered were up to expectation. the main course however was not. the nasi goreng had not enough flavor and was not indonesian enough. too bad, this could be a great dish on the menu. but, there is enough to choose from so hopefully other dishes are more tasteful. for sure a place to return to."
"staff was friendly and welcoming. some issues with the service but nothing serious. food was only average, i honestly was expecting little bit better for the price. pretty standard hotel quality, nothing really wrong with that."
"as other reviewers have noted, service is spotty. it took more than ten minutes to get any drinks on my table. i saw several patrons actually get up from their tables to go ask for their checks. fortunately i brought along something to read. food was ok, but not outstanding. "

"bright (almost too bright), airy and welcoming restaurant in the schiphol hilton. exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. swift, attentive (tending towards too attentive....this is a fine line guys!) service. ate dinner and breakfast here recently. food beautifully presented. dim sum, excellent. nasi goreng very bland. the prawn (tempura style) was rubbery, cold and undercooked. the coating soggy....bit unfair to raise this now since i didnt complain at the time and allow problem to be rectified, but notice this wasnÂ´t an isolated case. breakfast was very good. appreciated those small touches....coffee brought in large thermos....orange juice served and topped up....one of the lovely staff tempted us with warm pancakes brought to table. may i suggest seating larger groups away from couples? we fled a raucous group of men placed next to us. sorry....do not do loud in a morning."

"the food was good, not exceptional. but very convenient, as i was staying in the hotel and the price of the food was reasonable for a 5 star hotel."
"the hotel is very nice and we were looking forward to an equally nice meal after a very long day of international travel. we arrived at 9pm. the restaurant was not busy, but we had to wait ten minutes for a table. that was our first sign that things would not go well. finally, we were seated at a table that was not dressed. a couple who arrived after us, received menus, water and a greeting from a waiter before us. we waited and waited. nothing. after ten minutes, i called over for a waiter. we received menus and had the table set. we quickly decided on our choices, but again, no waiter. he had disappeared. we waited so long that the couple next to us were served bread and their drinks. there is an open kitchen where we watched a frantic chef fussing over dishes. he was expending so much energy, but it seemed misguided due to the bad service and so few tables to serve. i called over the hostess once again so we could order. she took our ordered and explained that there had been a delayed flight and the restaurant was crunched trying to prepare dinner for the passengers. there was a buffet already set up for the delayed flight. it was a poor excuse. our poor service was due to a disorganized staff and lack of professionalism and experience. surly, an international airport hotel should have well trained staff prepared to serve tired travelers. no one comes to the airport just to eat out. everyone there is traveling, jet lagged and wanting to eat and move on. i ordered miso salmon and my husband ordered a hamburger. my salmon sat under a hot lamp for nearly ten minutes while the chef fussed over stylizing plates. the salmon was overly sweet and over cooked. we were so annoyed by the entire experience we couldnt wait to get out of there. we would stay at the hotel again, but not eat at the restaurant."
ok hotel is ok a la hilton bit far from terminal advertised closer its a serious walk all the way at the e 
average breakfast and dinner. good value for price since breakfast is juts 15 euros and you can have continental buffet and fresh made omelet.
"this place is fine if you are staying in the hotel, but i wouldnt recommend it otherwise. breakfasts here were good with lots of options. service was friendly, if a bit disorganised,"
"the quality of the meals was good. i liked tom kah kai. it was a little bit salty though. steak tartar was excellent. my wife ordered asian wrap, which was not the one she expected. the problem is waitresses. they were very nice, but not efficient and not professional. they socialize each other and do not pay much attention to customers. a lady next to us asked for the dessert menu, but nobody came back to take order for 10 min. not surprisingly she just left. they need to be more trained and the ms ages should watch how they are doing for customers. we did not get bread and some au de voir despite the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine."
"this is the restaurant of the hip and fun schipol airport hilton. the interior is modern and trendy, but for some inexplicable reason the waiting staff are dressed as farme "
"i was taken to my table but then ignored for the next 10mins, until i finally got someones attention to provide me with a menu. why dont they leave a menu with you once you reach the table? the codfish had little flavour but the accompanying bread was delicious. disappointing."
"presentation was nice but the taste was very average. service was friendly and efficient. they are still in the startup, do plenty room to improve."
"the host was friendly, took a long time to get a menu and bead provided was really great as was the butter etc this was the go "
"i was intrigued by the write up about this restaurant, so i asked for a seat where i could watch the kitchen in action. interesting, but didnt see all that much. while steady business, i was most disappointed with poor service. i waited at least 15 minutes for my plate to be cleared and then another 1/2 hour for my server to bring my check! the menu choices are mediocre. the fresh roasted veggies were greasy and underwhelming. would probably take a cab to eat elsewhere next time considering the prices, selection and service. there is an amazing sized hamburger on the menu for the hungry person, though!"
"great food selection on menu, and terrifically cooked. only negative is the very slow wait between courses. fifteen minutes between ordering and soup arriving; then ten minute wait for main course, and then fifteen minute wait to receive dessert (in fact had to remind the staff each time to bring the next course) - all this perhaps because the restaurant (and the hotel itself) are new (opened in december 2015) and still undergoing shake-down."
"we decided to discover bowery for a lunch. the place is nice, with a great decoration and atmosphere. nevertheless the service was a complete disaster! arrogant, unprofessional, more than 40 min to get dishes... bref unacceptable for hilton and a nice moment which turn into a nightmare!"
this really is a pathetic and pretentious place. the worst was the very agressive pushing by the waiter to leave a tip on the credit card. upselling the (good) house wine as if it was something very special was plain silly.
service was mediocre. asked for something light because i was not hungry and got a big heavy slab of mea 
"a bar and restaurant, all mixed together. the resatauant serves simple food and a speciality called the daghap, every monday. food for a low proce."
"we have previously had breakfast/ coffee here and, though the service was often slow, the food was good. today, however, we had no opportunity to sample the food, because we could not find someone who would serve us. when we arrived there were two customers outside and two inside who had already been served, and four tables were still littered with old cups etc. we asked twice for someone to take our order, but no one appeared. after ten minutes and still no service four other tables were occupied - and not served. meanwhile one customer outside who had asked several times for his bill (to no avail) left without paying. we registered our dis-satisfaction to someone who appeared to be in charge, who told us there were problems with their new system, though she and her colleague had been busy with arranging a pretty display and not clearing tables or serving customers. we were at least offered a cup of coffee which we declined. we shall not be returning."
"i went there with my son on a sunday midday to have some lunch. we sat down outside and looked at the menu. there were two waitresses serving the terrace of which one had sat down with some clients (her friends?) and was in a conversation with them. the other waitress took orders at some tables. she passed our table five times without even looking at us. at the sixth time i asked whether we could order something. she replied: âyes, but i am very busyâ, and immediately went inside. again, she did not even look at us. when she came out after another two minutes, she again passed us without paying attention to us... unbelievable. at that point we got up and left. unnoticed by the two waitresses. absolutely uncalled for: what a rude, uninterested, incompetent staff! we live in the neighborhood, but will not be back."
"i have tried on numerous times both pizza and pasta - and sad to say i rather buy frozen ones at albert heijn or make my own - my kids dont eat them, and i must say we have been dissapointed everytime. we wont be back here again at all"
"we went there with the family after a firm forrest walk. the staff was welchmng us very friendly as we arrived with no reservation. the staff presented the menu and the drink were taken. we ordered some starters and some main courses. the starters, a bisque with ginger and the tartar with carpers. then we had some salmon and a venis "

especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"
"lovely dinner, though seated very close together.  menu was nice, good execution, wasnât wowed weâve had a lovely dinner, waiters were nice, all was clean."
"we had the 6 course tasting menu, everything was just pretty much ok, nothing spectacular, nothing to remember. i guess prices are fair"
"the food was good, but the restaurant is very noisy (bad accoustic). the room is small and packed with tables, which makes it less cozy. i had a draft on my neck from the air conditioning."
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the satÃ© was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e very good."
with a guest at restaurant at bomans settled down for an evening me 
"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend â¬120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.
"restaurant is very conveniently located for locals to walk to dinner rather than drive. food of decent quality (but would not use the superlatives i see in other reviews), which for us was what we where looking for. price was on the high side for the achieved level of the foo "
a small restaurant in the middle of the mainstreet of the village. make a reservation. good food list with meals you expect. the meat dish liver is perfect. ask for a table not to close to the entrance.
"very decent lunch platter, very big portions. terrace is nice with shade or sunshine options. service wasnât the quickest, but overall it was okay."
"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staffâs eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying âdat meen je niet!â she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long sheâd like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadnât made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was âoerâ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though iâd ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that heâd promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.
"large restaurant with all you can eat buffets; fish, meat, chnese, etc. temperature so, so. saladbar was ok. drinks are expensive or choos al you can drink for 2 hoursâ¦â¦."
stopped for coffee and pancakes but then had the very embarrassing experience when we came to pay that they didnât accept visa credit or debit. it has to be cash or a dutch bank card! first time after five days in holland we had to get cas 
food and service was very good even the owner of the restaurant came a couple of time to our table to talk with us. in general a good experience only the menu could be a bit bigger with more options.
nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
"its as if the staff walk around actively trying to avoid getting into contact with customers. ive waited for 10 minutes, 3 servers walked by and none of them even said as much as hello. ive walked away from their terrace for the second time in a few weeks now. this used to be a fantastic restaurant. good food, good ambiance. sadly, they seem to have slipped. "
the meat from the grill was very dry and some of the side dishes rather poor. a good feta saganaki and greek lukanica did raise our final opinion
"i come here multiple times a year and usually i enjoy the food. tonight was below anything ive ever seen. i got served a well done steak that should have been rare. i sent it back. the second steak was a pathetic thin piece of meat, that was obviously put straight from the cooler on the grill. it was dead cold. i was the only person in the group who wasnt eating, yet the waitress manages to completely ignore this. she even goes so far as to come to our table to ask if i want anything to drink. about 45 minutes later, when clearing the table she asks was it not to your liking?... no, i always leave my steak untouched on the plate... the chef didnt wish to come because he was too busy with the other 3 tables. i left and i wont come back. "
food is all inclusive as are drinks but is of a poor quality.  our kids had to go out and get takeaway pizza ... golf was fun though!!!!
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25â¬, and salad 9.75â¬. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"we took two burgers on the lunch menu. bad meat, bad bread, almost no salad. non smiling service. not a great place. though it is well located."
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."
"went there for a drink and snack, waitresses very friendly and correct! ordered nacho with guacemole, it came disappointing, hiddious! guacemole came out of a tin, processed rubbish! never seen this before. the ladies toilets stunk. definitely need a good cleanu "
"good place to go for a drink. de brasserie had a central location in emmen, friendly waiters and a lot of beers to chose from."
"ill qualify this review first by saying im irish with a dutch husband well versed in all things irish and particularly fond of a pub of the irish inclination. after moving to emmen we were quite excited to find a local irish pub. so the husband and myself headed out one evening. firstly, the staff are great. friendly, helpful and around just the right amount of time. full marks. waiting staff, these stars are for yo "
food: 3/5 
i asked some vegetarian options among a rubbishy pre set tapas meal. after 45 minutes scouring through random pieces of meat i found 2 meager options. luckily the waiters gave me enough time to find it before being able to serve the next round.
"the restaurant has got a nice terrace and plenty of indoor seating. menu is mainly deep-fried food. the actual cheeseburger i got was greasy, tasteless and rather expensive."
sorry to say this but the food just was not go 
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
i went here a few times. first of all i have the feeling it does not get better. furthermore i dislike the fixed prices. i went here with my pregnant sister and when she wanted to replace the more expensive beef with the much cheaper giros meat (as that is not good during the pregnancy) she was still forced to pay the same. some guests also got a free ouzo but not all.... that is not very nice. all together a rather average experience.
the plates of the main course where full of meat as is normal in greek restaura 
"they say its the best greek in town, but thats not hard with only 2 option "
"nothing special, weve been to worse but weve been to a lot better greek restaurants. we prefer to drive to meppen germany and have Ã  greek meal there, so munch better!"
"well, the title says a lot, doesnt it. perhaps im being a bit negative, but after visiting them 3 times i keep getting the feeling that i should not come again. one time i was there i requested that i would not like a scoop of chocolate ice cream in my trio of ice, but rather have an extra vanilla instead.. i was gobsmacked when they told me that i could only order what the menu said !.. ( still cant get my head around that ) last time i had no choice as the other restaurants were fully booked, so we just sat there outside, waiting for someone to come by.. ....... which took a while... and when someone came, we asked for the menu, ............ which never came, so we collected it ourselves. and after reading that for a kids menu under 12 y.o. the child would have to prove it by an id, thats when i stood up and wen "
"the location in the center of emmen is excellent. nice and cosy restaurant. the food is ok, but not special. service is good."
well its okay but not one of the better restaurants in emmen. there are better options for a lower price.
old outdated restaurant with an outdated menu. we were the only ones in the restaurant and when i ordered a double espresso she gave me two espresso on top of eachother. so that isnt professional at all and the prices are way to high for the food and service you get here.
more a bar then resturant. had carpaccio which was placed on buttered bread. first time eaten that way and i guess there is a reason. it does not work.
"service is average, but nice. food is average nothing more nothing less. competition would be great for this restaurant i presume. asperges were ok but not really good, fries and wine average, everything is average here. i think they are great for large groups and tourists, for great they really have to make a huge step. "
"the usual, standard layout and optio "
place looks well decorated and compared to the past the long cues are solve 
"the food is not well cooked, very few dishes. last time i ate raw potatoes and a disgusting cake. better eat in another place."
visited la place this afternoon 
"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
"well, its not easy to find a vegetarian menu at this place, only coleslaw and corn so my friend took what he needed and we went to another fast food restaurant next door. we came here before the lockdown"
i just came by here at the drive thru for a quick dinner whilst we were sat waiting for the food window we saw 6 pretty big rats running around in the space of 7 minutes 
canât describe the lack of efficiency here. i sat at the table for 1h with my family waiting. what did we order? 4 simple paninis and 2 soups. the amount of people during this hour that decided not to wait and left was impressive (also the trays with drinks brought to empty tables and back into the fridge after being re closed). for our drinks weâonly â needed to wait for 30min. i must say that the food was great. or we were just starvin 
"the croque monsieur was reheated and absolutely dreadful. have been before, but now they have started reheating the food i will never go back"
first of all the menu promised a bread-sommelier to help with the decision on what type of bread would compliment your topping. the only question we got was white or brown and later they came to me that they didnât even had brown bread. and just fyi at this moment there were 5 tables and 4 waiter 
"the first impression was not so good. despite hardly any guests in the cafe there were many dirty, not cleared tables. also one chair at our table was dirty. as we were hungry, we decided to give it a try. we ordered a full lunch with hot meals and drinks plus tap water for the kids. however, the restaurant refused to serve the tap water and came with small bottles for each of the kids. why is unclear: we were spending enough so why no tap water for kids? why wasting bottles if tap water in holland is superb? we did not get a good answer: only âcompany policyâ. the food itself varied from good (salmon, ârundvleeskrokettenâ) to mediocre (pancakes, fish and chips). service was quick. when we paid (unfortunately you cannot pay at the table but need to go to a till) we were very surprised to see that we had to pay â¬0,50 for ketchup. the fries came with mayo, so why not change for ketchup? in conclusion: not a good experience. will not come back. "
we had fish and chips and chicken satÃ©. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"too much pepper in the burger, fries tasted a bit like they were made with old oil, but the spare ribs were juicy and tender. nice outdoor seating."
"we ate good steaks only we received only one serving of french fries instead of two. some people who were alone received one serving of french fries same portion we received. it was not fair. then we finished our food, the waitress came & we asked why only one portion. i forgot what she said. just like discrimination because we were the only brown people that time. she asked if we wanted another portion of french fries. ah ah... what an excuse!...we were finished already. then she asked!!!the place is good & food to "
i ordered take out 2 rib menus. the ribs were extremely fatty and with a lot of bone splinters. the taste of the meat was fine thoug 
"service was good with friendly staffs. starters such as mushroom with cheese, goat cheese, onion soup and smoked salmon, were excellent, they smelled really good. main dish had a reasonable portion. meat was good. fish was tasty. if you arent in a hurry for dinner, this place can be your choice because it takes a bit time to get food delivered to your table."
"we were with the four of us. we told the restaurant we were going to the theater after dinner. we had two hours planned for dinner but after one and half hour we were still waiting for our main course. we told the waiter we were concerned , but that didnt help much... we did make it in time but it was only just."
"we first ordered drink and then lunch. after seeing most of customers got their food, we asked a staff (there were only 2 staffs) about our food. the staff looked blank and said she did not take our orders. unbelievable!!! she looked into her note and found out it was her. it took in total 45 minutes to get lunch. food was delcious though and restaurant looked cozy though. "
"this place offers a 3 course menu with different options for a good price, eur. 14,50. next to the dinner menu they offer an extensive beverage menu with some nice cocktails. the place itself is very nice and attractive however the employees are not service minded at all. as a customer you have to ask them for a menu, ask them to take your order, ask them to clean the table etc. that is sad seeing how beautiful the place is and the potential it has. you can have a nice time there for dinner and lots of fun drinking after your meal but the service doesnt motivate you."
"service in general was fine, altough one of the guys forgot that i ordered an extra beer. but one of the dishes we ordered totally did not match the menu. it should have tomatoes, bascilicum and ..., but it had totally different vegetables and a bell pepper sauce - which was for sure not mentioned. next to that, the dish was super saulty. so we were nit so happy about the food, we did get a discount when we mentioned it though."
"normal bar, trendy inside, but very poor waitering. more then once i ordered my drinks at the bar which they would bring to the table and then waited more then 20 minutes. the bill is also qwuite often a surprise..."
waited a long time to be served. then waited a long time for my drink. when i ordered my meal and second drink it never showed so i just got up and left. visit lelystad regularly for work but wont go here again.
"i very rarely write negative review but this time, i canât resi "
"good service, mediocre lunch offering, better dinner options. nice view over the marina. we were there for lunch and it was rather quiet but i can imagine it is a vibrant place at night when all people from the boats come in for dinner & drinks. should be nice!"
we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.
they probably took a different road for succ 
"the menus are not in english, but that is ok. what i donât think is ok is having a waitress that doesnât help you find out what you want; asking for fresh bread with butter a side and getting roasts and butte "
terrible service. rude with no smile. didnât allow us to order take out from the restaurant or even to see a menu.  charge money for using the restroom â  no vegetarian options.
"this is not fine dining but you can get a decent meal! i had a steak which was oke, the vegetables and potatoes were nice. one of the better highway restaurants that i have been in. they had a busy night, i could tell, but were still quick and friendly. "
"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajÃ©."
"we went to this place for what we thought would be a quick meal. we ended up leaving without having our bite to eat. the cook seemed totally lost! he would look at the orders and just read them over and over again until finally he seemed to understand what he needed to do. and the place wasnt crowded or anything. many people were just having coffee. we dont know if the food is any good, but service is terrible!!!"
"ok pancakes after visiting the batavia ship, or shopping. the service could be better (forgot about one of the dishes), but the pancakes were ok overall, with interesting topping choices. combines an ice cream shop."
"i received the wrong order and told them not to bother - and accepted it. unfortunately, my partner received his meal 15 minutes later - burned. he sent it back to the kitchen. so instead of having lunch together, we ate in tur "
the place looks nice and clean. we were asked to order some drinks and when our drinks arrived we ordered our foo 
"nice place for lunch or dinner with family and friends. rather good choice of menu and drinken, game room for children. friendly personnel and fast service (however it was rather busy on saturday evening)."
"just outside of batavia stad is this restaurant with a terrace shielded of from the wind, great! food is ok, but not really special. the menu lacks imagination. service is ok, but waitresses prefer to talk with each other instead of looking at the customers"
"the place looks nice but dirty, there were spiderweb everywhere. the service is very bad, we waited long time for our drinks and ofcourse for the dishes too. after we waited around one hour for a lasagna and a caeser salad, we asked the waiter if he can prepare the food for take away. we received a very burned lasagna and a so called caeser salad wich was not caeser at all. we recommend to avoid the place!"
"the food here is fine, and not long waiting time. it is located outside of the mall, so it is fairly relaxed and quiet, which is nice."
"it is a nice place to sit and rest your legs while shopping. service was fast when we ordered lunch and drink. food was good. however, staffs could pay more attention to customers because we tried to order more drink and nobody really looked at us."
"terrible place, ive ordered a sirloin steak without butter. the first time they brought this dish to my friend, although he asked for a ribeye steak and the waiter told him explicitly that this is his dish. after the waiter understood he made a mistake, he ordered a new sirloin dish and brought it with butter although it was explicitly requested without. to summarize do not get near this place. horrible food with bad service from unprofessional team."
"had a coffee here as a cycle trip stop. service ok, drink fine, nothing special, nothing wrong here."
"liked watching people and the town hall from the terrace, price/quality was just ok, nothing special"
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
now this is a really relaxed place very casual they have excellent food and every week they have a changing menu. always friendly people and in the summertime you can even sit outside. not too many tables so during rush hours it might be handy to make a reservation.
"i found this restaurant to be of a reasonable standard. the staff were friendly and efficient and the food provided was of a good standard. i had lamb which i thought was a little over cooked, however , to be fair there were 28 of us eating having not booked. i would recommend a visit ."
"one of the few places open for breakfast (most places donât open till noon). no eggs here, but good coffee, tea, hot chocolate. we had granola with yoghurt and fruit, and some pancakes. good!"
"warning! the restaurant building was interesting, but at the food was delivered haphazardly and without labels, leaving us to figure out what it was. at the end of the average dining experience we were told, much to our surprise, that they do not accept credit card payments. there was no sign at the entrance warning customers of this unusual limitation. so we offered payment by cash card (eftpos) which is a card pre-loaded with cash, so it is the same the same as cash. but they did not accept payment by cash card either. they suggested that one of us could go down the street to an atm cash machine and withdraw the cash to pay for the dinner! we were astounded that such a third-world way of doing business existed in what is supposedly a first-world country. this is not the way that the rest of the western world does business! their uncompromising cash-only attitude ruined the whole dining experience for us, so we had to ask our party of six people if they had enough cash among us to pay in this archaic manner. very embarrassing and annoying. my recommendation: do not go to this restaurant!"
please donât go here. itâs not even close to tapas. everything badly seasoned and served like they put it in a microwave. literally everything i ate was nasty....
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that âitâs an old hotelâ âyou can leave if you wishâ. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: âso my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink 
"this is a stunningly designed restaurant in an old post office. i was dining alone and sitting at a long sharing table. the menu is deceptively big but different dishes for different times of the day, so the choice per meal is small and all tast "
the choices in the menu were very small. if you donât eat meat or fish youâre not able to eat here. fries didnât taste well. and the didnât had the beer on the menu. bad experience.
grand cafe post plaza  in leeuwarden is a nice place to eat and drink. .........clean and cozy.... the price is good and staff are nice and quick service
"after waiting for ten minutes on a dirty table, that was not cleaned yet, we did ask the girl if we could order, she took the tip from the previous people and walked away with our order, but left the table full with the dirty cup "
the place is cozy and very enjoyable with the cat 
"this by far the dirtiest kfc i have ever been to. it looks as if the floors, toilets, drink station have not been cleaned in hours. all the tables we tried to sit at were sticky."
this is the second kfc i visited in this town because i simply couldnât believe the outcome of the first o 
the male manager was so rude. telling us to leave as soon as we had finished our coffee and threatening us if we didnât. not a relaxed coffee and over priced. do not go!!! ð 
"after being told they couldnât cater for a group of 10, 4 of us sat down for coffee and cake. the waiter was extremely rude on several occasions giving us time limits we had to eat and order more food by. he said if we didnât order more food and drink within 5 minutes he would kick us out (we were the only customers here and had been sat down not even 30 minutes). he spoke to use disgustingly and sarcastically and i wouldnât come back here even if i was paid. he then proceeded to wave his hand and point aggressively into all our faces trying to move us out our seats of which he scared us so we had to leave. over priced arrogant managers - take your money elsewhere as itâs a lovely little town but this guy shouldnât be in public service."
"we stopped at this restaurant for a coffee in the sun. after 30 minutes we were told we needed to order more food or we had to leave. the manager was so rude, intruded our personal space and waited until we left. do not visit this restaurant, itâs overpriced and the customer service is disgusting."
we went to this restaurant during a one day excursion to leeuward 
"this looked a very good bet - well located just to the side of the city centre on an attractive square and with an attractive interior, this was a disappointment. the service was very slow and inattentive...and one point 2 of the service team were sat at the bar whillst we were waiting to have our plates cleared and the whole dinner process became a chore, including even paying the bill which took just so long. the food itself was ok....not outstanding and certainly not good value (expensive for what we received) and the menu and drinks menu was surprisingly restricted. staff were very friendly, i must say, but just the whole system was slow, slow, slow."
"i came across a good deal for this restaurant, which was why we ended up here in the first place because iâd never heard of i "
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but donât order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. âiâll tell the chefâ was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
"bad place, the menu is different from the one in the photo. a waitress spilled sauce on my girlfriend, dirtying her jacket, shirt and trousers. they never apologized or gave any discount, they didnt even ask if they could help. also the meat wasnt good, it tasted like supermarket meat. "
"we booked a table for 5 persons but it was not ready when we arrived. this was a bit disappointing. it is a big place and the staff walks around with headsets which makes it a bit plastic and not personal to my opinion. the steaks were delicious, no doubt. but not a place to go for a romantic quiet dinner, more casual with friends."
"at first glance, a pretty and decent institution. beautiful glass sails create a cozy place. but do not rush! appearance is deceiving and this is the case. the second time i visited this avidion, i was convinced that i would definitely never come back and spend my 1.2 or 100 euros. why??? because, disagreeable service. lack of service. sleepy staff roam the hall, who are too lazy to smile, say hello. by their general appearance and manner of communication, you might think that you came to but to their home and they, giving you a huge favor, gave you tea / coffee / dish. further, on my first visit, the lady waiter 40+ presented me with a bill of vegetarian salad and two beers at 25 euros. at first i paid her in cash, even left a tip for a couple of euros. but after that, i looked in the menu to find out the price of beer. and it turned out that my bill was 20 euros. after discussing this, she returned 5 euros. without saying even sorry. today, i decided to look again at this âfarmerâs denâ hoping to catch a different atmosphere there. and what do you think? at the arena, the same ladies. with the same bias, not a welcoming look and complete antipathy. the only plus for today, did not have to wait a long time for the dish, as the institution was empty. but the bill, i had to wait, because the waiter (the same lady 40+) had a nice chat with the man and without paying any attention to me, demonstrating clearly ignore. she did not pay attention that i had already left the table, went to the cash register and was ready to quickly pay the bill. i was in a hurry, as it was time to run on the train. disgusting staff! disgusting service! complete antipathy to the institution, even in other cities. i will not go to this place even in other cities, and i will never recommend this loetje cafe to my friends / acquaintances / relatives."
 we had to wait ages for our meals and the waiter was not friendly. the food was great though and the ambience is super. but the waiters attitude brought the whole experience down. a sha 
"tasty but. starter was a tomato soup with meatballs. it was ok. after the starters er had to wait a long time before the served the main. i had the walrus burger, tasty but it was red inside. i am normally a guy who order the beef medium rare, but you cant serve a burger that way. that is terrible. for dessert there was ice cream and fruit, it was a generous portion."
de walrus has a nice vibe. outside is a basic seating area and the inside is huge and cozy. food is fine.
the most unusual aspect of this cafe is the way they present copious dishes of rhubarb with every meal despite it often not complementing the dish chos 
"food is okay. staff is very bad, they keep you waiting while they are not doing anything. and seem very grumpy at the table. i had this experience multiple times. by far the worst staff in town."
"the walrus is the big name in leeuwarden for eating and drinking. it occupies two and a half historical building and has a large terrace in front of it. the lunch special was a rather sizeable and tasty meatball for a good price, not bad. they could strengthen the menu a bit in low-carbohydrates and vegetarian options. service is friendly, though a little distracted, and not very fast. it was an irritant that the staff were quite busy rearranging the terrace during lunchtime (12:30) on a sunny saturday. removing gas heaters to be able to draw in the huge parasols, storing stuff right behind our back whilst we were working on the meatball. this could be done more pro-actively earlier i think."
we decided to have dinner here as the menu board at the entrance showed some dishes that would be compatible with certain intolerances we ha 
the service runs entirely via an apple ipod. so chances are that the service becomes impersonal. which is the case and the server blames it on the system! 
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere but when it come to the food we were a bit disappointed. the service was very slow and when we finally received our meals they were just average and therefore a little bit overpriced in my opinion.
since entering the city we had multiple attempts of people trying to get us to have dinner at the walrus. one even offering us free drinks if we di 
"went for the second time a couple of months, with similar experience "
"we visited this place on hemelvaartsdag for dinner and it was very busy. we ordered drinks and they came swiftly. also the food was quick to arrive. the staff is wonderful and very helpful. we had a walrus burger (medium rare), pork fillet sate and 2 salmon steaks. the burger was not medium rare as promised on the menu and the salmon steaks were full of little bones. ok, it is a steak and not a fillet, but still. the sate consisted of large chunks of meat, heavily marinated, but not dry. the sate sauce and atjar were very good. fries were great, salad and fruit compote nice. overall a nice place to have an uncomplicated dinner, but the food can be improved."
"dont get me wrong. this place is solid, but from when i started going there three years ago it lost some of its charm. definitely doesnt deserve the #1 rating it has. again, i still go there but there are other places in town that offer better food (unless youre really into bar food). the beer selection though is great as are the staff and the atmosphere is unique. definitely go, just beware that its not really a #1 pick. "
"very central bar/restaurant. staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is good. menu was very varied, with specials available. the quality was fine and the prices very competitive.  recommended for a quick, basic lunch."
"last night we decided to dinner in leeuwarden. i picked the no.1 restaurant in leeuwarden to celebrate our 2 years relationship. service of the waiters is nice they are really pay attention to the guests. this restaurant really busy in the weekend. i ordered vlees trio but sadly the meat its too cold and the fries also. so i told the waiter and they gave me extra meat and fries, but frankly its almost the same they are not really hot when arrive in to my table. because shortly lots of people coming to dinning the service bit slow, we have to wait 10 minutes for our last coke col "
i was here on a monday night on my own for business. as it was the only restaurant with people on the market near my hotel i choose to have my dinner here. i took a glass of red wine and the tame duck for a main course. quality of the food was oke and the amount was more than reasonable. for the rest nothing special to report.
"nice place and food, super slow service. they have some burgers which, personally i did not find attractive (too greasy, simple, heavy...lets just throw some stuff). i waited for a beer half an hour, literally. and also when we asked for a receipt they were slow. excuse was: it is busy "
very busy restaurant. waiters are nice and friendly. food was not very good. steak was weldone and the other raw.
"i went here with a partner for our first date (long distance relationship) we ordered a platter and it was good but after we paid and left we noticed that the waitress who had been cranky all evening and hadnt even cracked a smile or welcome us had not given us the right change and we wer 13 euros short (hadnt noticed at time as she was rushing us and we never recieved a typical bill she just came up with a bum bag of change and told us the price , no reciept nothing so we gave her the money and worked it out afterwards that we had been short changed and 13 euros is quite alot to lose when theire platters of food is about that mu "
"this bar/restaurant is excellent for drinks, tea and cake (i highly recommend the monchou taart) or lunch but not so much for dinner.  i think the quality of the dishes is okay but not good enough to justify the (high) price."
"the location in the historic centre is great, but the food is bog standard stuff, the staff is efficient but are just that, no attention to their customers, other than the obligatory everything ok?"
the service is great: the waitresses were all very helpful and friendly; they were fast and efficie 
friendly staff and ok food. nice atmosphere. lacking a bit in taste of the food- too nice in a way. would liked the tastes a bit more experimental.
i had the fish & chips which was not very expensive but certainly not a bargain either. for that price i would have expected cod but im pretty sure i got hake. staff is very friendly and there is a wide range of beers to choose from.
"the lunch menu contained beaf, chicken, pork, lamb etc  even after indicating i was vegan and explained what it meant i still got a salad with cheese....  restaurant is nice on the inside and has an old school feel to it."
its a nice place where eat something traditional. always was good and the price was not so expensive. good beers and kindness owner!
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of rÃ©cola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"the menu looks promising, the descriptions enticing, but unfortunately... the meatballs were re-heated in the microwave and some were boiling hot, others were cold and disintegrating. not an experience we would care to repeat."
"went there on a saturday afternoon because of mandatory closing time at 17.00.  food was ok, but service was difficult. gave us the wrong wine (white instead of a red). starters were better than than dinner. portions too big and overall not value for money."
the food was nothing special. the spare ribs were very dry. the environment was average. the stuff were friendly and polite.
"alright, this one isnt easy. let me start like this: we wanted to take the tapas all you can eat formula. after a while, we still didnt get any order lists or something alike, so we asked if we could order our food. seemed that the all you can eat part is eating what they give you. you do not have any choice in the matter at all...none of the waitresses gave us an information about the system when we got the menu, nor any descent explanation later from the boss. âwe make everything freshâ¦â donât they all?! the confusing part is this: nowhere on the menu or on the website they mention that the âall you can eatâ formula isnât free of choice. normally all you can eat is: all you can eat and you pick what you want to eat. i think it is reasonable to assume they work the same way. clearly notâ¦ so on to the next choice on the menu: the five tapas formula for 2 persons. here the same problem: you get the most sold tapas of the month, not the ones you want! soooo extremely frustrating. what if the most sold ones arenât the ones you want?! i mean, seriouslyâ¦at âla cubanitaâ you can order anything you want and as much as you like, now that is an: all you can eat formul "
i went there for dinner with coworkers and was totally grossed out. service is super slow. it took almost 10 minutes to get a menu. i only ordered a salad because i wasnt too hungry. when it came i took one bite and before i could take another i found a massive hairball in the salad. the manager offered me something else but of course i refused to eat anything else out of that kitchen. my coworkers said their food was ok but my experience ruined it. the bright side is the manager told me he didnt charge me for the salad...but he did charge me for the drink. ð would never recommend anybody eat there. 
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description. 
this restaurant was chosen by an opinion gave by the recepcionist from the hot 
"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didnât order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didnât show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."
"i was accompanying my partner for a dinner date he had the planed for. he called to arrange a window view for a romantic sunset dinner, but the staff werenât sure over the phone. when greeted at the restaurant, the seating was denie "

located near the railwaystation but quiet. has a nice terrace. not sure about the food quality. rather mixed opinions. good for a quiet drink on the terrace. the inner room is less cosy.
"this was one of the few places that didnt look too pretentious in the area. it was not too late in the afternoon but the place seemed very quiet. anyway, the waitress was very helpful and we had a good, basic, meal."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
amazing refurbishment!! really nicely don 
went in to ask if i could eat but had no reservation. asked if i could reserve a table and come back after a walk. was welcomed by 3 angry staff/owners. never again.
badly designed and poorly maintained recreation area.
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. itâs okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us â¬ 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly â¬ 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"as the title says. the sausage (rookworst) is awesome. the other food is good, nice and the shop is super-dutch. a must for foreign tourists"
the shop is not very special. quality of products is good but not exceptional. the interior of the store is a not very attractive
lower price range department store... no more and no less.
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
service was good but we were there with a huge group of women and we expected (as the sign said) different bites. the second course waa basically a big bowl of chicken wings. not spanish and 0 inspiration. sad thing. it used to be nice and fun to eat here. this was a shame. 
"i really can not understand why it took so long to get our food, it was a friday night but not at all busy, they got our orders wrong and it was not at all busy, which should have been a sign. the waiter was rude and unapologetic and basically had a crappy attitude. the food was tasteless and it was obvious that the cheapest of the cheap ingredients were used. please do not go to this waste of money. absolutely awful."
"well, what to say? i guess we all know what mcdonalds is, and if you dont, keep it that way. they serve what you call fast food. im not against fast food perse, but it should be nutritious, healthy and well cooked. it was not well cooked, im sorry to say. the burger i had was still on some spots raw and under cooked. toilets were dirty and the personnel were rude and impolite. when i asked for a moment to decide, the lady behind the counter walked away and served someone else. i really need only a second to read the menu. fast food and fast serving. oops. im really sorry, i hoped for a better experience, but unfortunately it was not. next time no mcdonalds."
"generally, i do not recommend american fast food while traveling abroad.  however, if you walk by, go in and get an order of fritz with fritz sauce."
"again i am surprised about all the 5* reviews for this restaurant based on the quality of the food we ate. we arrived without a reservation on a friday night and found a table for two. the vegetarian dim sum is fried and not steamed, which was a surprise but tasted quite good. spring rolls were as you would find anywhere. for the sate main the vegetarian choice was just ok (sauces not that good), but the fish was barely cooked let alone barbequed (see photo with review). i could have done better myself in 15 minutes at home, possibly the trainee chef was on this night. as they seem to specialise in sate i found this top be a poor show. maybe this is a place for meat-eaters as wouldnt recommend for nayone to try."

"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
"as a snackbar itâs quite commercially operated and loses the touch with its customers , could do with a lot more personal attention"
"went there with wife while waiting for daughter. very nice drinks, superb upstairs which is probably better to sit in than downstairs. good for people watching."
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
"my wife and i had lunch here, i ordered saltbeef and liver, my wife homemade beef burger. i ask the waitress what sort of liver it was, she asked the chef and he said it was cows liver. to my amazement i received processed liver sausage with big white pieces of fat through out. my wife beef burger appeared to be home made, but was cooked in advance. from the time we ordered our meal to receiving it would not have been long enough to cooked such a big burger, it was just reheated, but not hot enough to melt the cheese topping. i eat my lunch after all it was liver, my wife returned her burger, she was offered an alternative butt by now she had lost her appetite."
"me, the wife and our 6month old baby were looking for a place to eat and according to tripadvisor this was one of the best in sne "
"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if weâd reserve a table for 6:30pm, weâd have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again. "
"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."
a group of sailor friends we went to the place last night. the food was just ok but the staff were so uninterested in helping us sort the menu out. we waited a long time to be served and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. when we left there was no good b

it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"it is a descent restaurant. good dessert and appatizers. but i ordered the triple meat and got a little piece of steak, a sausage and a piece of chicken fillet. not from the grill. and for â¬ 20,- that not a good dish. cheap meat. for â¬3,- more you have a ste "
"the food and wine here is acceptable and its always busy, but if you offer cocktails on your menu - and charge 8 euros each for the priviledge - then you should at least serve cocktails. we ordered two tom collins. the small glasses were full of ice and half full. we hardly tasted anything. unfortunately horeca in the nl is generally over-priced and substandard. frankly i am more angry with myself that i kept quiet and paid the bill without complaining..."
"service was attentive, but food was just average. nothing special. we were only in sneek for one night and wanted something easy, but id recommend something other than this, just bland pub fare."
this restaurant is more of a bar hangout type of restaurant. serves pricey bar food and drin 
"a nice restaurant with a typical european cuisine. intimate atmosphere, and maybe even a little too dark. nice and helpful employees and big meals!"
always s crowded place. decent but not the best. soup for lunch was adequate but not more than that. a bread dish was a disappointment: expensive for the 2 super market lumps of bread. at least offer good bread if you offer it as a meal on its own. also what we got to put on it was below what we are used being offered in other places.
"the food was good,tasty but a bit overpriced 90 euros for 3.also the service was really slow..almost an hour to get main courses!!the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly"
"we came as a family with two teenagers and a young boy. not much of choice in the menu. the teenagers ate the hamburger that came without tomatoes. the little one ate chichen nuggets. my wife the goats cheese salad and i took the chichen wings. in total an average meal, nothing out of the ordinar "
"i suppose you find this kind of restaurant in every city in europe. though the setting and surrounding is very nice, it is the place for having dinner without having to think too much. menucard comes in 4 languages and plates offered are what you can find everywhere (burger, steak, scampis, etc)."
"nice decor, lovely food, service was not good. way understaffed although the staff were really nice and friendly. 14 or 15 euros for most pizzas or pastas, desserts fairly priced, some starters over priced."
"rude staff, and the boss was just soo rude and doenst give a crap about there costumers. never will come back there. dirty,pricey."
the food was a joke. i realy have never had food that bad. no pation to be found. thatâs all i can say realy.   we ate and left to never return.
terrible service and poor selection choice of food on the menu. the facility was not that great. the waiters were not efficient.
"turned-up for a bank holiday drink and snack. service very slow and unapologetic. some excuses about there only being one cook available. 13,5euro for chicken salad. basic lettuce out of a bag from the supermarket, over-cooked chicken pieces out of the fridge, squirted with some sweet chilli sauce. felt royally ripped-off"
"sat down for a special beer and snacks. nice belgium beers ! mixed deep fried snacks came with just some mustard; after i asked (inside), i managed to get some chili sauce as well.  managed to get some sun on their side terrace."
"the name grandcafe conjures up great expectations, but the menu was no different than any other high street cafe. basic sandwiches and coffe/cappuccino. we had a cup of coffee and my wife cappuccino and went in search of something special."
"at last one sunny day during our holiday in sneek so we decided to go for a drink. the first stop was this place. waiting on the terrasse and trying to get contact with one of the waitresses, or waitres. no chance! busy with doing other things than taking care their customers, so after ten minutes we left."
"we only had a snack here, nachos and chips - they were ample. the menu is only in dutch and the waitress couldnt help much. there is comfortable seating inside and out and the toilets are fine. pruces above average."
i have been there with my girlfriend in a warm day of may. we had an aperitif and the service was good as well as the drinks. good place
had an evening meal here which was ok but compared poorly with our previous meal at the de walrus. the service was good let down by food which while not bad was not memorable. to be fair this was a day when there was a festival in town and they had been clearly busy all day and they were getting ready to shutdown by the time we finished.
"on our daytrip to zwolle and sneek, we made a stopover for drinks at this place. the location is great and the sun was out only the service was slow, we had to find a waitress to order some drinks. thats why we decided to try another place for our dinne "
"only go to this place if you just need calories to keep warm. in that case, this place is sufficient. if you happen to look for a good meal that you can enjoy, you should look elsewhe "
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an âi told you we were busyâ. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
just a normal restaurant with decent food but nothing out of the ordinary. kind staff and the size of the portions are more than sufficient.
"if youre looking for nice solid food, you wont be disappointed here. things like schnitzel, burgers and steak are on the menu."
"this coffee shop is across the plaza from the centrall station and opens early. if you need to catch an early train, or arrive in apeldoorn early, you can find good coffee and breakfast treats at a very reasonable price. the atmosphere is friendly and the food is fresh! its only a few blocks away from the central shopping area."
worst customer service we ever experienced in a mcdonalds. 3-4 employees looking at you waiting to place an order at the mccafe. after several minutes of waiting i decided to place an order at the machine. it took 5 minutes until somebody appeared at the coffee machine despite no other tasks at this point of time for the employees. coffee cooking took another 10 minutes. after completion the two cups were placed on a cupboard to be picked up by another employee. additional 2-3 minutes waiting time while most employees were just doing nothing. of course the two cups had no marking indicating what the cappuccino and what the latte machiatto is. overall highly disappointing and badly organized. the management needs to start working on a lot of issues in this restaurant.
"had a mckroket; those are interesting. a pretty standard mcdonalds with free wifi and decent service, but they have the machines at the front so you dont have to interact with anyone if you dont want to, you asocial silly person. :)"
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had satÃ©. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "
"we were in 20 people, ordered different dishes, starters and desserts. i ordered risotto with forests mushrooms and.. it was really bad risotto with champignons.. and frozen asparagus. bad taste, too salty. forests mushrooms only from bullion cube. not worth that price. my boyfriend ordered duck, which was also not so tasty. too chewy and without duck tas "
"my husband and i visited in the opening month. we were quite disappointed and would much rather have a very tasty burger for half the price at finnegans pub in the center. food was edible though, but we wont be visiting aga "
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.

"what a waste. no way she was going to serve me a cup of tea âno way sir, not my jobâ and serving me a kroket that was rotten: âyes sorry, i already thought it was offâ. if i was the owner i would be ashamed. but apparently they completely lost it, donât care anymore and you as a customer should not care either. donât go. there is tons of places in the area that love to serve with a smile and deserve your money more then ever."
"we were there in february for a business / relach dinner ... nice place, cosy place, fresh food, nice drinks ... but can only be considered as exceptionnal, fabulous, fantastic,  "
"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "
"being the most busy terrace at the square, we choose for jules verne. a friendly guy guided us to our table, which he cleaned with a wiping cloth. during our dinner we learned that this wiping cloth doesnt get cleaned! he used it at every table time after time "
"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"not for fine dining, but if you are hungry and want some schnitzel, fries and beer in a comfortable setting in central apeldoorn, you will be happy you came here."
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"i believe several times i consumed a drink, a smoothy, or a coffee, or a hot chocolate, for it looks hip, that restaurant, or has organical products, american quality, but i dont get the things done, that need to be done, its all waste of time. and it costs money, all those things do, and i dont make any friends, anemies, yes. "
"it is a pity that the brick and mortar shops nearby are empty, for rent. the street with the outside tables is not lively. service is fine. food is good."
nice coffee and a relaxed entourage. we did only some drinks but the menu looks great and tasty. one small comment: there was no baby changing place.
"this place is nothing special: just a corner restaurant where you can get bagels (different varieties with different toppings), juices, coffees. bagels are good though, served warm. several kinds of cream cheeses to choose from too. all in all nice place for lunch if you dont want anything fancy."
arriving at 18.00 with a group of

"this mac is not very big allot of trash outside but this can be a moment moment. the food is normal like any other mac so enjoy. your close to the highway so you can go east, west, north and south."
got here with a voucher of vakantieveilingen. three course menu. as starter we had the fungi and carpacio both very tasty. we both enjoyed the main salmon course with fries and salat. we finished with ice and baklava. serving staff is a bit slow and the restaurant is a bit on the sober side. also the marktstraat is not the prettiest street of apeldoorn. good value for money though!
"nice place, not a huge selection on the menu but enough for a nice lunch. went there with my mother and they were willing to change her selection so she could eat it more easily as shes handicapped."
"nice pub, visit it often for drinks and sometimes to have a nice me "
told us to leave because we were having a good time cat was on the bar got upset when we stroked it dont go here owner is miserable
after a lovely day all around the apenheul monkey enclosure. we decided to eat lunch. we both ordered a beef burger. i cut mine in half to see red raw meat and it was stone cold. sent it back to kitchen and it came back to me again raw. donât waste your money here. far to expensive.
"actually, this is a nice place in a nice setting on the edge of a park, overlooking a lake. more of a nice lunch venue than a dinner setting, with a pleasant terrace if the weather is fi "
"nice place for coffee or lunch, but not for dinner. great location, nice vuews, good service if not too busy."
visited after a day of apenheul. tries to be haute cuisine and comes very close. could be bigger portions for these prices.
we called to book and were told that we could reach without any problem: once we arrived the lady told us that she had received no call and that there was no availability. quite shocking to receive such rudeness after having travelled to reach the place.

"on a visit to apenheul (monkey park) we discovered this restaurant as we walked from the parking location to the entrance of the park. as it was just after the noon hour, we decided to stop here and have some lunch before entering apenhe "
"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"
"driving along the road into town a big sign in front of the restaurant xl steak â¬17.95. sounds fine. checked on the menu at the entrance: again xl steak â¬17.95. we ordered 2 of those. nice big steaks, modest portion french fries, tiny portion sauce. no garlic butter as promised on the menu. as desert caramel coupe, described as vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and pieces of chopped caramel. the ice cream was very soft and the caramel sauce missi "
"very average food, in an average hotel. staff friendly, but poor quality food for a four star hotel. dinner and breakfast both over-priced for quantity and quality. go just up the road to restaurant de heerlijckheyt het loo, and youll get a much better meal."
"the two other top rated restaurants in apeldoorn were fully booked so we fell back on the navet, rated #3. while the food was generally good, each dish of the 3-course menu was over-complicated. no wonder it took ages for the cooks to prepare them. also, the alsatian pinot gris flavour was off as it had obviously been kept for too long (375ml bottles do not keep well). the last straw was when we were charged a supplement of 17 eur for two small pieces of veal sweetbread which had been offered without information about the cost. its a shame how these small details can ruin an otherwise positive experience."
"it was a take-away hot chocolate, i didnt consume on the terrace, which looked nice enough, because i also feel the need to smoke a sigarette, when i consume such a drink, but i think the wheather was to bad, to much wind, so i consumed it somewhere else."
nice please to hang a round to haven an easy meal with a couple of drink.the haven open towards 6 oâclock in the event (18:00)
we sat down for a quick lunch at this place. the tomato soup took for ever to arrive.   i had one beer and was never asked if i would like another. waving didnât help either!
"very slow & we had a very unprofessional waiter. even with a half empty restaurant. thankfully, food was tasty when it arrived. will not be going back"
"location very nice got outside table, with perfect view of square.  omelet cold and greasy. not able to cafe latte eith lowfat milk. service friendly - but had to wait for service - even very few guests."
"we went here late one afternoon and quickly found a seat. we had planned on just having a drink but as we stayed longer decided to be lazy and have food as well. we had the house red wine to drink, which was nice and at â¬11 per small carafe good value. for food we had vlammetjes to share, i settled on the satay java and my mum on the vissersverdriet. my satay was bone-dry, there was one piece of kroepoek (prawn cracker) and the rest of the plate was just filled with chunky chips. my moms vissersverdriet was smoked salmon on toast, nothing more then that. she even stated that the cucumber seemed to be missing. not worth the price. well stick to drinks the next time we visit. although the vlammetjes were lovely."
"we were in apeldoorn for an antique market, and it was time to eat something. we had a choice of restaurants to go to, and we chose this one because its menu included uitsmijters...a favorite of mi "
"stopped here on a sunny weekday afternoon to have a drink on the terrace in the summer sun. the ambiance was really nice on the square next to the old town hall, with its carillon bells going of regularly. the service was prompt, friendly and appropriate with a good attitude towards me, my wife and my toddl "
"so we cycled to apeldoorn and sat a grand cafÃ©, at the moment we came in some people where just about to leave their table at the window. perfect we thought so we can keep an eye on our bikes. their cups and glasses where still on the table but we did not bother, because we expected they would be taken away immediately by the waiter. after a few minutes (5 or so) a waiter comes and we order two cappuccino and both a piece of apple cake. after 7 minutes or so we finally get our cappuccinos in glasses which where not washed very well. (meanwhile the other glasses are still on the table) the waiter goes away, and we assume he is going to get the apple cake. but no, he starts hanging out with the other waiters. after 5 minutes we finally get our apple cake. that took long, but they had most likely put it in the oven to warm up a bit. noooo the ice crystals almost on there that cold it was. we where lucky an other waiter spotted the other glasses and finally took them away. for >10 euros we expect a bit more, it does not have to be perfect but a clean cup would have been nice. and in winter you do not serve cold apple pie."
"needed to go into apeldoorn center to buy some gifts.   was a bit hungry and tried de notaris.   simple dishes, but okay.   maybe more suitable for a drink."
"service was poor, too few staff for a busy evening. food wasnt bad, but have waited for it a bit too long. as you get your printed bill after you pay i didnt notice they put one extra drink i didnt have on it. not good, will not go there again, definitely not recommended."
we were there with seven friends and had a fine dinner and a good time! the place is small but nice. normal prices.
"waited 45 minutes for appetisers to arrive. after 1 hour and 40 minutes our main courses had still not arrived so we paid our bill and left. the place was busy but this was really unacceptable - it appeared that the kitchen could not keep up with the number of diners, who are packed into the restaurant with very little space. the appetisers we had reflected the menu, rather old-fashioned heavy french food, and the bread served at table was stodgy white supermarket style baguette. disappointing!"
was there for the first time and invited by a friend. the regular cook seems to be ill for a long time and the kitchen is managed by juniors it seems not knowing how to fry ossenhaaspuntjes. the aspergus soup was fine and the cheese as desert ni 
price-quality fair. due to misunderstanding (....) we have waited more than an hour for starters. nice ambiance. recommended.
i ate here. it looked cute and it was very busy. 
i had a business dinner in this restaurant. outside was terribly cold with snowy. but i liked athmosfer in this place with kind waiters..
"the food at parthenon was far too salty, not big on seasonings, and over-priced for what you got. the atmosphere is nice and the staff competent, but the food left a lot to be desired. if you want good greek food in the netherlands, make the effort to go to akropolis restaurant in alphen aan den rijn."
"as lovers and consumers of greek food on a regular basis, i could say that although the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was good and friendly, the food was mediocre. no real greek taste to anything, nothing traditional, just very plain tasting dishes. also quite pricey for a greek restaurant! the tzatziki had no bite to it, there was no pita or oven bread available, desert was dull and tasteless and the meat and sea food had nothing greek about them. disappointed - will not return!"
"the waiter probably doesnt know how to cut cheesecake, there wasnt part of it and half of pinta of beer costed 4.5 â¬ which wasnt in menu (winter beer)"
"we ate with colleagues as a christmaslunch. for my colleagues the portions were to big so they ordered sides as a main, and all was good, no problem. it took a while and when the meals came, some of them were not really hot anymore, but thats why i reviewed it as average and not good. iff the meals come warmer then they would get four stars ;-)"
"based on our experience just a month ago we decided to go for some decent pub food once more, but were disappointed. the lambsstew was this time watery, the steak too salty, and the waitress by no means as friendly as last time. was it our lucky day a month ago - or was this time the exception?"
"atmosphere is good, what youd expect of an irish pub. staff was ok, but not very fast.  food was very average. wouldnt recommend eating here."
"lovely terrace, descent food, chaotic service. i.e. go for lunch or a drink when the weathers fine - but expect slow service."
"nice place in the center of town. former school of music. on sunny days one of the favorits with locals, because of the big terrace with loung style seats. good spot, but for a beer or so, not for food; menu consists mosly of overpriced snacks and bites. staff sometimes seems more interested in eachother than in their guests"
"after a business meeting i went to this restaurant france atmosphere. the weather was good so choose to sit outside. food, they only serve 3 course menus started with escargo, it was salty like the north sea! too oily garlic butt "

before a movie i took my family to this place for lunch. the little man had a burger. he asked for a well done burger and the waitress said it might be a bit dry. so he agreed to a little bit of pink insid 
"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."
"the concept of this location is based on offering a nice space to work, together with good drinks, and offering some meals as wel "
"simple good food, no more no less,  sufficient choice and good to get you going for a long walk and/or ride by bike"
we waited one hour to place our order. then we simply gave up and decided to stick around in the sun (still no one helping us). we talked to four different people in the staff who kept saying âsomeone will come in a minuteâ or âplease wait a few minutesâ. some staff completely ignored us when we asked for help. terrible. unfortunately not many options considering this is a national park.
we have been passing by to have a beer after our bike ride and even after 40 minutes we did not get a waiter to take an order. we went inside and they told us to wait outside at the table and also contacted 4 staff outside. nothing. very bad service.
"from the outside the place looks ok, but when you enter it doesnt feel like a restaurant at all. more like a cafeteria in a retirement home. very old and ugly and not a good atmosphere. the price of the food and drinks is too high for the quality. such a shame because its a great locatio "
"let me first say that the food we ordered was amazing. this was a 10/10. the amount of food and the presentation were beyond our expectations. but as we were sitting next to the bar/kitchen, we were able to see our food being prepared and hear the employees talki "
"it was a great evening with colleagues. we ate at âhet zusjeâ. the food was nice, some food was âreally goodâ and other were ânot my typeâ. you order 2 small dishes at the time, when youâre done you can order 2 new dishes. you can take all evening till 22:30 to order. the staff was friendly but they seem to forget us all the time. it was busy but not too bu "
i think all the ingredients i remember can or do grow nea 
this was part of a business outing. there was not a lot to do. plenty of lanes to use. we had three. the games are short. not really needed to play for a full hour if the number of people is limited. food choices are limited and basic but well prepared. seating is limited as well
"the staff are not the most attentive ot customer centre focused. upon arrival, i was ignored and not welcomed. i could on your staff twice but was promptly ignored until i raised my voice far above what is normal and socially expected. we were eventually led to our table. we were the first ones to arrive however the last ones to be served. customers came after us and were promptly given a drink, orders takenâ¦.i had to shout to one of the ladies serving everybody else, who seemed to be ignoring us. normally at a restaurant, staff members will come and ask you, is there anything i can get you, without the customer always having to attract attentionâ¦.anyways this was not the case. i am also very dissatisfied in the food. i had an octopus salad which literally was cumber, tomatoes and onion with canned octopus ðð¾ my 12 year old daughter could make a more creative octopus salad than that. the only thing that was nice was the view. the customer services was poor and the food was average. the only thing that happened quickly was the staff bringing me the bill to pay. the experience left me wondering if it was because i am black that i was treated soo poorly, as none of the other customer who were white had to shout for attention ð¤·ð½ââï¸"
"was ok, staff is very friendly but the portions were huge and the food was quite salty and all tasted the same. we had a family style dinner and it tasted unremarkable."
"we were with a group of 8 and they suggested a shared platter. the amount of food they brought was ridiculous, it was way to much! food was ok but bland. we were full after the first course and the second course was even more. in the end the bill came to over 500 euro for 8 people. way to much. "
in this restaurant you can have a good greek meal. lunch or dinner. it is a cosy restaurant for families and coupes.
"i have been there on the first night of my stay in arnhem. functional position, just few steps away from the station.  souvlaki just tasted normal. the place is a bit too tawdry for my taste.  average prices."
"visited with grandparents and teens. we all could chose and ate with pleasure. greek is about cheese, thats what i remember most. and there s a limit for me. but that is my taste."
3 of us booked a table 6.00 we ordered 2 pizzas and a starter it was a mess we orderd a wine each. while we were waiting...and waiting and waiting!!! our bill was 70 euros mostly for the wine.. we were shocked.. girls were very nice but kitchen was chaos.. it took 2 hours before we got our dinner..also no anchovis..no green olives... never again!!!
"waiting for 1,5 hours and still the pizza wasnt the "
we went here with a group of 8. we got a table all the way back at the restaurant. lets say it was not the most cosy place they could give u 
"for this occassion we ate from the special ah-spaarkaart menu. luckily this did not mean that there was hardly choice. still we could either chose from this menu or a pasta / pizza. well done! good taste. my oven roasted chicken was delicious, bit cheesy though. "
"pastas is ok. doesnt taste like pastas in italy. staff are kind and helpful, cousy and easy to find from central station. toilets are clean but old and a bit messy. prices are reasonable."
"what do you expect from the pizza chain? a decent pizza at a good price. pasta dishes also available, but i did not have that. the pizza is exactly what you would expect."
"it is cheap; too cheap to make an eatable pizza obviously. the bottom is prefab; tasteless. topping of tuna: dry and no taste. no herbs, nothing. to add some flavour. my wifes pizza was little better."
tried here once very noisy and very very cramped more a young crowd place food was food nothing to talk about we will not be back
visited november 2013. english is spoken and there are english menus availab 
"we went with 4 friends to eat some tapas at la puerta. it take a considerable time before you get something to eat or drink. once they served the dishes, most of these dishes seemed like these were not freshly prepared or the dishes were cold. the only that makes this restaurant interesting is the location, the basements of arnhem."
the food is good here and a nice price. but i would prefer la cubanita (not so far away from this restaurant) to eat tapas.
"great for sharing food. most of it was nice, but used to be better. i was really looking forward to the spareribs, unfortunately they were a bit dry. but other than that, it was a great night out."
the worst caesar salad ever! the sauce was definitely doubled with tap water. barely anything in the plate for 14 euros. what a joke.
stunning ambient lighting but closed early on the monday night that we visited. nice enough for a beer...
"the service is nice but not that smiley and the terrace is charming. but the lasagne was a little bit burned, the chicken wrap was missing some taste, tabasco was 1 year overdue and therefore only poor review."
my favorite part of le bon vivant was the atmosphere. the ambiance was very quirky and charming - full of amusing items to ponder. there was no english on the menu so we had to do our own interpretations however we were able to find something to order. the staff was not very attentive and the food was pretty good but we probably would not return.
"nice location for watching people and vibe on jansplaats. average sandwiches, good coffee, indifferent service."
"we would like to eat with the family there. our daughter has food allergy. the menu card has no information about what is in any dish. the first reaction was that it would be okay. inquiry revealed that what our daughter was allergic to was in a sauce. after consultation with the chef, who repeatedly looked at our daughter very annoyingly, the message was that there was no replacement sauce, whereas so far every restaurant in the netherlands had done that smoothly. drink drank and left quickly"
"we were looking forward to a nice dinner al fresco and as most restaurants were full, we gave the bon vivant a try. nice location and kind service, but truly horrible food! tasteless, endless use of the same ingredients, no correlation between what the menu said it would be and what actually materialized. heaps of chopped lettuce hiding cheap salmon, drenched in greasy sauces straight from the bottle....all in all disappointin "
"fantastic food for good value, located nicely for lunch on the terras in the sun, but sadly the waitress waiting us was terrible and extremely rude!"
nice but nice is very average food was ok but expensive for what we had. staff were very good but there are a lot of better cheaper places

"lots of restaurants in downtown arnhem. this french style restaurant offers a number of more or less standard french and mediterranean dishes. the ambiance is pleasant, they have a small terrace. the restaurant was pretty windy and the staff closed the windows when it was really necessary. french, just not too loud music adds to the french style. no haute quisine, but a good problemless place to come back to, as we actually did. the restroom is rather narrow, well, that can happen with very old houses!"
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."

we have been coming to this restaurant for many years on our annual visit to arnh 
"if you want a quick pizza or pasta you can have it here. do not expect the best of food. it is a cosy restaurant near to shops, cinema and theater."
"its a cheap pizzeria and you get your value for money. a fine place for a catch up with friends, without breaking the bank."
rubbish rubbish rubbish and more rubbish the food was tasteless cannot think of anything good to say about it
"i went here with my partner because it is a famous place for pizzas. i will never come back. the pizza didnÂ´t have any cheese and when we complain about it the service was really rude to us. the local is big but they put too many people and tables next to each other, you canÂ´t eat confortably. i will not recomend this place,"
ok this place is cheap and convenient but quality is quite low. our pizzas were rather tasteless and the dough is clearly neither homemade nor properly baked. and why would you add fat on the crust to make it shine? this is nowhere to be found in italy and only makes pizzas look greasier than they are. add slow service and you wont get the romantic dinner you were expecti 
we took time to relax in the shadow of st eusebius church with a few drinks from arnhems meisje. service was swift and the restaurant is in a good location not far from the hub of the old town. a standard but pleasant experience.
good place to have a drink in the sun. good food that is an ok price. good place to meet someone for lunch.
there are many more restaurants serving poor quality food for regular prices. but here they add abominable service and disrespect for free. what a bummer!
"well what can i tell you about my experience at this cafe bar. firstly i placed two hours parking on the meter a short (spitting distance) from the cafe, at the cost of approximately Â£5. (not their fault i grant you) we were sat to a table by a friendly waitress, who then walked off as though sitting to the table was all we had come to do. five minutes past and another friendly waitress attended our table and handed us menus and took our drinks order. two lattes please. these duly arrived at our table within an acceptable time, and we had time to browse through the menu. which really was like putting computer binary in front of me, as the whole thing was written in dutch. no translation. i did think im in holland why would they have the menu in english and fair enough i agree, but then a vast majority of the patrons sat around us were also english, all with furrowed brow trying to look like they understood what was written on the menus in hand. (its a point, is al "
after dinner drinks and coffee with the four of us. staff is full of pretence and annoyingly fake-jovi 
"nice place, very nice terrace, nice fingerfood, nice beer, but the wine is terrible. we tried the pinot grigio, the verdicchio and the sauvignon blanc and they all tasted like acid. this is the worst quality wine you buy in the supermarket and is a bloody shame that they sell this wine. so, if you go, drink a coke or a beer, but forget the wine!"
"in this small street there is this restaurant with two separate locations. we were in the garden, so nice! the staff is friendly and attentive."
"i normally love this place, great atmosphere and food. yesterday we went there with friends. the food was good but the service and staff where terrible! from the start we got the feeling of not being welcome. cold staff, candles where not replaced and they started cleaning around 2230 hrs (vacuum cleaner put in sight etc). i hope it was a one off... "
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
"the restaurant has a large terrace which is great during warm days. the card is rather limited which is a pity, just a bit more choice would have made it more pleasurable. very friendly personnel which is a big plus!"
"of all the places ive eaten so far in arnhem, this was one of the most unimaginative places....  too bad.. my grandmother opened this spot............. all 8 of us were looking at each other and shaking our head...."
"as a local i got here with a friend of mine for a beer after we had dinner somewhere else. this is has been an item for years in the city of arnhem, but i wonder for how much longe "
"i have been here with a friend for an informal dinner. it was goed, nothing extraordinary but for sure above the average of a dutch eet-cafÃ¨. the veggie burger was awesome! price/ quality was also ok. if you are in arnhem, dont forget to stop here."
"we started off with a mix of small dishes (gozo, sashimi, yakatori) and then i had the fish of the days (sea bass) and my wife had tuna. both fish dishes were ok, but were accompanied only by a small salad garnish and some fried potatoes. so it was a bit boring. but from my experience at eating in arnhem to date, none of the restaurants seem to have imaginative menus."
found this place on tripadvisor and gave it a try as we were in the area. i was totally disappointed. came into the restaurant and the waitress asked what we wanted. a table obviously? service was slow and the food wasnt good. very tiny restaurant/cafe. i dont know why this restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants in arnhem. decided not to go for the main course here and asked for the bill. the staff were eating and didnt want to get up to give us the bill. had to go up to their table to ask. ridiculous. never again. 
the restaurant looks nice but we were lucky not to get a table in the basement. be sure if you book a table. the waiters are more busy talking to their kitchen colleagues than paying attention to the guests. when arriving at 17:15 (we did not book a table)there was a slight panic like they were expecting 100 people. at the time we left 2 hours later the place was not full yet. the food took very long. starter and main course in almost 2 hours.... dishes are average. we had to ask twice for the chefs dishes mentioned on the menu.
"having read the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, we were expecting great things from graave â we were disappoint "
having read good reports about this place we were very dissapoint 
"very nice meal, but terribly slow. 90 minutes to be served an appetizer and hamburger. waiter charming and most helpful in choices."
my wife and i ate here while we were visiting arnhem over the weekend for our trip to national park de hoge veluwe. id specifically picked this restaurant for its rating on tripadviso 
liekd the atmosphere and style. disliekd that i wasnt served within reasonable time. actually just drank and left although i wanted to have dinner.
"so they advertise with all you can eat. so from the outside it looks quite inviting. so youre hungry. walk on. because as soon as youve decided to sit down and order anything, the waiting game starts. it takes them around 30 mins to serve you another helping of the all you can eat skewers. and they are badly cooked... i mean badly. no seasoning, burnt on the outside, tiny little quantities of meat hidden between big chomps of union. after more than two hours and forking out eur 40 per person we left hungry and frustrated. never again."
"probably the worst meal i have had in arnhem. i order the prawns to start, and received a very small shrimp in sauce dish for 9.95 euro. at bill time i was asked how the meal was, i explained the starters was disappointing, the response was its shrimps, you should have looked at the menu better. the menu states in de oven gebakken garnalen met een groente roomsaus which to me translates to prawns. and at 9.95 euros prawns is what are to be expected. never to return. "
"came here with my husband and dad, but this time the standard dropped. the food is dull and all we liked was the bread with sauce. disappointed with the results. will think twice to come back. this was our favourite turkish restaurant as i have been there for many years. "
"we went there on a saturday night, not too busy and a very good service. the restaurant looks beautiful with its classic atmosphere, the food on the other hand is good but not amazing, i didnt enjoy too much the pasta crepes (if i had read the menu with more attention i wouldnt have taken the risk) while the picassos chicken had a perfect sauce with an amazing flavor, but the chicken itself was not cooked good enough. my girlfriends dishes were looking better to be hones "
have used this bistro many times in the past when coming to arnhem for the para reunion...but tonight the food was awful...the service was really bad..i have always recommended this place to others...but not no more and i will not be returning in the future.
"if you want something that tastes worse than the cafeteria around the corner and pay about the same.. go here. dry (to long baked) meat, burned and/or overcooked sides.. for simple dishes i can cook at home i expected more. got a glass of wine thrown over me and an apology would not have been misplaced. ive been here a second time to not misjudge the first visit, what a waste of time and money... there are far better restaurants in arnhem that are actually worth visiting, skip this one if you want a descent night out!"
we sat outside with a few drinks and the local men were really rude and sexist to women walking past. not nice. it maybe old cafe but could do without the misogyny and comments.
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"almost at the center of the beautiful presikhaaf park you find this small restaurant. you can have lunch here outside in the sun or inside if thats what you prefer. the prices are low because some off the staff have an working disability, this sometimes can cause funny situations so know where your going! i find it a very nice place, hope you enjoy it to as well as the park and the small farm for children."
"it was good. the food choice is not extremely various but is very different from any other standard dutch bistrot. mostly vegetarian and unusual dishes (which i liked), the service was just a little slow and some improvement here would be appreciated."
"very good and friendly service, good location. restaurant offers a nice atmosphere, however the burgers are not that goo "
there is no options for people with allergies in their main menus and so we werent able to eat the burger. staff didnt seem faced with it either.  beware of that before you plan your visit
"the place is nice, good ambience but i didnt like the burgers that much. meat was too cooked and expensive for nothing especial."
"range of burgers, certainly no high cuisine. for a burger place not cheap, but much better then burgerking and mcdonalds."
"i have visited iveau burgers and wijn and ordered a gamba burger, which is the most expensive one, because i love prawns and i wanted to have a very nice lunch for my birthday, the price is â¬16,75 that made sure it was going to be a really tasty and delicious burger, i already had other burgers for less price in other places, so i had big expectations!! "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"i got here with a friend. he had been here before and suggested to only take a main course because the portions are quit big. he didnt lie! we had the meat platter for 2 and it was a little struggle but i finished it, or we both did;). so on the house you gt some fresh bread with garlic sauce, delicious! service is okay and the tasted of the food is go "
"if youre looking for a lot of food for little money, definitely go here! i looooved the bread, still warm mjum. after that it was ok. everybody has always told me how great the food is, so i will go back someday to try it again. the goat cheese salad had too much of everything and was way to big as a starter, but it did look pretty. i didnt even finish the pizza (which is a first for me), cause i was full after the bread and salad and the pizza wasnt great. the bottom was very thin but unfortunately not crispy. the mixed grill contained 5pieces of meat, most of which were nicely cooked, but because its so much, the last pieces are already below temperature when you start eating those. staff wasnt great either. we only had one drink cause nobody was near us. after they cleared the table when we finished, nobody asked us if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea. until we grabbed our coats and asked for the bill (we had waited at least 20min). i guess they had an off-day. so am hoping for better luck next time :)!"
in the past i really enjoyed this place but our last visite was an awfull experience. greazy pizzas and bad service.
friendly staff however the food was only so so. a bit burned. and the meat felt it was rushed. i was disappointed maybe it is better now since some time has passed.
"the owner refused to let us in. when she saw the two baby pushchairs, it was completely impossible to have lunch. although the restaurant was almost empty. unbelievable..."
"what an old biddy that runs this place. rude beyond description. walked in with my husband and was glared at by some old woman behind the bar. we went in for a coffee. eventually she came over, my husband orders coffee, but i wanted an americano as the coffee is too strong for me. my husband goes up to the counter to change the order and the old bat got flustered beyond belief saying she doesnt speak english. fine...my husband tried to explain in dutch. she wanted none of it. she brings a regular espresso type coffee and then he explains again that perhaps the glass they serve tea in along with some hot water would be possible? she had a dam fit! all the while saying she doesnt speak english and was visibly annoyed. i did end up with more hot water. we did need more milk and my husband went to ask for more. she said she already gave us some and was very annoyed. after we were done, my husband, whose roots are dutch with all relatives being dutch, went up to pay and said nicely in his broken dutch that he was trying to communicate with her in dutch and she was very rude. she said she did not care and he did not know how to act in a restaurant in holland and that dutch is the language of holland and we should know how to speak it. she said she ran the place for 54 years and it was her place and we should learn how to act properly in a restaurant in the netherlands. never have we come across someone so rude. ok that she obviously doesnt like foreigners, but why have a restaurant. time for her to retire. we have never met such a rude individual and our dutch relatives and friends are not even close to this way of thinking. will never ever go back and we hope people will refrain from giving her business. avoid at all costs. she was also visibly rude to other guests that were there."
very bad experience provided by the old lady serving. felt uncomfortable and unwelcome by her. she should retire!
"we wanted to eat at a local place and decided to eat here because the menu at the door looked very enticing. unfortunately the reception was icy and the service was slow and uninterested. got the drinks wrong, meat was well done and not rare. were not offered more drinks or desserts. very disappointing."
we have been here for lunch on the 2nd of january. the staff was friendly and the food was o 
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay â¬ 50 each. would not really recommend it."
"service was ok and the establishment seemed to be run with teenaged staff. the food was ok but lacked seasoning, and the salad was very oily. my husband said the pizza was good."
"after reading the excellent reviews on tripadvisor we decided to try this place out. the place looks nice: clean, a sunny terrace surrounded by greenery, kind staff, and very family- and dog friend "
"when you mix perfection with imperfection, the results are imperfect. thats unfortunately my experience with this little plac "
"great food (try their amazing bitterballen) and beer. unfortunately, there wasnt an english menu and not all the waiters were able to translate some things to us. our orders got lost twice, so it took more time than expected to get our food."
"the ambience is amazing, the club sandwich fish was equally amazing. i like that i was able to choose between soy and oat milk. in general all good...but the owner genuinely needs to scold her staff in private, it is beyond awkward to have to listen to when having a romantic lunch."
"this little patio has a great atmosphere. you can sit here to hide from the sun or rain. it is a cosy place. so for a dink, perfe "
"nice place, good coffee and but dry  cakes. we had good bread dish realy good comes with some adds.  location is good and nice place to have break. they have a game that not accept master card......  so its tricky....   skip this place"
"this used to be a really nice cafe. been there recently, it was busy with too little staff. since the food i wanted was only available after 3pm, i asked the waitress for other recommendation and she got upset. as you can guess, the atmosphere was ruined. food was average too, i dont think i will be back anytime soon. disappointed."
dont bother... it was quick yet not vwry tasteful.. skip this place. dont know how many words to use.
"situated at a crossing point of 5 shopping streets. approx 17 tables outside served by 1 person.  friendly guy. menu is variated. wine beer. several types of tea, salads and beverages."
"this small cafÃ© has an informal atmosphere. itâs at a nice location in the city centre, and thereâs outdoor seating as we "
"this is seriously the worst service mcdonalds of all time. slow, slow , slow...food almost always cold ....and rarely do they get the order right! its mindboggling that they get it wrong so often. this week i went there three times..and yep, they got the order wrong all three times..i guess its difficult to distinguish between coffee and tea. always 2- 3 managers  working at one time, but literally doing nothing. if you go through the drive thru, be prepared to wait forever..its quicker to fly to america then get your order here this way...and good luck getting what you actually ordered...this is the worst mcdonalds ever!"
"we visited the restaurant on a sunday evening. when we arrived at 17.30 it was still quiet but when we left at 20.30 it was packed. the interior is trendy and warm. i liked it a lot. cosy atmosphere, interesting men "
"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress Ã¼ber-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
they got my order wrong twice. no english menus. all they did to make it better was just a free cup of tea. the food itself was basic and subpar.
"my wife and i both had a burger here, they were very nice but they were on the small side, 2 burgers and 4 glasses of orange juice cost almost â¬30,00. after we left here we went to the nearest cake shop to top ourselves up."
"we ordered our food before we came and waited 1,5 hour for it. it took 45 minutes before they let us order our drinks and then the food came separately. very bad experience"
"we visited fika several times. if you want to have a good coffee in nijmegen , in my opinion this is a very good place to start. they have a very good coffee blend from a nijmegen roastery. along with the coffee we had a brownie - not recommended, it was like a piece of shoe sole... the personnel is okay, but nothing special. the place itself is not very nice, but is central. it tries to get a bit of a swedish style, but is just a place where the owners didnt want to invest money and this is why this location is missing the atmosphere... no background music, no colours for the walls, some basic metallic shelves (by basic, i really mean basic-like that the people putting in their garages or basements), white tiles on the wall like in a communist butcher shop. pity, this place could be something much more than that with a few more money spent for improvements - some pale neutral colours on the walls, some new industrial style shelves for the bar, some new design lamps, some music... "
"we got 3 of what they call smorrebrod on a menu with shrimp, ossenhaas and tuna. all three were very good sandwiches, but clearly the owner/cooks/waiters have no idea what a smorrebrod actually is. so food is good, but not as advertised. we had to wait more than 40 min for sandwiches. coffee was good"
"after shopping and ice skating we met at le duc for an afternoon snack. the place is clean and looks friendly comfortable. 3/5. the service is efficient and friendly. 4/5. we ordered green pea soup 3/5, bitterballen set 4/5, tok tok (chicken nuggets + fr. fries.) 3/5, white wine 4/5, green tea 3/5."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.

they forgot my order. my mate was long done with his pizza before my pasta arrived. the pasta itself was also terrible. not recommended
the best thing about this spot is that it has good atmosphere and is cosy and warm (in cold or rainy day). food was average compensated partly by friendly waiters. it seems to be popular place as it was very busy. it is about one street away from the marketpla 
"service was quite slow, pizzas average and had toppings not included on the menu(not great if you dislike capsicum) and charged 7 euro for some bread to start, which, given itâs an italian restaurant, i would have thought was free or at least way less than a pizza! disappointing experience, will be sure to explore another option next time. "
"after 4-5 minutes waiting at the door to get seated (as the sign says) and a few eye contacts met the waiters, we left. it was about 60-70% full on a saturday afternoon, not a super busy period. iâm willing to wait longer for a table, but i donât like to be ignored. doesnât really work well in the hospitality business..."
"well, i should be honest and fair. pizza is a kind of âroma styleâ, so dough is very thin everywhere, and this was the case. ingredients were not tasty at all, not easy to feel cheese or ham or salami taste. the problem was that, this combination had a bad digestive consequences, that means cheese was not ok and dough not well don "
visited this restaurant on a tuesday evening. the restaurant is situated very convenient at the center of the city. the interior is contemporary which fits the location it is i 
"dont really like to give negative reviews but in this case i had too :( went in with the idea of getting a good fast food pasta. went to a similar concept of a restaurant in groningen, and zappas did not come near the quality of the groningen one. the service was just not good. when we got to the table we did not get a menu. after a while i asked the neighbours one. there were no options in type of pasta, only penne. i ordered the napilotana, and when i got it it had huge chunks of badly cut onions... they were not included in the description. the pizza the bf ordered was pretty descend. overall it was not really a fun experience."
the service itâs terrible and the dishes cooked without any comprehension of italian cooking style. item a typical dutch appetizers such as cheese plate was served without any consideration of the cheeses and the quality of product used was extremely law. i think they just work thanks to their amazing location. 
"when we visited the place just opened, so it might be one of the reasons we did not like it. staff had no coordination between each other. we asked for drinks three different waiters and after half an hour we still did not have our beers. then, the waitress came to double check which drinks we ordered. not professional. pizza was very average. "
"if you are tired after shopping or spending the day in the city center and want to quickly have dinner, this is a good place to go to; pricing is questionable for the quality of food but isnt expensive."
"great style, good food (no average italian, but a bit out of the box menu), okay drinks menu but the service was poor. they forgot half of our order, we had to wait long to get served and when we wanted tonpy the guy didnt even look at us while talking, hard to understand... however, the price and quality were good so ill give it a second chance and hopefully the service be better then.

"really nice location in the middle of nijmegen but the standard of food is dissapointing. i ordered the hamburger, the patty tasted like it was bad quality store bought, the bun was dry and old,the tomatoes were old and some items off the menu werent available."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"the location is great, the beer pretty good, the food average to poor, but the service is terrible. ive been here a few times and either ive left because i didnt get any attention from the waiting staff, or ive stayed and had a series of forgotten orders, or unattentive waiters in general. such a shame on this nice of a location. "
i didnt manage to get the attention of any of the three servers so i left. waited for about 10 minutes
"usually, i have no complaints about this place. i really enjoy the beer tastings they do. the outside terrace is the most gorgeous one in the city. service is usually fast. however, we reserved this placed for our wedding reception for 25 people and it did not go so well... we booked the place more than a month upfront, spoke to a very nice and fast waiter who was supposed to be working at our wedding. on the wedding day, he was not there though, we got some guy who looked like he was working there for the first day. some guests never got their orders and after 20 minutes of waiting had to go inside to order again and bring the drink from the bar themselves. additionally, we ordered a big cheesecake for everybody (again, more than a month in advance). we were reassured every one of our guests will have cake. when we asked for it at the reception the waiter said that they dont have enough cake left and he knows nothing about the order. we waited for more than 1 hour 30 min until the cake was finally brought ( i guess they were baking it or buying it elsewhere). the cake was not decorated nicely, just served plain white on a white plate. usually, it is decorated. and to top it all off-the bill was wrong. they overcharged us!!! usually, a nice place with friendly and quick personnel. however, when they know they have to cater for a wedding-everything seems to go wrong. just awful. we felt ashamed in front of our guests for such poor service at our reception."
"the building is fantastic. de commanderie van st. jan is a medieval building in the center of nijmegen. there are different restaurants to choose in this building.(de hemel, plaats 1) and some other food related businesses. we had lunch in de hemel (the heaven). i chose the goats cheese salad. it was okay. nice cheese, some bacon and lettuce, with some dressing. there were a lot of tomatoes and cucumber without any dressing. the cucumber was dried out. as as said, the scenery is great, so next time ill try the other restaurant."
"i had dinner here and took the 8 course meal. i started with the bread and tapenade which was good. second round was the soup which was delicious. the next 5 dishes were fish and meat. with the fish, i could taste that it was fish from the freezer and not fresh, the meat was not cooked well. the waiters were very nice. i know that the price is not high (eur 28) but using more fresh ingredients would really improve the taste and quality of this restaurant."
"i went here for a lunch. the terrace outside is really beautiful. some of the waiters smile. this is the only good part of this place. we only ordered 2 drinks, a small lunch and one second drink. we were with 2 people. inside it was fully packed, the terrace was not even filled for one quarter. there were many waitresses. still they managed to forget the 2nd drink twice (we had to order one drink 3 times), forgot our lunch and when the sandwiches arrived (after re-order) the crockets were cold and the meat of the hamburger was cold. their excuse: it is very busy in the kitchen at the moment. so, do not go there when the weather is nice and the terrace is fully pack "
"me and my friends had dinner here and order the menu of 28,50 ( 8  course meal) which exists of meat sliced of a sword a little soup and salad, it took us 4 hours to from start to end a very very long time, the food was cooked, the pork rose and the fries very very salty - will definitely not go back here!! bad experience, been heer 8 years back (another owner then and then ik was great) - but in 2013 and up dont bother !! the beer however is super try it!"
"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
"especially in summer this restaurant is the place to be, visited by village people and tourists. you can enjoy sunshine until Â± 20:00 hr "
"large portions but not very good food. 12 ribs but dry. small, overcooked mussels in watery sauce. salad mainly iceberg lettuce. do yourself a favour and walk a minute further to it posthuswhich which does much better quality for similar price."
"this is located on a nice square in makkum.   the food is average, a typical dutch menu so little imagination.  its ok if you need somewhere to eat."
"for dinners with a eur 18-20 tag i would expect well good food. however overcooked steak (medium was requested), schnitzel was soggy of oil (not crisp) and plate was floating of the oil the potatoes was cooked in. however there are carrots and a salad as a side dish, so plenty of food. "
"food in makkum is pretty much the same, wherever you go...some places do some things better than others. this place has huge portions (normal around here) but they arent terrific. it is a good place to hang out, have drinks & people watch. the best staffmember is angelique, shes super friendly, fun, and genuinely cares about her customers. sime of the others could use an attitude adjustment! but you can usually find a table outside to sit in the sun, & the beer/wine is good."
"we stopped here one evening for a quick bite to eat. we found a table outside and were quickly served with our drinks - i had the enigmatically named wieckse witte wheat beer. the waitress who took our order was friendly enough but seemed to have her mind on other things. my order of plaice arrived without the special request for extra chips and it took some time to get any cutlery. the food was luke warm at best. my companion decided only to go for the tomato soup and hot chocolate with a pile of cream on top. that was ok, she said. with a bill close to 30 euro i wasnt really that impressed. next time we eat in makkum well try one of the other restaurants..."
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
"the food is not fantastic but reasonable priced. the people running are quitte blunt and seemed to be stressed, overworked. on a sunny day there is a serious line at a window where you have to order and pay. and although there is stated you can pay by bankcard (pin) and cash, i would strongly advice cash. the mobile network is for some reason in that place very very bad, sometimes your mobile gives no connection and their bankcard system is depending on it...so you would not be the first that walks away empty handed after a 15 min wait. is not helping the atmospher "
it is very nice to sit outside and watch the shoppers pass by at the plaza. food is not remarkable and often close to dutch snacks but it is a good place to be.
"i live in the area and pop into this restuarant from time to time. ive always found the food good, the wasabi mayonaise burger is pretty good and i found the lamb rack really really go "
bad food and no vegetarian dishes and when they were willing to amend a plate they had run out of pasta/rice. my salad with marinated beef wasnt tender at all. not going there a second time for dinner.
"this typical amsterdam snack shop sits exactly on the border of amsterdam and amstelveen. it has the usual selecton of inexpensive dutch snacks and nibbles, as well as warm and cold sandwhiches, including burgers and chicken sandwiches. there is a lovely patio if the afternoon sun is shining, otherwise it has small indoor seating, or a walk-up/carry-out counter. there is free parking on one side, pay parking on the other. plenty of space for bicycles. very close to then entrance of the amsterdamse bos (amsterdam forest)."
"small restaurant in the middle of amstelveen, right outside amsterdam. parking is a bit sketchy if you come by car. the restaurants interior is ok but nothing to write home about. we were there about 2 hours ago so everything is still fresh in my mind. because were a friday evening the restaurant was packed and extremely noisy. making a reservation is recommended. my wife and i had read good reviews so we went in with expectatio "
it was nice pizza and vibe but the manager was quite rude to the family beside us taking away the menus for the desert because they spent too much time make the pizza. the manager was verbally fighting back and not showing respect to the customers 
"kai the manager was already so rude on the phone that we were repelled straight away. even for dutch standards this is absolutely poor. asking me on the phone what time i want to join, me telling the time and then being told that actually theyre fully booked is not okay. why even bother to ask me then?! and then giving me a speech. not okay. either you have a table or not, but then please say so straight away and dont talk back to your guest and give an attitude."
"when we arrived the restaurant was full with families with kids. but we were offered a table at the window. they sell wine only by the glass of bottle, no caraf. the wine was great. they serve only pizza and no pasta. we ordered the diavola and four chees "
"i love surinamese food. this is simply not it. wrong flavours, bad ingredients, and not fresh. its the only surinamese place in the area, that is all it has going for it."
it only takes one bad experience with a cashier to make you never darken the door again. seriously after years of going i will find another cafe in the area.
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill 
"fantastic food and service generally friendly, but made several mistakes with the orders and as a result we had a very long wait for our meal without any recognition.  a shame as the food was excellent."
"food was ok, nothing outstanding, specially considering the pric "
june 5th we had a special celebration and our first choice restaurant was closed so we decided to go to de jonge dikkert as friends had recently recommended the fo 
"as i live close to this beautiful restaurant, ive been to this restaurant regularly. as i really liked the atmosphere and quality of the food, i booked this restaurant for a business meeting. what a disappointment it was. first of all, not all food was properly cooked, leaving me with a semi-raw langoustine. second of all, one of the waiters a) didnt at all know what he was serving and b) didnt have a clue about the accompanying wine and finally staff my dietary request was completely forgotten when serving the cheese platt "
i can only describe our experience as very disappointi 
"when we arrived we were greeted courteously, but then we were seated somewhere away in a corner, although we had reserved. so we asked to be moved as we like to soak up the atmosphere. the atmosphere was really good, relaxed and its easy to have a conversation. the tables are also nicely spread out so that you dont have the feeling that someone can listen into your conversati "
"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.
we went to this place for lunch and had okay-ish pancakes. location is perfect for a break while shopping in the mall.
had lunch here earlier this week with my best frie 
super slow service which is amazing for a shopping center restaurant.  more for snacks than a meal.  the rose beer was good.

this is a smart well decorated restaurant but the quantity of gnocchi with bolognaise sauce was insufficient for a starter and i ordered it as a main. suggest you choose the chinese next door and get some decent food.
our hotel recommended this one and it was full of tourists from other hotels that recommended it. the wait staff were disagreeable with each other and it carried over into their service. the food came out on time but we were stressed after our dinner from the cold atmosphere in the room. we ordered the main course ravioli to share as an appetizer and it was goodâone large piece of ravioli. we ordered the grilled fish sampler for main course. the sole was good as was the tuna and shrimp but the salmon was over cooked. we ate at some terrific restaurants and cafes during our three days here and this was one i would skip.
the coffee is okay however the big plus are restroom facilities which are in short supply in this center.  a good place to catch up with friends
place is packed with people and youd have to get your kids to eat their pancakes while standing. pancakes themselves are nice but not thrilling ( quite fattening ).
"the pancakes are great, well cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! the bacon cheese is very good and so is the spicy..they offer gluten-free pancake (if you order in the morni "
a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."
since years the quality of food is abominabl 
for first time since 2 years ordered the pancakes. my husband ordered qp me 
"a hotel that charges 120 eu for a one night stay for 2 persons in one of their single person rooms, which are expanded as double room, with an old matras, no airco and cloths as towels, should be fined. the breakfast consits out of old bread, too long cooked eggs and aqueous coffee and lacks a buffet. we couldnt leave this place faster, a shame for amstelveen."
access for tourists via public transport (ov or openbare vervoer) is difficult. but well worth the effort for the succulent and unlimited (onbeperkt) spareribs - a backpackers paradi 
"super great food, and big portions. but the staff was not very professional, we sat inside under the stairs and ashes of a cigarette fell from upstairs on our table. we told the staff and they did nothing to compensate, very bad. not planning to go back! "
very bad service. long wait for being served. we left after the main course after being 2 hours in the restaurant. very bad experience.
"the first thing we got told: no, you cannot sit at your prefered table because then i have to walk too much. that set the scene for the evening: every cause was delivered with some error, drinks missing for the apÃ©ritif, bread missing with the starter, fries missing with the main meal, the fries finally arrived after asking twice and when we all had finished the me "
"the place is really very average, the amuse we got tasted very much like supermarket spreadable sausage that was a bit dressed up. the starter of ossenworst ( spiced raw beef) tartaar conceptionally was interesting but the final result turned out to be a bit of the traditional ossenworst with some dressing on t "
"to begin with the most positive: beautiful location, nice quiet atmosphere. but thats it unfortunately. the concept is unclear: starters and main course are tiny (even for a starter!). so after two courses a healthy stomach is certainly not satisfied. the quality was not convincing. my tuna looked like chewing gum, the pork belly was nearly all fat. apart from that, the prices are really high compared to what is being offered. perhaps kronenburg is the restaurant for tourists who are willing to pay the price but as a citizen of amstelveen i must conclude that there are better and less expensive restaurants to go to."
"perhaps it was the fact that we were a very large group that caused the food to be a disappointment. the first impressions of the kronenburg are very favourable- a stylish exterior and a spacious, quality interior. the place has that air of quality about it. unfortunately the food was largely uninspiring. a decent carpaccio of scallops was a good start but the duck (tough) and hare (very tough) did nothing for the palate. an anonymous ice cream based pudding also lacked any substance or taste. i am sure the quality of food is better than we experienced but it may better when the groups are not so large."
"i reviewed this restaurant on 12 november 2015 and at that time was pleasantly surprised. however our recent visit was a disappointment, especially for the service rendered. the food was not bad, but also nothing to brag about. for a refill of our wine, we had to ask three or four times. the appetizer came in a reasonable time, but for the main course, i had to get up and inquire what happened to our order. when it finally came it was just above room temperature. we were not in the mood anymore for a desert."
food was good but unremarkable. the young waiter was perhaps just a bit too eager to please- pushed us for chips and wine when we had indicated that we were happy with our order choice. venue was quite smart with welcoming staff at the front desk. overall fine for a quick business lunch so would go again.
"had a great evening here with good friends one of them having a glut allergy. after a poor amuse (courgette kerry cake), a nice tuna tartar, a tasty lobster / steak, followed by a good looking desert. however, glut free coffee sweets were not available in spite of an upfront reservation. service friendly, fine ambiance with lots of space. overall a nice experience but could be better ..."
"the location is good.. a man made lake and green trees, with an outside terrace and a cozy minimalist modern interior design... but the food was the turn down.. ive been to hundreds of different restaurants in netherlands but this one is my absolute dissapointment.. taste is bland and plain, no beauty in the food presentation, size is unimpressive.. overall so dissapointing.. loetje should take over this restaurant and use the awesome location and building.."
"the location is the only thing that enjoyable while i dont know why there are many waitresses there serving food that wasnt even deserve to be called food.. tasteless, amount is like starter for a main course and dessert that looked like it can be bought in supermarket and no efforts of art put in it whatsoever "
"the good and quick behavior of the room staff cannot mask the low capability of the kitchen: the grilled mix is not grilled at all, the french fries are not french at all, the vegetarian dishes are not attractive..."
"menu and decor and staff all the same. pleasant waiters, easy wine, no advise with combi food and wine. food is simple and ok. close to hotel and around the area not much other choice"
"nice is quite nice. nice and friendly waitress and the food was nice.  nothing super special just quick, ok food at a very reasonable price."
i had watered-down onion soup with a cheese bread topping that you couldnt bite i 
"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "
place looks quite nice but limited menu. not very busy but still they managed to forget to bring veg with mail course. ruined the meal. i used to go before the rebranding and reopening but never again. owners need to check and train staff. our table were not the only ones having issues that evening...

ive been year for a dinner with some collegues during a business trip in amstelv 
"this restaurant is next to the grand hotel in amstelveen (less than a minute walk) and is basically the only place to eat when you dont want to go somewhere else by car or taxi. service and food are good, but nothing really outstanding. its perfect for a quick dinner after a long day of work. staff speaks fluentl english, so easy also for foreign guests."
"this bistro may be nice, but not more than that. it seems to cater mainly to visitors of the nearby hotel (no restaurant of its own) and of the sports complex as there is nothing else around. i gu "
"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
ive visited this place several times and yesterday was the worst out of a 
"after the starters we have to see the whole restaurant getting food but us. after informing at a waiter he said it would be there in a minute, after 10 minutes we informed at another waiter who actually went to the kitchen. we saw about 40 people getting served (also people who entered the place much later) before we finally got the main course. they were just in time, we were about to lea "
"nice place to be, i think its mostly after work drinks and diner. diner is good, but not surprising. its pub like / eetcafÃ©. waitresses are experienced and understand their job."
"after a walk we ended up here for a drink. ordered also vegetarian burger that was disappointed. it was not fresh prepared, they fried and not baked. the salad with it was tasteless and almost no dressing the french fries where to hard. in bother words very disappointing for 12 euro. the service was friendly "
you have never ever seen ribs this size and they are like something from the flint stones. good food and value for a family.  not gone fine dining. but worth a visit if youre very hungry!
this place has been the same ever since i first visited it in 2003. nothing really changed on the inside or the menu. still i am going back there several times a year just because it is what it is. famous for its sate and nothing more. it is really good thoug 
"this eatery is totally devoid of any sophistication. the entourage is chaotic rather than cosy, and the staff indifferent rather than inattenti "
"i dont recommend this restaurant for asiana family. we went there, and the waitresses treated us very rude. it was a kind of discrimination i feel. the treat local dutch people very nice, but not to asiana. i dont suggest asiana people to visit this restaurant."
"we visited this restaurant twice and both times the service was bad. very unfriendly and rude staff, but the food is really good."
"donât go to this restaurant after 9:00 because you will probably get rude treatment. my husband and i were craving good italian so we came here. we arrived quite late because we were traveling far, so we understood the inconvenience. when we came in, everyone stared at us like we were the worst for coming in that late. we asked the waitress if it was too late and said we didnât have to stay, but she said âweâre happy youâre hereâ and looked like she meant it so we thought, âgreat weâll have a nice dinner but eat quickly so they donât have to stay late for us. that was the last bit of friendliness we received. they sat us in the corner and took so long to bring menus or drinks. everyone else in the almost full restaurant was enjoying themselves and still eating when we sat down. the main waiter was refilling wine glasses, bringing people complimentary chocolates and laughing with other customers. obviously not in a hurry to leave. but he did not acknowledge us or welcome us. he just came by with a paper and looked at us to take our order. when he took it he left without a smile. we spent about $55 for the most uncomfortable, nice tasting italian food weâve ever had. all we wanted to do was leave. they made us feel so out of place. we ate and left before some of the others had even finished their wine and they were still cold to us as we left. we couldnât help but notice the waiter brought everyone a plate of chocolates with their check, but never brought us one. the food was fine but not worth it for our horrible experience. my husband ordered the pumpkin ravioli which doesnât have meat but was still 16 euros. it was very good, but i ordered a pasta with âbaconâ which ended up being thick pieces of pork that had a strange flavor. me least favorite meal of the whole trip. "
very popular restaurant  but the children enjoyed. not a brilliant location but near lots of housing.  service was good.
a friend wanted to eat itali 
"veri saporiÂ´s main attraction is passionate owner mario bianco. heÂ´s a fun host and our first visit a year ago was a great experience. sadly, it seems the rave reviews soon after opening this restaurant has lead to complacancy. our last visit this month was a major disappointment. our waiter seemed uninterested. his choice of wine was totally off and the dishes were ok, but otherwise uninspiring. we could have done better cooking ourselves and weÂ´re no master chefs. as the prices are quite hefty, we expect better from mario!"
if you can live with some traditional slow dutch service the food will compensate. fantastic pastas with the spaghetti vengole as the clear favorite in a nice ambiance with a lot of people despite the fact that we booked a table already at 1800. we will most likely be back but not at peak hours...
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
i recently visited grand cafe oude dorp and the fact it was completely empty on a thursday mid morning raised alarm bells. it did get gradually busier but that only amounted to about 4/5 tables being occupied. my friend and i were served by a surly waitress who seemed bothered by our presence despite being the only customers in the restaurant and when i found a hair in my salad (that needless to say did not belong to me) she merely told me sheâd bring me another plate. no apology was made and we were left well alone until we decided to get up to pay for our brunch. the food itself quite tasty and fairly generous in portion sizes but my friend and i both vowed never to go back there.
"right from the start the server just did not want to serve us. never smiled from entrance to leaving the restaurant. we questioned our bill at the end as we didnt believe we got an extra fries but there was 3 portions in two bowls, figure that one out... we would come back for the food but will stay well clear because of the service. life is to short and there are too many choices of good restaurants in the area."
"went there for a dinner, sat outdoor- nice view of oud dorp - and had an enjoyable meal. the menu offer a variety of dishes from snacks, vegan to international cuisine. i had spare ribs that were good. a good selection of wines an beers also availab "
"a place where you should pick anything fancy from the menu. the slibtong, sole was below average. the simple dishes were ok"
"the cafÃ© is located in the old part of amstelveen, close to the poel lake and city hall. its dÃ©cor is somewhat dark, which comes across as 70s style, however the seating is spacious and comfortable. no problem to have a quiet/confidential conversatio "
never ever going there again . i asked for a small portion of food (from kids menu) because i had recently a surgery and i cannot eat a lot . of course the âbossâ how waiter called him was really rude and couldnât accept this . in this way you canât keep the customers happy !! never ever come back here and iâm not recommend to no one . 
"poor quality for what you get, i was waiting 15minutes inside for someone to ask what i would like to drink or eat, they had like 6-7 people on the tables. my wife had a gastric sleeve surgery and she asked if she can get kids menu, the owner come and said you have to order from adults. waiters and owner very rude, avoid this place"
"club sandwich was not filled or spreaded at the edges, bread was soooo dry i hurt my mouth, 1 slice of bacon and one of the thinnest smoked chicken ham slice i ever saw."
"rude approach from unfriendly and unprofessional personnel. we arrived with about half an hour delay, apologizing because of that, and with 4 people instead of the planned 6 (and again, we gave our apologies). the tone of the waiter who welcomed us was aggressive and sarcastic, and he made us feeling quite uncomfortable, especially because it was a business lunch with our customer. the food was average, nothing special. i will definitely not recommend this place, there are better options in the area of schiphol oost."
"they were unable to provide individual bills although the reservation was made for more than 15 people. of course announced at checkout. no apologies and quite aggressive tone. obviously they dont care as the only choice in this area is the steigenberger hotels restaurant or them. its a pity as the food is quite good (even if we have been waiting one hour!). please change the way you are handling you guests, guys!"
"recently had lunch here with a business partner. in all fairness, the location is great and it has a lot of historic feeling to it, the restaurant is inside the former control tower of the old schiphol airport part, where it all started. however, the lunch was so so. the onion soups we ordered were a little watery and also the cheese did not have that nice thick and grilled layer that one expects of onion soups. both our sandwiches were average, we had a grilled brie sandwich and a grilled goat cheese sandwich. they were served with a lot of bread but not in balance with the amount of cheese. so, either provide more cheese or provide less bread. i would prefer the first, and would be prepared to even pay more for that. i also noticed that the brie was slightly overgrilled, so that could also improve. did not try other things, i think i will give it a second chance and try some other stuff, and see if they have improved. judging by the crowd, maybe it was just a bad experience from our side, as there were many guests in any case. service was nice and friendly, and that also made up for the average food experience."
new level of service in this restaurant. we made an order and ok sometimes mistakes can be made and some items might be wrong or forgotten. how likely is it that they will forget the full order? well they did. the waitress just didnt put it through. just like that. she didnt even come to apologise for forgetting. if you like sitting on your table forever like an idiot with no one bringing your food or coffee this is the place to com 
"first time in lpq in aâveen and never again. i normally go to groot gelderlandplein or in ams/ de pijp where service is outstanding and food is well prepared and proportions are generous.in aveen this experience is totally reversed. me and my friend ordered a caesar salad but to my great surprise it was not prepared with slices of real chicken but thin slices of cheap packaged cooked chicken slices and on some slices you could clearly see the veins. in addition the salad was full of big bacon cubes which had an overbearing taste in the salad.while we were eating our meal we were asked to change tables in order to allow a bigger group to take a seat! then there is the noise problem , since tables are very close to one another you do not have sufficient space and therefore lack privacy.nevertheless i maintained a calm demeanor in order to not spoil the mome "
"waitresses ignore the customers, even when you call them politely they act like a deaf and donât respo "
"it is such a pity this shop doesnât know the basics of customer experience. after a 5 minutes wait to be seated, nobody came. even if we saw 5 waiters, nobody dared saying hello. we then left to go to hema restaurant which was a nice experience (playground for kids, nice food and not expensive at all)."
will never visit again. appalling experience compared to other stores in the franchise. recommend to avoid.
"definitely worth a visit for a quick bite, everything fresh and very good quality. usually crowded, take away to be considered"
well placed outside the amstelveen mall area close to the monday and wednesday markets. the restaurant outside area is enclosed - inside can be noisy with the wooden floor and no soft furnishings.
"pain quotidien serves great breakfast: tartines, bread and fruit.  today our experience was sub-par: the staff was not attentive (maybe they had a great party last night) and the place was full of mosquitoes. so we quickly are our food and left."
"- ingredients were high quality, but less quantity - bad server - high price location for netherlande"
only stopped in for quick snacks during a shopping visit. clearly a place which treats young families well as the place was full of young children. the snacks were not very expensive but actually were not great value : 10 euro for an incredibly average open sandwich . one of those places you put down to experience and look for an alternative next time 
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
the service is absolutely appalling. iâve been sat here for an hour and only been asked what i want to drink.   if you want good / fast service then go else where. this isnât the first time.
"we were here on a sunday and none of us spoke any dutch (which we made very clear to the extremely rude waiter). we ordered two plates of the pasta gambas. we found out after eating (because i managed to google translate that the dish shouldve included mussels which it didnt), that this day apparently was the restaurants leftovers of the week-day - they served us the leftovers from that week and the waiter didnt tell us earlier. when i complained, he said, the leftover-day was announced on the first page of the menu. we made it very clear to him none of us spoke dutch from the beginning, but he never cared to enclose this information. however, i did check the menus first two pages on google translator again and did not find any information on the leftover-day. when i kept complaining he told me to stop giving him this attitude (actually quoting him here). we ended up paying 15â¬ for each of those pasta gamba leftover dishes no one told us about. i am not enclosing the waiters name here in public but if the restaurant is interested, i most definitely can. do not come here, especially when youre a tourist."
"moscow mule. 5 iced cubes in a super small glass, 1/4 of a ginger beer in it. â¬9,5 gone.  really bad."

"nice place to grab some sunshine, nice ambience, even seating inside, customer service is ok and food average. some options are good, others not so good (avoid the burger! unless you like junk food)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of childrenâs toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbqâed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
the frites were made as i watched however there was a separate charge for mayo or ketchup which is unusual.  the shrimp kroken was also locally made.  there was a bit of confusion that the pin wasnt available and cash was required.
"as its our last night here we wanted a special meal, we made a bad choice, as i have left in tears unable to eat my food and having been spoken too so rudely....the menu leads you to believe you get chips and salad with all main meals....as they brought out one portion between 4 of us i felt it was ok to go and ask where the others were to be informed that was it but we could order others and being told to let her finish when i politely pointed out that it doesnt say that on the menu.... i have left my husband there with the children as i was so disgusted....what a horrid way to end such a lovely holiday....added to this my husband just paid 109 euros for a meal that only 2 of the 4 ate......by the way other staff were lovely but the rudeness of one ruined it."
"after the kids playground we took the break for small lunch. it is nice place - view to the harbor. as outside it was hot, we decided to eat inside. it took some time to find from the something to everybody. menu did not impress. service was also not enthusiastic (but also not bad). next time rather for drinks then food."
service makes a restaurant experience and this experience was awful. awful!!! almost two hours of waiting for an incomplete order of burger and fries and waiters that just donât car 
"its good location, nice view. we went there for lunch. smoked salmon with bread was delicious. they also served iced cold beer :)"
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"de klink 2.0, it is much better than we visited last time when it was still just de klink. service was a bit slow, we went for lunch on sunday and there were two staffs. anyway, food was great. we really like chicken satÃ© and schnizel. "
we were there for snacks and drink. it was pretty busy as it was on sunday. tables on terraces were in a good location. the service was slow because there was only one staff who could take orders. the other staffs were not so helpful. we asked the differences of the menus but he could not answer and was not willing to find the answer for us. only he asked us to ask other staff. the location is good if you want to chill and if you are okay with slow service.
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."
"having visited this restaurant a dozen times since 1968 when visiting holland, our last experience for dinner was a big disappointment. people who came much later in the dining room were paying their bill while we were served our main cour "
"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. âno problem, sir. your round table is reservedâ, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: â we never book fixed tables sir, sorryâ. butâ¦.. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"
"ice cream and food are not special, and service it is just terrible. went for an ice-cream with my little one and husband and we wanted to stay longer to have a coffee and something to eat, so i requested a table but the waiter saw us with an ice-cream and told us no, and he pointed out outside saying that the sits for people who buy ice-cream are outside not inside the restaurant. we just wanted a table to have lunch! should not matter if we also bought ice-cream earlier.... anyway, not the first time i experience bad service there and not the first time i hear from friends about the bad service. for sure i am not going back anymore, they just lost a client.."
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
"proper âtwentsâ hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs itâs a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70âs feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still donât understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "
"perfect place voor eating in town at affordable prices after you have done your shopping. in summer outside on its terrace . meal quality is good on average, but do not expect high cuisine. very friendly staff."
"the most slowly serving in my life. felt like i turned one more year. we ordered 8 small bitterballen and waited 45+ minutes. stuff served everyone in restaurant except us. i literally saw 15+ burgers (would be enough for a whole caw), desserts, drinks and also meat balls. iâm sure they just forgot about us and didnât even say sorry. i just canceled our order and said iâm not gonna pay for the food i canât eat. some girl next to us asked if we want her french fry  "
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
whilst the food we had was ok it was not the best value for money. what i found very annoying was we ordered drinks and asked for tap water as well (it was 36 degrees and we had been cycling all day). i cancelled my drinks order in order to be able to have water! other restaurants happy to give a jug of water in this situation.
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"some teenagers wanted to take-out fries on a sunny sunday, but were told that no takeaway allowed on busy days. they had to order while sitting on the terrace, but no ordinary fries available on the menu. they were forced to choose the fries with a small spare rib, priced at eur  "
the food are very nice but it took 1.5 hour for pur food to come. we have to ask for 3 times and the last one i have to say if the food still not come then we will leave immediatel 
"we chose this restaurant to host a catch up with a group of friends. it was a great location as the restaurant terrace is right on the edge of the beach and there is a playground just in front of it which was ideal for all of the kids. we booked a table from 11-5pm, with the plan that our friends would come and go at various times during the day and we would order food as required. when we first arrived, the staff were friendly enough and checked that we were happy with the table they had arranged. our initial orders were fine, but as the afternoon progressed, the service got slower and slower. this was despite the fact that it wasnt all that busy. we had one vegetarian with us, so we asked for a dish to have the meat removed from it, however when it arrived, the meat was included. on top of that we ordered a couple of things that never came yet they still ended up on the bill. we had one couple arrive at around 2pm and when we went to order extra food we were told that the kitchen was closed. when we pointed out that we had specifically booked the table with the understanding that we would order food throughout the afternoon, the staff advised that they could prepare a limited set of items from the menu. the food eventually came and the bill was amended, but we would have enjoyed our afternoon a lot more without the irritation of the poor service."
"first time in holland, popped in for dinner. waited over 20mins for a bottle of beer to arrive, which after a hot day on the water was not what id hoped for. wasnt able to accept either credit or debit cards either, so lucky my dutch friend, had enough cash to pay for  "

used to visit on a regular basis because dh loved their gyros dish and i liked their lamb chops. i understand their is a new owner and we were not impressed on our last visit. the gyros was bland without the usual spicy garlic flavour he is used to and their lamb chops were no longer accompanied by a thyme flavored sauce but with a brown sauce with a definate maggi flavouring not an improvement at a 
booked for five and no table available when we arrived. table for four was made to fit five food not great but acceptable staff not attentive and one member of staff was very rude to one of our party. avoid is my advice
"i would give this place 5 stars for location, presentation and service. the food however was a let down in my opinion. located just across the old harbour with free parking opposite it and fairly easy access, limani is set in a prime location. the waiters were professional and went the extra mile to cater to our dietary requirements. unfortunately the food was hit and miss. the salmon was great and the salad bar had a reasonable selection. the grilled chicken however tasted like it had served time in the freezer and the rice like it had just come out of an uncle bens bag. it might have just been an unlucky choice for us but im not sure id come back again. "
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
i have visited here quite a few times as i stay regularly at the citta romana resort in which the restaurant is situated. most occasions the service is quite slow but normally friendly staff. the menu is basic with pizza burgers chicken ribs and fish so dont expect fine dining. the food is always hot and the servings are not to bad in size and i do recommend the burger. its nice to sit outside on a summers evening but be aware that at certain times of the year there may be a lot of oil and gas workers there as the site is poplar with working nearby. i come here when i cant be bothered to cook for myself and ive never come away feeling disappointed.
food was very nice. service was slow. only managed to get one drink with our meals.  4 starters 4 mains 4 drinks 10% discount. 80 euros. not bad.  would go back. prawn cocktail is brown shrimps. tappas was really good. half chicken just that.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
today our friends booked a table in this restaurant. we had a set menu with five dish 
we had two days a dinner; not outstanding. but very friendly and helpful staff. one could dine Ã  la carte and also make use of a bbq-buffet.
took a break in this beach restaurant whilst walking on the beac 
we stopped late afternoon for a cup of coffee. unfortunately a very loud woman disturbed us and the other customers.
after waiting for 20+ minutes on just one drink before anyone cared to take our order. then we waited for 50 more minutes only to find out that they had completely forgotten about us. as you can imagine i do not advice going there if you actually want to eat. 
i had the pizza marinara and it was ok but relied too heavily on tinned fish. the vegetable lasagne was better. the service was not very good; there being one person other than the cook doing everything. and he struggled. it was a cold wet monday when we visited so i expect they were not anticipating the ten customers there.
"firstly the staff were very nice, however as a treat i decided to order the black angus steak at nearly 26 euros. however when it arrived it looked way too big for a fillet steak and i couldnt cut into it.....after a bit of sawing i managed to get inside and it was completely raw.....i had ordered medium. i tried chewing a piece that i managed to cut off and it went round and round in my mouth....i couldnt chew it.....so when the waitor came over he took it back to the kitchen.......then about 5 minutes later out it came again.........not sure what the difference was as again i had real difficulty in cutting it...yet again when i managed to saw off a piece it was completely raw inside..what we in britain call blue ? the waiter said that that was how they like it in the netherlands, (so why call it the british pub and why ask patrons how they would like it cooked i wonder)?? he took it away and offered a free coffee...........i said no thanks. anyway we went to pay and they had still charged for that inedible chunk of meat?... the location was great but the food was inedible and the staff, although nice, a bit useless in this situation.....an expensive mistake."
"our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, the place was comfortable but the food was very average - i ordered a stuffed pepper which was pretty much a warm, but raw pepper with a bit of veg inside and cheese melted on top."
the staff was very kind. wine was very nice. food didnât seem to be homemade. tomato soup was very sweet.  we will give it another try though.
"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
"lunch was good, just 2 kroketten with cryspy bread which was good. the cola (it was pepsi, so thats bad enough already) had no sparkly taste, awfull to drink it that way! its a tourist place so people will stop by anyway."
this bar/restaurant has a great spot on the canal but everything else was average.  i wouldnt eat there again.
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often thereâs more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guestâs conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."

good location and awesome entry create great expectations - fair enou 
"for a michelin 1 star restaurant one expects a better service, personal attention, more perfection and higher quality. the staffs are hautain and dont star in friendliness. our impression: arrogance and overdo "
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91â¬ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."

"had a very nice dinner with friend from hendrik-ido-ambacht. our reservations didnt work. we ended up having to wait 15 min. to be seated. the service was good once we did get seated. the food was middle of the road. i had beef steak. the poor old milk cow that gave her life ended up on my plate, good taste but very tuff and chewy. my wife have vegetarian plate that her just love. our friend had rabbit that look good too. "
food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.
"lovely place, great view. need some improvement on the fo "
"the service has been very slow! seems like this place is understaffed, especially in the kitchen. it took the waitressing staff ages taking our order and then bringing the food. my cousins bitterballen were more empty than full and it took an age for her dessert to arrive. it did appear like theyve forgotten to bring it, despite having ordered soon after ordering the tea and cof "
"for lunch its extremely busy, which is good. my omelette was excellent but my wifes tomato soup was from the ah can or alike, which is not what you expect. service is good and fast. prices are very reasonable"
"as well as the service is ok, the menu is very basic and the cooking is medium. there is an opportunity to enjoy a buffet restaurant, the time-frame is rather too short if you are not advised to get in as they start the time-fra "
"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"
we did brunch before at several van der valk restaurant in the netherlands. we are familiar about the concep 
i eat same times for work in this restaura 
"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "
"with 2 friends (total a party of 4) and a bill of 180 for a small piece of meat for me, a large piece of salmon and 2 plates of pasta. the potatoes were old and the sauces were so, so. the waiter was friendly but his co-worker (a young lady of about 25) was very insecure. no typical italian atmosphere. the website looks fine, the menu looks fine, but in th real world: i am never going back to that restaurant. not worth. no value for money."
"we recently had a wine tasting in that restaurant followed by a 4-course-dinner (group of in total 4 people). the dinner was served at the first floor of the building (so not in the restaurant). we do not know if they had to bring the food from downstairs where the kitchen is located, but it took a while before food was served. the service was not good and could be better. they did not pay enough attention to the guests, probably as there were too many people and only few waiters. very often they forgot to tell us what is served on our plates. the food was good, but not special. the price for that dinner was fixed and reasonable for what we got (as we booked for wine tasting and dinner together), so we did not see the separate menues and do not know what it costs to eat a-la-carte. not sure, if we would come back to this restaurant."
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."
"sorry, but poor. rooms are not well insulated, hear everythi "
"the foods when it arrived was not as we requested with the meat medium/rare but more than well done and dry. whilst it started raining and we sat outside, they were shutting down most umbrellas(also ours while not yet finished eating), but left others open were families were having dinner. a bit wei "
"n52Â°5717.3 e7Â°818.6 part of the camping site âde bronzen eikâ, the restaurant looks authentic inside. you can drink and eat in the cafÃ© or in the more quiet side rooms. the german weiÃen beer is available from the beer tap. we enjoyed it very much in april 2012. the restaurant food was a completely different story. the waitresses, who serve you drinks, disappear in the kitchen behind the bar, to prepare your food because there is no chef working in the kitchen. to make the combination of serving drinks and cooking feasible, the part-time cooking is done with microwave and fryer. between serving customers behind the bar, frozen food from the freezer is put in the microwave or fryer. unaware of this practise, we ordered local stew pot and fried sole. the local stew pot was canned food from the wholesale. the fried sole lived to long in the freezer. nothing fresh, nothing tasteful. just examples of inferior pub food. very disappointing. only the drinks were worthwhile visiting this cafÃ©/restaurant."
we have to wait for a few hours in heerenberg so we took this cozy place for a coffee and cake. good place to sit back and relax.
"in a quiet town, main street, this restaurant/bar is situated. you can have a good drink and a (menu based) meal downstairs. and up stairs they have a all you can eat tapas concept. the place is modern and nicely decoreted (fairly new on the inside). they have a nice glass fence-like area where you can look down into the cafÃ©. they have a bar upstairs but the food comes from the kitchen downstairs. the food is good, portion size quite decent and it tastes well. it is above average compared to other concepts. staff serving was fairly young and unexperienced but they did their best."
dark restaurant. bad light.  we had lunch but it wasnt that much.. the staff looks like they wanted to get you leave asap.
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"so you have done a reservation with this restaurant, but arriving at the place results in a closed door. not even a reaction to the reservator. restaurant is not closed or whatsoever.   advise: dont go there."
"we arrived, tired and hungry, an hour before they closed for the day at 5pm and ordered from the menu we were given - we hadnt had lunch. the waitress returned a few minutes later to say the kitchen had already closed and couldnt produce the burgers wed ordered. (why didnt she know that before?) she suggested ordering again and shed see what they could do, but it soon became obvious that everything was off except chips and chicken nuggets, not even a sandwich could be provided. so we ate chicken nuggets (a first for both of us) and watched those around us having similar conversations with the waitress and being served chips to go with their beers. a shame, because the outdoor tables are a lovely place to sit in the afternoon sun with a view of the fort."
"nice location, easy to reach from the highway a27, enough free parking plac "
"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 â¬. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.
"this restaurant is really unreliable. ive had some very enjoyable evenings there and also some forgetable ones. in august this year i had dinner there, excellent crab starter and mussels to follow. good service and a thoroughly enjoyable evenin "
"reasonable for type of facility. buffet breakfast pricey but good. dinner, reasonable for this type of hotel. room up to date and clean. location is convenient"
"we were wanting a reasonable substantial early evening meal and choose this brasserie close to the brand brewery. i selected the uitsmijter with ham and cheese at â¬7.50 and my wife the toasted focaccia at â¬5.75 also with ham and cheese. our friends choose the prawn pasta and the uitsmijter with courgette, mushroom and speck at similar prices. unexpectedly, the focaccia also came with salad accompaniment and chips and the uitsmijters also had salad accompaniments. all good food and sufficient for our appetites although the toasted focaccia was larger than needed to feel reple "
"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but iâm a little disappointed by the service."
the local soup (limburgse mosterd soup) was delicious. the french fries very good. the rest of the meal (meat and fish) good but not memorable.
"friendly staff, food was good perhaps slightly expensive for what they offered.  interior a bit dated."
"very poor service, poor quality food, badly presented. busy road running by the terrace, very annoying. not worth the bother!"
"nice setting, substandard service.  coffey  and pancake not brought at the same time. voll au vent made from frozen chicken strips"
today had a poor lunch experience in our witte 
nothing special reasonable choices but high prices. no direct competition. vieuws ok but noisy moters and cars
"not impressed, vol au vent made with chickenstrips from the makro, side salades clearly bought readymade. french fries looked nice but hard  inside. no toilets for handicapped ."
5 of us had lunch here while waiting for a car repair. all had different things and all were poor. decor was stuck in the 70s and service was minimal.

"terrible, they gave me a beet burger, it was a little piece of beet, nothing more. cost me 16 euros. never again."
"first weve waited forever to order, then our drinks took very long to come and finally half an hour and no one came for the check even thou we asked 2 times...."
"the place has attractive, casual vibe but the first thing you will notice is the gray smoke from the kitchen. the only smoke-free room was very co "
you have to walk a bit to reach the brewery. the service and food were good. they have many different types of beers.
"we come from the northeastern us and this feels like a very northeasternly kind of place - from the atmosphere to the pricy pub menu and craft beer selection. the menu is more limited if going after 5 p.m. (as of this writing), with options for burgers, fish and chips, and similar entrees. the beet soup was delicious, as was the fish and chips. beer-lovers will find a number to choose from, with an option for flights. itâs a really beautiful walk from the train (look for the windmills by the bridge); go when the weather is nice."
when the food came it was lovely but the overall service experience detracted from this complete

"stopped off at brouwerij hoop when visiting the old dutch village of zaandijk; they offer brewery tours but we were there at the wrong time so just had a drink, or two at the bar area. several offerings from their own craft beers later we left refreshed. warm and a pleasant pit stop, but just averag "
"first of all pay attention! the atmosphere can deceive you but this place is miserable! they do not care about the customers and their orders!! ive ordered extra baked hamburgers and i get unbaked hamburger! although they saw that i could not eat, they took the hole price!"
"the chicken was still raw on the inside. the steak, even thought we said medium-well, was very bloody. the portion size of the fries was meager, to say the least. my high-light was he bitterlemon. never ever order the chai latte. and they do not listen to the complaints. i will not come here again. thank you."
"we just got ripped off 4 euros from this establishment. we ordered a mix of raw beef and cheese for 9.5 euros. then at the bill it is 13.5 euros, billing 2 individual dishes. we told her we ordered the mix and she said it is not on the menu anymore, except she gave me the menu i ordered while spelling and pointing at the mix, and she never said it was not available. avoid this place, they are not honest!"
"hubby and i stayed at an airbnb just behind this shop and popped in one morning. they didnt know the prices of a few items i asked about, which seemed weird. overall, it seemed a little bare and underwhelming with higher prices than i would have expected."
"the place is nice, but the service was horrible. the food wasnât bad, but the worst is that the people that worked there were rude and were xenophobic to us."
*food was nice and delicious but not worth the experienc 
"terrible experience in this place, the food is not great. the service is awful, they say we are not allowed to give water to our kids using ther bottles, unless you ordered from them. what closed minded owners or leadership does not want kids to drink water ? unacceptable, terrible place. do not recommend!!!"
we arrived at about 3:30pm. ordered and my gf got the wrong dish which they quickly corrected. the wait staff is not very attentive and every time we needed to order we had to call the waiter over. they do not seem very customer service oriented.
good location & be fair food is not  
"a cafe was out of cheesecake and carrotcake, ordered a waffle, but had to wait for 30 min. a menu and service could be better"
this is a restaurant for travellers who want to have proper basic food without twists. service was friendly and fast enough to be ok. food and beer was ok. ok without surprises is in my scales ok.
"between us we had a blt, burger and chicken salad, and my son had an espresso cream that he loved. not many choices in this touristy area. we rented bikes and went over the bridge to get away and found this place. did the job. note they only take cash."
"i had been in wolfsend for a lunch with my chlidren. we arrive at the same time that another family with children. we wait for half an hour for having our drinks. some other tables, that had arrived later than us, had the drinks and the food before our table and also before the other table with children. after waiting an hour, i ask the waitress for my food, she brought us a meal that we had not asked for and after rectifying, she brought our cold. they asked me to pay for the food i havenât ordered. of course, i didnât pay for i "

"we came in around 2:30 pm, the restaurant was not very full and we didnât get our food until 3:49 pm. the waitress never put in our order and forgot about it for the whole hour. a family sitting next to us came in twenty minutes after us and they received their food first, so we asked the waitress and she realized she never put it in and didnât even bother to check on us for the past hour. due to her limited english, she apologized in a very rude way. the food was okay though, but overpriced. will not recommend to anyone. "
"i wanted soup and salad and a sandwich... mustard soup tasted too heavily of mustard from the jar, maybe it should taste like that? they didnât understand simple greens for salad, but i did not want their entree salads that were the most expensive items on lunch menu. they did comply, serving me a few leaves in a bread bowl, which could not be cut or dressed with the delicious olive oil. i saved it for my sandwich "
"it was a beautiful, warm day and the outdoor tables were a great place for lunch. service was acceptable--attentive at first and then less so when the place filled up. burgers were good. nothing astonishing, mid-range prices. tip: it seems no one in the netherlands accepts credit or non-nl debit cards. plan to bring cash."
poor service and no guest caring. we had to leave for a certain time and they kept made late. we are not going back.
stopped in here after being dropped off by a bus tour to visit zaanse schans. we got soup (pretty sure the spinach soup had a chicken stock base so be careful vegetarians) and a sandwich. it was nice to get warm and out of the wind and rain but the food was average and the service the same.
dreadful experience at this restaurant where they refused to serve us for turning up 10 minutes late!!! the chef was shockingly rude and we will never return.
"the staff was friendly, and we ordered the menu with an ok price, the rest of the menu was quite expensive and we were surprised on how big the dishes were but how incredibly small portions were. the food was great quality but i would have needed 3 menues to fulfill my stomach and im a slim person that doesnt eat too muc "

we entered with kids to eat a muffin and drink a hot chocolate. waiter didnt want us to seat to eat a muffin. if you want to eat you have to take away...  bakery next door was good...
we had lovely evening here with our family.we did find menu bit limited and most of us ended having burgers as not too much to choose from.friendly staff and very helpful.children enjoyed a swim in lake and play area popular.outside heaters on for diners wishing to eat outside.
"a nicely located restaurant where they serve a nice meal! went there recently and enjoyed the food and drinks we were served, however the service was mediocre. friendly, but not very professional. long waits, not addressing our wishes in regards to what was served when. apparently they understood this themselves as well as we were offered coffee on the house at the end of the evening to compensate this lack of attention."
"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "
didnt get offered the menu that others seemed to have (eggs bacon). waited half hour for luke warm soup . nice enough staff. but very dated menu
"after a ceremony at the nearby war cemetery our party of eleven descended on the schoonoord. fortunately i had made a reservation as our visit coincided with the annual remembrance celebrations for the battle of arnhem, & the schoonoord seems to be a popular haunt for participants & visitors in this respect. consequently the place was extremely busy & the staff stretched in dealing with the substantial number of guests. service was slow & a bit random, & it took a long time to get the bill. as for the food, it was affordable âpubâ food, nothing to rewrite home about. the wok dish seemed to be appreciated by those of our party who had it, but the deconstructed ribs were so-so. verdict; overall, pretty unremarkable. "

"after waiting for 20 minutes, and no one of the waiters showing up, we left for another place to have lunch."
"firstly, the food when it actually arrived was quite good, but having waited 30 minutes for a drink, then a further 50 mins (80 in total) for a cheese banquette, im less than impressed. the waitresses were friendly and polite, but this is the third time ive eaten here and my experience is always the same "

"early evening snack meal. ease of parking. service average, however, food of good standard. met our expectations for a casual meal."
"the food was plentiful but ordinary. we are of dutch descent and i speak dutch quite well and had no problem making myself understood. the female server was aware we are canadian and she spoke good english so we had no problem understanding each other. she took care of the drinks. a young male server gave us a menu. we spoke in dutch. he left and went behind the counter and laughed and make fun of us. when he returned with our meal and later asked us if everything was to our liking he deliberately spoke dutch as fast as possible which was difficult to understand. we replied by saying pardon in english and he then spoke in english, slowly. im giving an average rating for service - the young woman was fine but the service rating for the young man is poor. that young man needs an attitude adjustment! if you cannot be respectful towards tourists who are doing their best with your language then you should not be working in the service industry."
was part of a tour group of 30 that had pre-booked lunch last sunday. we arrived 20 mins late due to road closures for arnhem commemoration to find no table available and worse no food - despite the fact that we had pre-ordered baguettes the day before! appalling service and no apology from staff member who couldnt care less and shrugged her shoulders! so much for dutch hospitality. avoid this place.

"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this âbrasserieâ is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."
"we attended this restaurant on two occasions .the first (for a lunch) , we had a good experience. sadly the second experience wasnt so good ! we called in for an evening meal and ordered our choice > the restaurant was quite busy and we noted the owner/manager was sat near the front door observing . in fact he had been sat in that position and seat we we had been there befor "
"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"the restaurant is located within a short walk from the airborne museum, and we had lunch here after our museum vis "
the best thing about this restaurant is that it is just next door to the airborne museum. it is in the midst of a parking lot and hence very well positioned. we went there in lunch time and placed an order but our order was forgotten by the service staff. since we were getting delayed we had to be satisfied with a cup of coffee. the restaurant was elegant and staff were courteous but we were out of luck! we had to rush to giethoorn and hence left.
"this restaurant is located in a building next to the villa with the same name, housing the airborne museum. flowers everywhere told the story of the new management, since january 1st. service was a bit chaotic and the seating somewhat cramped, but the lunch menu offered a selection of simple but tasty food. i selected the bread with smoked salmon and a draft swinckels beer. the beer was cold and the salmon plate was prepared with due care. the test of careful preparation lies in the state of the capers on the smoked salmon. here the chef had rinsed and dried the capers, removing the awful brine taste. a good score for the food. but when i add the service, seating and price level i arrive at a three point rating."
"weâve visited the restaurant and enjoyed our 3 course dishes. when we compare the quality / price, the price is to high for the quality of the food. food was good."
i was very hungry after leaving the museum and convenience was high on my priority list. the selection here is pretty limited. i had croquettes and lobster soup. inexplicably the lobster soup had shrimp in it but the broth did taste of lobster. the 2 croquettes were huge. it was all fine but not outstanding and not really cheap. it served my purpose but i would look elsewhere if i had some time. 
been there for lunch with whole family. for kids not interesting menu and for adults the salads are different and worthy to try. the rest is normal dutch boring lunch food. nice place though and super good service. an average to good mark.
"been here twice, forgot the first time -- that is typical for the place "
"like the title says, cosy and nice but the food was a bit disappointing. did not reply to what the titles suggested. was ok but not challenging."
this place has a nice outdoor seating and it is nicely maintained. drinks and snacks arw quite good though a bit expensive. but is doea have a nice view and a history.
"nicely located, decent dinner menu, lunch somewhat limited. beautiful old villa with friendly girls waiting your table. when we had our lunch the restaurant wasnt full, yet it took a very long time before the food came ou "
"i made a reservation in the middle of the week, close to the big airborne event. the interior van be defined as tastefully selected variety of colors and forms,shapes but not my choice. it appears to me as cold and distant. and i experience that in the presence of staff as wel "
during our recent visit to airborne museum me and my wife decided to have diner at this place. unfortunately after 50 min of waiting for a steak (medium rear) and home made burger we were served with something that looked like a steak but tasted like grilled rubber. i suspect they grilled frozen chunk of meat and warmed it in a microwave. i refused to eat it. we shared my wife home made burger. i do not want to advertise mac donalds but for its taste and look and price they are much better not mention the price.to our surprise when it came to pay the bill they tried to charge for that rubber that is listed in they menu as beef fillet. keep away!
"our annual trip to oosterbeek with a market garden veteran was earlier this year than our usual september visit. we always visit the hartenstein@laurie a couple of times and always look forward to it. this year i needed gluten free and the staff seemed to struggle a little with it. after initially saying they could adapt anything on the menu, it became apparent that they couldnt and i ended up with a (small) plate of vegetables with some melted chee "
"visited this restaurant with a friend of mine. we got seated in a quite busy restaurant and ordered something to drink while waiting for menus written in english. the menus and drinks arrived swiftly, and once decided what to order we put down the menus on the table. during the next 20 minutes we watched our waiter seating and taking food/drink orders from at least three tables (all of which had arrived later than us). the waiter simply ignored us - we even watched him small talking with other guests while we were waiti "
"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at â¬19 each! we couldnât finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to â¬46! i canât help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. thereâs many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
the restaurant looks cosy but sitting downstairs in the aterlier is different. good portion for lunch and it is delicious. service is a bit slow.
"bakery schuld originates from de town oldebroek, (producing the local cake klinkertjes) but has also a branch in elburg, comprising of a historic windmill in working order and associated buildings, where a bakery, a bakery shop and a cafe are situated. a target for a very interesting visit. ample free parking is offered around the complex. we visited to buy several packages of klinkertjes, but when we were paying at the cashiers counter, a member of the staff, probably not in the customer-comes-first mode, put a heavy box on some of our purchases. we had to get fresh packages from the shop to replace the flattened cakes. room for improvement in the customer service department."
we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef iâve had in the years iâve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit âquasi-ruralâ venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the â¬25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. iâll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i donât ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldnât make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesnât agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i donât wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."
this restaurant has wonderful ambience; shabby chic decor with wonderful holiday decor. definitely unique in the netherlan 
"its a great location and looks really trendy, but there was such poor service. the waitress walked passed us 7 times ignoring us when we wanted to order food. had to get the attention of another waitress instea "
good food and a very nice looking bistr 
"had dinner here with my girlfriend. the bistro is small and friendly, but we did not really enjoy the food very much. it was ok, but not what we had expected. the service was good and friendly though. dont think i will be back here again. "
"service in this restaurant is extremely bad, after 20 mins no one came to take our order. surprisingly they have 4 waitresses with such service. finally one came after we waved for her. my husband ordered melted goat cheese, that must be a piece of bad cheese. it tasted moldy. i will never go there again !!"
"its been a year since my last visit, but i still dont know what to think of this restaurant. it offers a nice sit-down in the outdoor seating area at the main pedestrianised street of the fortified historic center of elburg, where you can watch the passing tourists and they offer nice coffee and cake for the expected elevated dutch prices, but the hospitality still needs a brush-up as i mentioned in my last review, to prevent the restaurant to descend into the category tourist trap. an example: we were with three and due to the position of chairs and tables against the restaurant front, and space only for two at a table, i occupied a separate table. these tables were very close to each other, mind. when i finished my coffee and cake, the waitress cleared my table immediately and inquired, if i desired another drink or the bill. this while my family at the next table hadnt finished there cake yet. talking about throughput in a restaurant. by the way, only half of the tables where occupied. no, i didnt feel welcome and a three point rating, mostly given because the nice spot in elburg, is the best i can do."
"not good, also not very bad. just nothing really stands out here and thatâs too bad as the place seems to have all to make it good cosy and upscale place."
what a shame! good food wasted by terrible service. we had booked a table for 6.30 and arrived to be told that the table was not available yet and to go and sit at the bar (no complimentary drink) at 6.50 we were offered a table in their party room which was totally unatmospheric. at 7-15 we were offered an acceptable table. we received no apologies at all. the food was in fact really good but what a shame about the standard of service!!!
the go 
"the terrace is nice, but service absolutely not good: questions about menu were unanswered, made us feel unimportant , food was not as to be expected in relation to price ( dinner) , side dishes seemed very leftover and warmed up. spinach was potatoepuree with few leaves of spinach?, i would not recommend this restaurant ."
"we ordered salmon with fries, it came without fries, the fries arrived when my daughter had finished. my son ordered tenderloin stake, they forgot to bring it, the order arrived when everyone else had finished and it was a plate of little pieces of meat, on top of a lot of salad. i ordered a grilled goat cheese salad, what arrived is regular goat cheese on top of salad, without salad dressing and they said they had no vinegar. my fatherâs shrimp salad and carpaccio were the only correct dishes. they kept on sending new waiters, who did not know how to react. beautiful town, surely there must be better restaurants around here."
"mediocre food, sloppy service and the ambiance of a buffet-restaurant in a railway station. to be avoided."
"reading previous reviews is unfortunate.  we only came for drinks and snacks and were welcomed and received very nicely. good hospitality,nice beer and good service. cant say otherwise.  try for yourself and make your own judgement."
"went here without a reservation around 20:30 on a saturday evening. we asked for a table for dinner, but inside was fully packed. we were seated outside. the waiter came 1 min. later to tell us there was a table available. this table was a big one for 8/10 pax, but next to the toilets. a big downside were the aggressive flies around our food and drink "
"stopped here for coffee and cake as views were the best in town.  service was a bit lacking, otherwise a decent vist"
"awful experience: 15 minutes before receiving the menu, 1 hour before receiving the first ordered dish, 1 hour and half before receiving the second dish. all of the other customer have been served except us. we have asked for an explaination but the excuse was the kitchen is very busy, despite all the customer were serv "
"the restaurant is located just outside the city centre with a nice view from the terrace over the harbour. the restaurant is dark and the food is ok, but not special."
lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
"restaurant de tijd is located in rijsbergen at the old road from breda to antwerp. the restaurant has an unassuming dining room, a large room for private partying and a terrace overlooking the road that was build in 1812 under napoleon ru "
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
"perfect if you are into toddlers and like quirky austrian dresses on dutch waitresses. loud, unorganized and near average food. good beers. people changing diapers on the next table. parents running after their offspring. dont get me wrong, its crowded on a sunny day. has a playground. mass cant be wrong. just not for me. "
"dinner here with colleagues. solid food, excellent dessert, good, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. difficulty using credit card to pay."
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"nice location, but a nothing special type of ambiance and service. food is cheap and ok, but again nothing special. really a shame because this location on the dobbe plas could be a lot better and special"
we went there with some friends in ju 
this restaurant has been in nootdorp for quite some years. to date we never heard from anybody in the village that actually dined there. so we went ahead and had a g 
the staff (especialy the owners) are not really on the friendly side. waiters took a long time the present menus. then it took also a long time to ask for a drink. in my opinion this can be done or asked when presenting the me 
fast food kind of food. kebap with a style. still kebap. it is not bad. but it is not superb. lots of food fast served. baklava is expensive and not finest.
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulÃ©e, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "

"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little cafÃ©. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"went for a sunday afternoon drink in this place. we had a good hour out, i would recommend the chicken bites they taste very good. staff is very friendly and takes good time. the coffee is good. it is not too busy. due to the nice weather we sat outdoor."
"atmosphere ok, food average (minimal for the price). we tried it and will not go again as others are way better price wise."
"when you choose to travel by car for a visit to tapas restaurant olijf, the multilevel car park boekenberg is especially suited for the purpose. the pedestrian way-out drops you right behind the restaurant and the parking fee is moderate. the web site of olijf contains this excellent advice. the restaurant is located in a historic building in the voorstraat, one of the streets that are left over from the old village spijkenisse. the atmosphere of the restaurant can be soothing, except that there were somewhat more flies in residence than you could wish in a restaurant with an open kitchen. later on the evening one fly decided to have a bath in my wine glass. brrr... furthermore, the somewhat irritating music over the speaker system clashed with the restaurant appointments. it is my opinion that music in shops or restaurants is mostly there for the pleasure of the staff, not for the customer. service of the staff was friendly, but mechanically. the dutch are not very good in hospitality and serving customers, not like italy, where hospitality and serving customers is an art. furthermore, our waitress omitted to bring clean plates for the main course; a grave mistake. it was also difficult to attract the attention of the staff. in the end it was impossible to get our bill presented to the table, so we decided to take our coats and ask for the bill at the counter. but how was the food then? olijf is a tapas restaurant, where you share with your table companion divers small portions, ordered from the menu. generally, the food was well prepared. sauces are to be avoided, they come out of a bottle. i must say the slices egg pancake with salmon and cream cheese filling were delicious and also the pork medallions with bacon wrapping were cooked perfectly. however, later on my digestion system told me that possibly the chef of olijf uses flavour enhancers in the preparation of the food. maybe salt msg. (also called ve-tsin in chinese restaurants). i may be wrong, but i am very sensitive for this additive. what shall i say about olijf. it can be a very nice restaurant when some easy improvements are made by the management. but they do something right. the restaurant was busy on this weekday and mostly with regular customers."
it is a good place with a fairly tasty food. tried tapas and it was fine. i didnt pay so i dont know the average per person. portions are not big so heavy eaters need to watch out.
"maybe they had an off day, but the last time we were here for a tapas surprise menu, the fish was tough and the meat was cold. and as it was not that crowded, it was strange that it took far to long to serve the fo "
"what a surprise to find in a small village in rotterdam area a tapas restaurant, very nice place and very nc tapas, too."
we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"
"staying in the (slightly isolated) hotel this was the choice for dinner, and a good option to "
"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant
"recently we visited the restaurant, and there was no table available in a light area. we asked for a table near the window, however most tables were occupied by flexworkers who installed their laptop or backpacks and were nowhere to be seen. the manager, when asked replied that it was no problem to them because they welcome everyon "
"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crÃ¨me brulÃ©e with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"
the goo 
30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"we had a family lunch at palkinto, really nice place, the food was simple but okay. chill environment."
"we were looking forward for a nice evening and were excited to dine in this high ranked restaurant. when we got there, we were greeted without any kindness, rather as if we were not welcome. when we were seated we got a little amus-bouche which waa very good, but we had to wait for the menu for at least 10 minutes and ask 3 times for a bottle of water. in my opinion, for a restaurant in this category, absolutely unacceptable. the lady that served the bread, which came in three different types, wasnât really able to explain the difference and seemed more annoyed than willing to do her job or at least be friendly. i decided to go with the 4 course menu, the first course was lobster and mackerel which was good, but already a little disappointing, as the portion was really small and the sauce was too sour and i missed the light sweetness of the lobster, what makes it so special. the white wine we ordered, a light summer wine, had room temperature and just put on a small table next to us, so that we had to ask the service (several times) to put it in the refrigerator again. the quality of the food decreased from course to course, just like the serviceâs motivation to make an effort for us to have a pleasant evening. we then decided to forgo the desert and just stop this nonsense. the whole evening was a pure disappointment and absolutely not worth the money we spent there!! "
the food and the service are really good. but: when i left the restaurant i was still hungry and so was my (female) colleague. from a three course meal of round about 50 euros i think i can at least expect not to be hungry anymore.
"this was our third trip to villa la ruche. pleasant atmosphere and friendly, efficient service but the food was rather disappointing as was the case during our second visit last year. we ordered a 5 course surpise menu this time. the third dish with sweetbread and biff was very tasty and very appealing. the remaining dishes lacked character and taste. in addition, the lobster served in the second dish was partially raw. i doubt very much we will be going back."
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone.

"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p.

this place needs new management. food and coffee (illyð) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.
we visited here on our trip for a quick lunch near the city where our friends were marri 
the friendly hipster staff makes up for the minimalistic non-hipster motif and a few regulars who treat it like their own truck driver pit stop. the quality of their products including their pastry seems out of place considering there is not much competition or a discerning public but their efforts should be rewarded by a visit while passing through or instead of sitting indoors for coffee chats. a few neighborhood fans certainly dont want to see this coffee corner go even if it doesnt exactly fit the neighbourhood picture. i agree. the sleepy town needs some pepping up!
it was a busy friday evening and the two girls working front of house were very busy. the service was therefore very slow but very friendly.  the food was good but they needed more staff.
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasnât a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anywayâ¦ waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"we booked a dinner with my husband and my son, sold as live cooking buffet... its just another of those all you can way place with a very large variety of food where you can eat everything but the quality isnt for sure something remarkable."
we had dinner here with our fami 
"the lunch menu was a bit boring. i had a beef carpaccio, which was reasonably executed, but the portion of bread was very small. service was ok, but a bit slow seeing at they seemed to have 6 serving staff. i wouldnt go again as there are better options in the area."
the drink arrived when we had already finished the appetizers and i had to ask for the napkins twice after the first course. fairly good dishes but with definitely not involving combinatio 
"evening meal with colleagues, menu choice is limited and service is ok but not quick..... you have to make sure that you grab the attention of the waiter otherwise you will sit there all evening being ignored potentially. food quality is good...."
"if you came here as part of a keukenhof coach tour or wedding festivity, both happening during our meal you probable be quite happy but we came to meet with family to chat and relax. both food and wine menu ok. i had carpaccio to start, dutch lamb with white asparagus (in season) for mains and good selection of cheese for desert. considering price level service was patchy and not out waitresses fault just overloaded - 3 requests for wine list and having to wait for water glasses to return from washer before we could have some. nothing especially local about the experience. "
"resto is located in the same building and complex as the senior citizens home.  it is rather. interior is spacious and decor is just right. food was fine and done well, although nothing that stands out. service was also fine."
"this is a very nice restaurant in many respects. the interior is very nice and excellent service. i think the chef also really knows how to cook as shown by the good taste of several of the dishes, with special compliments for the french fries. however, some serious problems need to be fixed. an almost complete lack of healthy vegetables is nowadays hardly acceptable anymore. furthermore, all dishes were far too high on calories, e.g. the pumpkin soup, and especially the dessert was completely over the top with too much cookies and other stuffing ingredients. so if they adapt to modern times and give much more attention to healthy ingredients, that by the way most often can also taste great, this restaurant has a great future. "
"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesnât seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. weâll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chefâs cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be â¬2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
"excellent food, could not fault it for freshness and tast "
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"the staff are really not caring or professional here most of the time. the food is not the best but its ok (average), if the staff had a better attitude and where professional this would not be such a bad place to eat but with bad service and average food. we have tried this place a few times and every time we think why did we do it. its a hit and miss. and we go expecting the hit only to miss most of the time. would not recommend."
"not satisfying at all, staff was not really caring (students having a job, but absent), food was ok but too much and not really 4star level, for a top3 restaurant really not where it should be, will prefer other restaurant next time"
we visited this restaurant last week with 5 people (incl. our 5 year old so 
youâd think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30â¦ but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. wonât be coming back for breakfast thatâs for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"good food, nice people, but no respect for any covid-19 measure. no 1.5m distance between tables, no masks, no qr  check, nothing. a true insult to the public and other restaurants who do respect the guidelines."
"my family-in-law goes here all the time apparently. they are not foodies. the decor of this restaurant looks beautiful. but its kind of restaurant with an identity crisis. is it italian, or greek? cause they are known to be italian (in my family-in-law at least), but really the menu is greek, with also one dish of risotto (which then makes it italian-greek?). food is a lot and greasy. not very satisfying. i liked the tzatiki and pita bread, but thats really all i liked. "
nothing to get excited about. pretty good quality mediterranean meals. the staff are very friendly and welcoming.
"we went out for a family dinner to this restaurant. while the welcome was very friendly and warm and the staff and the manager very friendly we were disappointed in the delays in serving our food. the presentation of the food was super but it took way too long for our food to be served and when it finally did get served it was almost cold. that spoilt everything! my husband expressed his disappointments directly to the manager so we hope that the next time we go there, if we do, the serving of the food is well improved!"
we went to plein 22 for a quick dinner on a friday nig 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we enjoyed a great get together here, where the facility was perfect, the coffee was plentiful and the baked treats were beautiful. plenty of outdoor seating as well from full sun to pleasant shade. why 2 stars? i pre ordered a vegan lunch and it was just laughably bad. it consisted of two bare rice cakes, half of a sliced tomato and a few bits of sliced cucumber. it was probably 100 calories of tasteless bits of food. they made absolutely no effort to make something decent. its as if no one has a phone with google."
"the rib eye was tough and cold, vegetables were scarce and not tasty.when we said that the meat was tough, they did nothing. people must know how this restaurant has deteriorated because there was hardly anybody dining, only a few having snacks in the terrace. it is a shame that they do not serve good meat but maybe trying to get rid of whatever they had."
"young couples, friends, families, everybody feels at home here. the staff is friendly and laid back."
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10â¬ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"what can i say. unpleasant staff you have to call by ringing a bell (inside) as there is no service. a double espresso? two shots of powdered coffee i wouldnt give pigs price euro 4,60!!!!!! its that i had to wait for someone but this is a tourist trap stuck in the 70s apart for the pricing. no wonder it is so empty. if i was the owner i would upgrade or enjoy my pension"
we vist the pyramide van austerlitz on a regular basis. we always begin with one of the walking routes in the woods and round the pyramid then we end up in the big playground with our small children. there are enough things to choose from so every child has something to keep them entertained also in the summer months they haveaarcade a sort fairground with attractions such as a train and bumper cars. the restaurant itself is very old and self service the restaurant could be improved and the toilets need to be cleaned on a more regular basis because they always stink and look really dirty.
poor and shabby place with much potential. the place is literally 100 years old. there is a pretty cool playground and arcade hall next to it. the campings are very nearby and also the pyramide. a landmark built by napoleo 
"the location is at the begin of the pyramide complex, not far from the parking place. next to the restaurant there is a big playground but its not open during the winter ti "
"bar and restaurant. i was here for lunch, and my 2 year old daughter and i were here alone for most of the time. maybe on other occasions its more lively. lunch was simple, service slow, and the setting was a bit dark for mid-day."
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (ârevenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.
chalet helenaheuvel is an ideal place to stop for drinks or lunch when exploring the beautiful kaapse bossen (forest) in the utrechtse heuvelru 
"great coffee, average soup and sandwiches. slow service on a saturday afternoon, maybe due to a party. too expensive."
"the âde oranjerieâ is located inside the park of the doorn huis, the ambience is charming and class; the service is friendly but not very quick; the dishes are well finished. very good solution for a brunch or a tea break."
"tasty food, many small dishes. the good tempranillo was a little expensive though. friendly people, service with a smile!"
you know instantaneously when youâre in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteurâs admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."
"amis restaurant is a lovely, quaint place to have dinner with business partners, friends and/or family. staf was friendly, helpful, and we had a nice ti "
i did eat here people are not caring anyone they are not working only walking they dont care for the coustemer. also food is not so good.  i never want go again
"so all in all, right to the point here, this was once upon a time a good restaurant, a great one ev "
this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the âsmellsâ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... donât go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
stale wings lukewarm burgers  lukewarm fries  its a recipe for food poisoning.  holland ruined kfc for me. its just no good!
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"went for a friday night dinner. small place with nice ambiance located in the center of veenendaal. we reserved a table (the place is not big) and ordered drinks and a three course menu. starter was tomato soup (very tasty) with smoked chicken and beer-battered fried mushrooms with walnuts and salad. starters were very good. thereafter we had chicken satay and white fish. compared to the starters these dishes were a bit of a miss. although presented very nice and good the taste was a bit bland. with a little more effort (marinating the satay meat and seasoning the fish) they could improve it. the potential is there! we ordered the creme brulee as dessert and the chefs surprise. very well portioned and tasty! all in all (for the price) we had an excellent dinner and enjoyed our stay. service was good and done by some young girls, we waited for the starter and they actually forgot us but the made the apologies and as we were not in a hurry it was all fine. so, for a good bite and reasonable price this is a good place."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so donât plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
"the food was cold and tasted like soap, server was simply rude, inside the burger the meat was still nearly frozen in the center. the fries tasted gross like someone had put a cleaning supply or soap on them absolutely awful, ate at mcdonalds many times, never again at this venue."
arrived here for lunch just to be told there is no babychair available and that the restaurant is not actually â for kid 
"a lot of rats. the food was the worst i ever tasted, everything was dirty. and on top of that the service was awful. wouldnât recommend."
words cant describe how trash the service is.  its a shame how they treat customers. if you want a horrible experience... go!
wouldnât recommend !! they have zero respect for customers. they treat people like animals and if you say something about it they donât appreciate it !! please donât waste your money and time !!
"not even worth one star! if your black do not go! they will put your food on the ground, and tell you to pick it up! and if you say something about it ,they will call the police on you! im very dissapointed ,the way they treath black people is not right!"
"didnât like my visit att all, food is trash. service not good att all. they are so mean to alot of people. so basiclly donât waist your money. itâs not worth it."
"classical dutch pub. typical brown interior. we wanted a small lunch, and that is what they are good  "
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "
had dinner here with my wife and our 2-year-old daughter. stayed in the hotel (separate review 
"this pizza restaurant that is located in the center of town close to the main shopping street, bars and cafe "
we was here at a sunday. they was about to close but we got pizzas. very friendly waiters. the bosses are good an tasty. outside sitting possible. prices are too high for pizza. from 12 euro and up.
"the entrance and inside was nice and looked great. friendly waiter. nice food but i missed my sour creme with the fijtas. other than that, it was nice."
"the restaurant looks great, its has a very nice ambiance. the waitress was really friendly but she couldnt give us any recommendation. we started with nachos with cheese and meatloaf which was very tasty. we also had carpaccio, this was okay but way to much salad... ive ordered for the main course the argentinian steak well done. it tasted okay in my opinion it was a bit boring... the fries were tasty, side dish again a bit boring... we had a good time, the terrace is nice, the staff friendly. the price is okay, but im not sure if i will go there again. "
"restaurant looked so inviting on the website, but on arrival discovered a restaurant that was hazy and smelt awful from people smoking inside. decided to find another restaurant."
we were with a large family to celebrate someones birthda 
this an average (pancake) restaurant. pancakes are fine did not try the other dishes. it has a small terrace and pleasant service. not a place to go for fine dining.
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
we dropped by for a quick bite. it is at the centrum and close to oypo museum. the staff is very friendly.
"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"lunchroom t schild is a sandwich restaurant in the city center of rijssen. the positive side of t schild is, that there is a large outside sit-down area, where you can enjoy watching the saturday afternoon life in downtown rijssen go by. the service of the waitresses was a bit bumbling and unpolished; to be encountered in the netherlands unfortunately too often. the recommended home-made walnut cake was dry and nothing special and the hot ham and cheese sandwich my companion ordered, was obviously assembled in haste without sufficient care and served without appropriate cutlery.only the prices were in the expected (high dutch) bracket. i shall avoid lunchroom t schild in the future."
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i donât know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
i paid 30â¬ for 2 pizza and after 2days still dont have food no food no money back !! guy on reception cant speak english
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"when we visit the netherlands, all our kids seem to want to do is grab something out of the febo wall. the febo wall is a wall where there are small windows where you can see snack . you pay the machine and open the window of choice and get the snack you paid for. this magical snack wall offers croquet, cheese souffle, frikandel. actually just fast food. it is fun to see how many people enter, choose, pay, grab a snack and are on their way. obviously, the food is what it is, junk food, but well.. once in a while we all indulge!"
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the tableâ¦.. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . iâve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
"this restaurant is a restaurant that has good and tasteful food, but with a little bit of high prices. the service of the staff is okÃ©, but not that special.this restaurant had a good location if you want to have a diner before going to see a movie, because its near the cinema. the choice of food is poor and i preferred some more options. i must say that what they served, tasted very nice. i chose a fish dish and it was prepared good. i enjoyed my time here and maybe i will go back again. "
this is one of these all you can eat restaurants that thrive on keeping you waiting for food - whilst serving you overpriced drinks..... euro 5.35 for a glass of wine 
"very good caprese, but not a great pizza nor atmosphere. prices are relatively high for the quality. service is friendly."
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
"our last experience was not the best, me and my partner both had the burger from the menu. i asked mine to be topped with a fried egg and that was no problem. when the two burgers arrived at the table, mine was perfect and with the egg as requested, but my partner was not satisfied since her burger was very under cooked. we mentioned this and we were told that this was no problem to eat, since it was beef from the should "
visited this place with the family . food was oke not convincing but oke. the karma shoarma (vegan) 12 euro was in my point of view way overpriced 
we had an amazing party but the toilets were ridiculous. the ladies line was so long and they werent even using all the ladies toilets. girls were crying and the security was aggressive. i watched a girl pee in her pants and try to go through and the security stopped her. never mind the fact that there were atleast 5 open womens toilets when this happen 
"worst place ever. not too mention theyâre expensive, that i can deal with. drinks in plastic glasses, fine. but having to queue 45(!) minutes to go to the ladies, thatâs just outrageous. especially as you also have to pay for this ridiculously poor service! thereâs certain standards that have to be met and propper access to toilets is one of the most important. if u cannot service your public then sell less tickets. this club tries to establish its self as upscale but in reality, itâs a dump. "
"nice for hippies our would-be amsterdam people, but nothing special. go north across the noordzee channel and you will find much nicer and authentic places..."
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"whilst the service was pleasant the food was not great. the goatâs cheese cannelloni was very heavy with thick pasta and the kale quiche was quite flavourless. my friendâs burger was also rather dry. this would have been forgivable until they allowed a couple to bring in their frankly enormous dog, which is bad practice for an eatery in my opinion. we were left unimpressed."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go. "
"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. itâs at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say âignore visitingâ and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and donât bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so donât mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
"great place to be on a sunny day. very comfortable lounge furniture invites to relax when having a drink. felt very well here with my friend. unfortunately my caesar salad was absolutely disappointing, made without any touch of effort. some leaves of salad, few eggs and fried chicken. no capers, no anchovyâs and sauce without any taste.."
"arrived at 2pm waiting for 20min and asked 6 times to place my order. after i went to the bar for a 2nd time, someone found the decency to follow me to our table to take the order. 30mins passed in the meantime. another 30mins until the food came out. food was extremely disappointing and wonder why two slices of bread with salmon and the other with tuna takes 30min? the visit ended with waiting for 20min for the bill. in the meantime people around us left without paying. staff though was very friendly. i felt sorry for them. they were doing their best but they obviously have a manager who has no clue how to manage and plan for a busy summer day. i will not go again..."
"ive bough a ticket for an event at this venue. arriving at the location, the customers are confronted with a mandatory toilet charge already at the door. if you refuse to pay, they will not let you in and the money that you have paid for the event will be forfeit. never again. i am surprised people never wrote about this here."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
"attracted by the nice location we had diner. the idea, as the waiter explained, is kind of a table dhote concept with changing menus every week. the food was ok, unfortunately the service quit poor. loads of dirty glasses and dishes remained on table, water was hard to find and orders were mixed up ( there were only 4 tables to be served "
"a lovely location and a great building - an old youth hostel - has a good menu. however, the experience was tarnished by poor service; delays and wrong orders."
"we often stop here to have a drink or so. volenteers serving, many playing and shouting kids, not much choice but ok for a soup or a drink. sit if the sun is out end enjoy. but not too long, beautiful nature around the corner (if not to many bikers and runners). relax!"
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosÃ© disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didnât have to fill in our details) they didnât clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and itâs sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here ð
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the satÃ© meat was very d 
they advertise fresh farm fries. these are great and a real reason to come back as a regular. when its sunny thus busy they revert back to greasy factory fries which are not even cri 
location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
been there a few times and ordered something else every time. but sadly every dish was disappointing. it wasnt bad but it always had flaws. the location is cool. the personel is okay. sometimes they just close parts of the terrace wich is weird because itâs not nice to sit on every spot. they use way too much sauce imo.
we went there with a group od 16 people. the place was overheated and the service mediocre the food was less than mediocre.
my girlfriend and i went there for a small dinner just a sandwich or a starter we arrived at 17:00. we could only have small bites instead of something decent. crazy we had to wait for half an hour to order some decent food. we could also not have something of the lunch menu. besides it was expensive and service was poor. 
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. donât go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and itâs just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and itâs close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"great italian food. great italian atmosphere. great value for money. was very busy, but we could sit at the last unreserved table. food and drinks italian style. fast service, fast food and good prices."
"went here expecting to have a good dining experience, unfortunately the service was disappointing. the waiters were friendly and helpful, however we got the impression they couldnt cope with all the guest they were serving. we ordered some bread which they forgot and brought after our main dish had arrived, then i ordered some wine and they brought us water. regarding the quality of the food, i wasnt really impressed about it, the meat i ordered was very dry and there was an excess of sauce. definitively in my opinion this place is not worth the visit."
"on our holidaytrip, we stopped at la trattoria in castricum. sitting on a terrace, we had a nice dinner. the food was good, the service fine and the price was fair."
"we visited deining twice. last year, from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return her "
"lunch with some colleagues to discuss things in a nice location rather than a meeting room. we had a coffee outside and sandwiches inside. all good, service was friendly and efficient."
a really nice place as well as in good weather as in hard north sea conditions. beautyful fireplace and friendly service. the main dishes are not as nice as the rest and the pasta was more or less not eatable. just donât try it
"from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return here. "
"we traveled from amsterdam to castricum to visit an old friend. we stopped here for lunch after walking on the beach. we sat inside as the sun was very strong. server was not very friendly but we got our drinks and food. we had salads and they were very good. when we had asked for still water and he was quite put off about it. otherwise a good meal, not busy during the week."
we went here on a great indian summer evening for din 
"went to the beach at castricum-at-sea, had a drink and a bite at deining. average food, friendly personnel. crowded and noisy, but hey, thats what you get at an beach inn."
"been there several times, always enjoying sitting outside. beware of the wind but nice place anyway and at least as good, maybe better than surroundings. but no really oustanding things to mention."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we came here for a quick lunch and we thought â¬12 for our meatball sandwich which wasnât that tasty or special was quite expensive. the place is nice and the location is special.
"my wife and i ordered the catch of the day this was sea bass. this was two, uneven, filets of sea bass on spagetti with tomato sauce and raw bean sprouts. a fusion dish both bewildering and, frankly, disgusting. i think they should have warned us that this was a spaghetti dish. the fish was tasteless, so i gathered the tomato sauce was there to conceal this! we also ordered a side dish of roasted potatoes and salad. the salad was uninspiring and the potatoes were raw. the cost of the meal was around 70 euros and they offered a 10 euro discount. this did not take away the bad taste in our mouths!"
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the dÃ©cor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"cons: far from everything, somehow depressive. even far from everything, there is no mini bar or small refrigerator at room so you can buy something to the room. almost 0 facilities, no gym, no pool, really nothing, not even water at room. breakfast is poor and getting worst, they are reducing options even in bread. furniture and ambiance is dark. at the entrance smoker people has a comfortable sit so they pollute entering people with bad sme "
"we come to this place once in a while and must say that food quality varies: we had multiple ocassions that food was not really warm, the fries bag not fully filled or invalid orders. but if you mention it, they will quickly resolved the probl "
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
"we had a nice evening chatting, eating and drinking. however apart from the kroketten nothing outstanding, actually all the meat not cooked very well (nobody asked how we wanted it), or maybe not the best quality, and all rice served in paella etc very porridge like and overcooked, little fresh vegetables. servers all very nice, kitcen a bit sloppy as we asked for no curry sauces and still got it.... drinks quite pricy not to say expensive for such a place. even served water only by the bottle and paid (tap water would have been fine. all over spent nearly 30 euros pp on food and 10 euros on drinks which is not a little for such a place. nevertheless had a nice evening and reservations and table fine."
"with tapas i would have expected spanish food, but its a fusion of dutch, asian and italian foid in small portions. some are great, some are mediocre. environment is nice and service is quick."
"the all you can eat menu includes a lot of dishes which are all average. nothing is really good, and all the tastes used are familiar. this made it unappealing, especially when comparing the food quality with the prices. some of the staff were friendly, some not. the decoration of the restaurant is nice but the details are not (e.g. usage of a cheap bench). for this location and price, we expected way better food."
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
if you like dutch fried and deep fried snacks this is the place. but many times they got your order wrong and long waiting times. staff is not always that friendly but we keep coming back to this place.
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
"weve been to the flaming feather toverland, on october 23rd 20 "
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand cafÃ© with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
"the staff is really family oriented, efficient and very friendly. food is ok. good to reserve before going."
"for my mother in lawâs birthday, we went to porto maurizio in heythuysen. we arrived at 18:15 and got our starter around 18:45. the three of us ordered pizza (not too difficult to prepare), but it took the chefs more than one hour and 25 minutes to get out pizzaâs out on our table. the pizza tasted okay, but iâve had better at porto maurizioâs. if you ask me now, iâm in doubt if i will come and eat here again."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
"this restaurant is located at the base of the wilhelminatoren, so location is perfect if youre visiting the area. its a big restaurant with a nice terrace. the menu is typical dutch and so was the food. we ordered a salad, a croque and a stew. all were ok but not special. same for the local beer. good for lunch, but wouldnt have dinner here."
"although, in netherlands under this corona crisis, you are allowed 4 people per table and tables only had 3 chairs, we were barked at but a very rude waiter, screaming at us that things are different than in belgium... making clear his disrespect for people outside of holland! i have no issue with directions being given in this crisis, but the way we were barked at, explicitly outlining being belgian is rude, disrespectful and deserves a strong review on this for "
"for the last day of may we decided to go to the 3 country area in the south of the netherlands. this is in vaals, limburg. the navigation system guided us through the city over the four borders street towards the first stop; wilhelmina tower. the tower was built in 2011. enterance costs 3 euro per person, small children are free. you buy a token to get there in the restaurant beneath the tower. here i had a scary experience as when i wanted to pay by pin i thought i had to enter the pin code but instead the device asked for the amount to add as gratitude. luckily it did not accept my pin code as gratitude; too much it said... but why? why asking for gratitude when buying enterance token "
itâs a beautifull restaurant at a top location. the coffee is tasty but canât say the same about the food. especially the spare ribs were dreadfull. so if youâre just visiting to have a drink itâs ok but donât have dinner there.
the estate is amazing! great view but the food could be better. i had shrimps on the rock (16â¬) and wasnt satisfied with what i got. shrimps were minuscule and one could tell theyve been in the freezer before. not worth at al 
1. the theme is good but a bit over the top. way too many pictures. 2. music is not matching the theme. 3. too many flies. 4. dishes taste ok but not looking good.
this restaurant is clean and food is reasonable and price is very good.  the inside is like eating in a church on church pughs.  nice atmosphere and unusual location.  overall good.
"the restaurant located in an old missionary serves a small menu with easy going meals and easy going service. very cheap and in accordance with the meal. not too fancy, but good to go. we had the local special zuur vlees which was alright. the restaurant closes at 8 pm!!! so be in time."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
"horrible waiter , she took her time serving us and even just giving us a menu , we ordered a starter and a main course and she brought it together?? why even add a starter if u bring it together its called a starter for a reason. when we called her over she even eyerolled at us ð¬the pasta didnt have any cream and was filled with oil.. the burger was dry and bland and even the bread we ordered was bad i struggled to finish it just so i wouldnt feel like i wasted my money, worst experience ive had in vaals. i wouldnt recommend this restaura "
"a nice place to sit on the terrace, but the only table free was in the corner, so it was not practical to eat from when the main dish arrived, due to lack of space and being difficult to serve the hot dishes. hence we changed tables. took a menu, the steak was not very good, but the rest was decent. we wanted to try apfulstrudel for desert, as i saw this on the menu. but they said they had nothing but ice-cream. the desert was very simple unfortunately. i wouldnt recommend this restaurant."
"you can expect simple, but well prepared food. the prices are very agreeable. staff is very polite. the only point of attention are the flies outside on the patio."
"perfect place for a nice lunch, the staff take there time and are friendly. we enjoyed our soups of a chilly winters day. even though you sit on the heated veranda we chose to sit inside in the cafe."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the âreibekuchenâ were great. the âzuurvleesâ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
"i am handicapped and asked for a table were i am more or less protected. but this they did not have, it was busy, understandable. on my question: â if you make reservation is it than possible to have a table out of the busy part of the restaurant. the answer was no, we have no attention for this, it is better if you go to a less busy restaurant. i was flabbergasted, but thought okÃ©. good food here, but if handicapped you are not welcome here. we went to the village of vijlen where we ate in cuba libre, which was a good experience. "
"the food was terrible, heaten up in a microwave. i never have eaten such a tastless mousaka in my life. watery and the calamaris was rubbery. cheap squidrings would be better then this. only the dry white wine was good. it was packed and bums on seats policy. never go again to this  greek restaurant."
"great greek food, but very noisy and crowded with little children running and screaming. cant eat your dish calmly"
i was looking forward to a nice date evening with my husband but i didnt like the restauran 
..i suggest to avoid this place and try somethingelse in the vicinity. the food is low quality and we didnt like the service also. i will not came back for sure!
"heading for the 3landepunt and we stopped for breakfast! all is prefabricated and pretty tasteless, even if quantity is large! nice decoration on the wall as it represents old news papers about the place and history about the borders! the waitress was helpful! however i would not eat here again! "
"the food is good, nice setting but slow service, good beer.  sorry but i would not go back..i was not impressed."
this is not the drielandenpunt ... its another km onwards. tower has no arrows or anything pointing out landmarks. drinks were expensive.
"the food is absolutely terrible. pasta was supposed to be fresh but was not fresh at all, pesto out of a jar, sour salad on the side, tuna sandwich with terrible tuna out of plastic box,â¦ and pricy! way too expensive for food that is not at all fresh! 16,5 euro for âfreshâ pasta? 10 euro for a piece of bread with tuna spread?! we were with 7 persons and everybody left a plate with half eaten food. what a sad end of our family weekendâ¦"
restaurant close to the 3 country point with a great view from the terrace. we ordered salads and fried eggs for lunch; average quality against a fair price and friendly service.
"we came to this restaurant for lunch on a rainy afternoon. there is plenty of covered, as well as uncovered terrace, but we chose to sit comfortably indoors. the service was very pleasant. the menu, though not large, offered enough lunch items. they have no salads, which is unusual. we all ordered a dutch pancake, and were unfortunately very disappointed. clearly neither the apple nor the cheese pancake was made on the spot. they were tough, even hard to cut. most probably they had been rewarmed in a microwave. what a disappointment, nine euros for a tough pancake. "
"for me it was clear that this restaurant depend on tourists and not people that return. it was a close call to giving only 2stars but the trout made the difference. being a fan of liver (especially with bacon and onions) the dish that was served was poor. liver was a bit chewy and a dish like this should not be served with strips of bacon. the waffle for desert was just ok, but they clearly used cheap cream and chocolate sauce. "
"this is a good stop when visiting the drielandenpunt. the view over aachen is very nice. its a relaxed place with friendly young staff and a playground for kids. good coffee. i was less enthusiastic about the food. pancakes were quite thick and tasted a bit stale, like they had been under a heating lamp for a while. "
"the uitsmijter is good, but the service is not that good. even with an almost empty place it took a while until we were able to pay. something that seems weird to me.  the view is great by the way!"
"nice location, nice panorama....structurally cozy environment but.....just for a coffee...or breakfast at maximum ....not advised for lunch....the menu is fully structured on pre cooked and artificial food .....have a beer....dont waste money in it"
"we were here with some friends to have lunch. i tried the schnitzel, which didnt please me. the meat tasted plane, there was some ham and cheese thrown on top and that was it. the fries were nice though, freshly cut in big pieces and crisply fried. there are better places for schnitzel around here, but my friends thought the salad there was good."
"nice location, nice decoration, with a wonderfull playing corner for kids. good service also. food is ok, but average price vs quality ratio. overall it worth a visit or two, specially with kids."
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
considering it is litterally attached to albert hein we didnt get the feeling of being near a supermarket. however if we had sat the near the large window / entrance it might have been differe 
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"we looked forward to our lunch here. very nice ambiance, great decoration of flowers, and cozy atmosphere. we all like a âlongâ lunch but we got here at 12:30 and left at 16:00. not because we were having such a good time, or great food, or lots to dink but due to poor service. it is the worst service experience i have ever had globallyâ¦the staff âdisappearedâ for periods on end. wine glass empty and me dying of thirst. from the seating to the whole meal it seemed like the staff had a big fight among each other and were not with it. according my guests the maitreâd was not presentâ¦which could make the differen "
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
"we stayed more then 2 h at table with two children for a 3-course dining. the food was ok, but more selfmade would be appreciated. my (varkenshaasje) had cooked to long, it should be rosÃ© inside. overall it was tasty."
we liked the food but the wait between courses was longer than expected. portions and side dishes can improve. recommended if you are staying in the hotel or if you leave closeby
"dinner on both days that we stayed there. great recipes and cooking, but too many drawbacks to recomme "
"somehow not very organized. we made a reservation, but could not attract any waiter/ waitress to order a drink. the soup was overpriced (6 euro), and not special/fresh at all."
"nice atmosphere though tables are rather small. we had the venison menu. first course was carpaccio with i.a. qumquat, except that there was no qumquat. second course very tasty. dessert should have been tarte tatin, but proved to be a tasty bit of apfelstrudel. not bad, but should have been mentioned. wines selected with the courses were presented in an informal manner. in summary: not bad, could have been better."
"i come often to the hotel in avegoor (due to its location) and sometimes i dont want to drive out to eat so i go to their restaurant. each time i wonder what it will be like because the restaurant and hotel changes hands regularly and i have had, good, correct and disgusting meals. this time the experience was extremely disappointing. i was there with family and friends and their opinion wasn`t any more positive. across the room i heard a couple rave about the food saying to the waiter that they will be back and i thought to myself - am i so hard to please? or maybe do they know what fine dining is meant to taste like or what are they comparing this food to, macdonalds? the chips and sauces are not home made. otherwise the service was good and the location, especially on a beautiful day when you can sit outside, is great."
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. wonât be returning here soon."
mcdonalds nijkerk takes great efforts to enable the social distancing rules due to the corona crisis. despite busy times this went ok. the food was pretty bad though - for starters none of the big salads were available. the fries were way too salt. the big tasty burger was almost impossible to eat with sauces coming out on all sides.
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
its a bar / restaurant and has the foods you might expect. the quality is good and its a great place for a quick meal.
"combination of a pub and restaurant , but this is not a good combination at all: noisy , alcoholics on the bar. friendly personal , but terrible kitchen."
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didnât seem to care. wonât be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
"i did like the place its pretty cozy and nice atmosphere the host is a little slow but the coffee is good not to cluttered. the menu had little like breakfast dishes to choose from but i still liked it, i still would recommend to try it. what they do have is a great variety of pies and pastries. "
i really like the atmosphere and location but would probably not go back to eat. the waiters came across happy and approachable. although the prices of are quite affordable. we ordered vegetarian burgers. the hamburger bun was a bit sticky and the (vegetarian) burger a bit moist and black at the sides. the burger came with potato chips instead of fries (which we expected of âhamburger with chipsâ). no veggie 
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"we went to the water sport shop in the area of marina horst. and as we still need two hours driving to our destination, we decided to get some warm drink from mccafe that just a three minutes walk from the shop. we also used the restroom. the cappucino was quite good. quick service and clean restaurant."
"after a long ride from the north, we came along for a cool drink. finally i took sundae strawberry. its quick, good service and the staff is very friendly"
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"

the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost â¬12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than â¬1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for â¬12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
"we ordered a simple meal, sate menu with salad and fries. the chicken was just done, but still very white. the sate sauce was very thin and runny. the fries and salad were ok. the restaurant also feels old and run down. would not eat here again. "
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
for the prices they charge you would expect a lot mor 
"had dinner with friends at the pizza part of the restaurant. ingredients were not fresh, mostly out of a can. crust was good though. a lot of mistakes were made by the owner, who seemed overwhelmed on a not so busy night."
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual âfriesâ restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
"nice atmosphere, cozy and a bit fancy; nice waiter, but food was a bit expensive,  quite disappointing and not what we ordered (of course was more expensive)"
"if you need a bite in a hurry go there. not bad, not special, average pricing. friendly staff. close to a street with lots of people on bikes.  a rental shop for bikes is next door."
"there is a large terrace and a smaller inside part. decor is a lovely blue and there are lots of coffee specialities. service was good, pleasant place to take a break."
"well, we were recommended this restaurant by our hotel, so we took the 30 minute bike ride to the beach to try it o "
"this place is situated on the beach, so the scenery is ok. also the the decoration is fine. and there it stops. the food is not good, served not warm enough, the steak commes with cranberry and unions, but that combination needs more then just baking. the fish was very fat, probably baked in to much butter and served with north sea shrimps, which were not cleaned, maybe appropriate for gamba style shrimps but not for 15 little dutch buggers! considering the quality of the food and its overpriced. would not return here"
"we visited this restaurant on july 26th with two families - four adults and six children. after not being seated for approximately 15 minutes, we asked a waiter for assistance. he rudely responded that he was busy and would get to us later. after being seated, we ordered water and drinks. the same rude waiter gave us a hard time for ordering water because âthey dont make money on waterâ. after asking for a drink from four different waiters and being ignored in all cases, i complained. the same rude waiter proceeded to get into a verbal altercation with me in front of my famil "
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.

"the location is not special, the decoration is ok, there is enough and free parking in the surroundings. the service was terrible, the waiter asked (2/3 of the table customers) if we fancied something to drink without even handing the wine menu, to the other 1/3 nothing ever was asked for anything at all, 30 min after sitting there and waiting no waiter nor the management came to the table even though our faces clearly showed our discomfort. the menu seemed interesting, i guess we will never know....."
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
iâm at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
after almost 8 months the menu is still the same. bit boring now even though the interial is fantastic and so id the terras.
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "

"good middle class hotel. very often dance and party in the backroom-no problem for guests. romoms rather small and not to new, but all is there. showgrÃ¶ssen was leaking, seems nobodys problem. stayed one week-showergel, tissues and so on was never stockt up, pity. staff friendly, breakfeast nice. "
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast â¬12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars. "
visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!
"i went here to eat lunch with my family. the restaurant looks really nice and cozy. unfortunately it was very cold inside, i even sat with my coat on during lunch. they have a kind of fireplace, but it is just for show, since it doesnt heat up the plac "
"we have been visiting hillegom for years, and this relatively new restaurant is one of several owned by the same people. it is a retro design, modeled on a nearby art deco building, which is pleasant. most of the dining was in an upstairs balcony, looking down over the salon or bar area. only part of the upstairs was open, and a good thing too as there was only one server for the entire place and she was extremely bu "

"sitting at alternatief right now. fantastic place, very nice good, excellent furniture but such a bad service. the 17-y o girl see me sitting down on the terras but kerp busy with the dishes washer. 10 min later, no reactio "
"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
good traditional dutch food and atmosphere. is is a pub dutch style plus restaurant. drinks are excellent: good choice. food is good and big portions. you have to make a reservation in the weekends. thursday night specials are advised!
"we had a family dinner here. make sure to check if it is a busy bar evening - to avoid too many drunk people. the food was great, but i was uncomfortable with the crowd at the bar."
"having only a single vegetarian main course does not make you âvegetarian friendlyâ. and the curry itself was not very tasteful neither, especially when compared to real indian cuisine. please, make a bit more effort in offering several choices."
"we had heard good recommendations about the food but were very disappointed by the very unfriendly almost rude manager on duty... i understand corona is a stressful situation especially for restaurants, but no need to be rude to customers... because of this behavior we decided to eat somewhere else (see my review of fletcher hotel schoorl restaurant). sorry for this review... we might try it again post corona... but for now i wonât recommend this."
guess it was quiet here because of the off season timing. this place next to the beach would probably be packed at summer. quite costly but well prepared food. nice decorations and good variation on seating. cannot seat a big group together.
we were in the area & stopped in for lunch. we didnt have reservations so were asked to sit at the bar/counter. we ordered tomato soup & broccoli soup of the day along with some other simple items. we were surprised at how long it took to get our entrees. we all agreed that we have had better service & soups.
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.
friendly welcome and a nice location are the only two positive things i found about this plac 
- a limited choice menu-card.....1 for lunch & another for dinner. printed on paper and worn-o 
"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"deciding to have a quick drink and some food in blarcium, we decided to go to moeke spijkstra. havent been there for a while as the last time it was avera "
orderd mint tea followed by an uitsmijter and salmon club sandwich.  both were prepared simply and tasted good.  reasonably priced and service adequate.
"moeke spijkstra is an authentic local haunt, great for locals, and also for visitors. the ambiance is as traditional dutch as can be - dark brown interior, as vincent van gogh might have experienced it, and persian rugs on the table. it feels warm and cosy, and there is plenty to look at. dont be fooled though, the clientele, typically in their 30s and 40s, are mostly television and advertising industry crowd. not a very welcoming and open lot. the food varies. our mussels were of very high quality and well prepared. also the fries were tip top. "
this restaurant is located in the very centre of town and thats the nicest about it. the dishes are ok but could do with a major overhaul on both presentation and quality!
"nothing special, very overrated, you probably have to belong to the incrodw to apreciate it fully. average"
"a very known pub among the people of blaricum and surroundings. here you can find unknown and known people, young and old, boy and girl. its a nice cosy pub. the dutch often call such a pub a brown cafe. a small town pub. they serve also food and i like the especially the sate. its not a top restaurant but a pub where you also can eat. if you want to eat on a friday or saturday, make sure youre in time and make a reservation. it could be busy. "
"we visited this place twice just recently, and unfortunately on both occasions i was not impressed with the food. here are some examples: pieces of warm bread which we received before food - were actually half frozen. pumpkin soup - i couldnt taste the pumpkin, it was more like a cooked sour cream of an orange colour. french fries - rather tasteless. i only enjoued the burger, and garnalenkroketjes - but why so expensive?!"
"in my opinion i can only say the restaurant has gone completely downhill. we went for a dinner this evening there were only four couples in total the entire evening, so not exactly rushed off their fe "
"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didnât expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menÃ¹ in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, itâs so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "
"- friendly, correct waite "
"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."
having lived in this village we went back for lunch without reservati 
i visited this place more often in the past. had not been for a long time but went here with the team (20 of us) in octobe 
"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (â¬12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, donât even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
the fries taste good. you can make a healthy deal with yourself: first walk to the end of the wavebraker and afterwards you deserve a fat snack ;)
"the staff is unpleasant, the food very expensive, tasteless and too greasy... i would definitely not recommend this place, or just for a drink !"
"terrible service, we had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and the menu. the waiters were not paying any attention at all and were very slow."
i had lunch with my family here very recently. i think it is more attractive in the summer than the winter. the food was good and the service adequate. they must pride themselves in being dog friendly which is great - up to the point where some dogs take a disliking to one another and let all the others know it.
"terrible experience!! food was absolutely horrible! not cooked, appetizers came after the main course!! you need to call them like 2-3 times before they show up ( only 5 tables, with 4 service people)!!! and they have the nerve to charge, 4 stars restaurant prices!!!! they deserve minus 1 star!!!"
keep going until you find some other place!  it was expensive and really awfull! we were waiting 1 hour for the food and no credit card was accepted.
"this is your average beach bar. nice to sit and enjoy a drink in the sun. food is fine, but nothing out of the ordinary."
casual warm lunch offered by friendly staff. croquet and french fries and good selection of beer and wines.
"i liked the setting right on the beach, the weather was very nice and the food was fine. then came the bill and i did not initially notice it but when i looked closer they had charged me one euro for mayonaise that i had not even asked for. a very sneaky way to make some extra money and im sure most people do not even realise and just pay the bill. i pointed this out to the waiter who then became quite arrogant but did give me the one euro back. now this is not whether or not people can afford an extra euro or not, this is about the principle of charging people for something they did not order. not impressed and for that reason i will not be going there again."
"i had dinner here with my wife on a nice summer day. we sat outside which was nice. the food was good, but the service was somewhat slow. overall it was nice and i would give it a 7 out of 10."
"always when the sun is out the beach is crowed. the place is super cool, cosy and nice decorat "
"we had lunch here in august on a rainy day. we had a grilled cheese sandwich, prepared in a pan. nice, but to greasy for my taste. next to that we had ginger cheese pancakes which was delicious. friendly, quick service."

"the restaurant was recommended as âthe place to be â in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
one of many but a good place to sit. the staff is friendly and it is reasonably priced as well. not a bad place at all.
"i went here with a friend. i had a beer and a hamburger (for 17,75â¬). the patty was too thick but the circumference was too small. worse is that the flavor was quite bad: the meat was not tasty, the cheese was not tasty, the sauce was not good, the bun was a bit dr "

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"just after a long period of closing, because of corona, this restaurant started up. wher they usely serve a buffet, they now have plate service. the portions were very different: the sate was huge (almost for 2 persons), but the burger was tiny whitout any vegetables. my salmon was juicy en enough for 1 person."
"we enjoyed our simple italian meal in this very convenient restaurant for the return ferry to harwich. however, we were stunned to be charged 9 euros for a bottle of still water. the bill was first marked up as 7 euros and then changed to 9. when we queried it we were told water is expensive in holland. its not."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my satÃ© (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
a quick bite before the ferry sit outside in the sun and enjoy the atmosphere of this small town square. good service and good food.
we were early for our boat back to england and thought wed have a meal before getting on the boat. the homemade speciality burgers at over 12euros were awful & probably bought at the lidl next door. my salad was very average - with chicken straight out of a packet & slapped on the plate. being charged 50cents for a glass of tap water was really mean - even the best restaurants we visited in the netherlands have never done th

"bitterballen were nice. vlammetjes (springrolls) were too oily. chicken sate, the sauce was terrible. drinks were good and all the staff were friendly. just a place for a drink."
staff wasnât very nice and the food wasnât great either. i highly recommend you to visit another place to eat.
"quick, friendly service. the food was well to eat, not high quality, partly products from the freezer, like the firy grilled cheese sandwicg and the satay. the sfere was good."
"we ate here for an early breakfast - one of the few places available. wed eaten here before and had a lovely welcome and delicious food. on this occasion the welcome was fine (but less enthusiastic) and the food was poorer - so were were rather disappointed. most specifically those who ordered scrambled eggs were served chopped fried eggs on dry toast. service was reasonably fast. it is quite popular, filling up quite a lot whilst we were there. well probably eat here again, and give them another try"
"we had as usual a lovely time, took a while to get served our first drinks but after that it went ok. hubby had nice carpaccio, i ordered the calamari, was ok. but you would expect it to be fresh and not bought from the wholesaler. as i can buy it from the same place . but its a beach tent so except it. will come back, but order something else. "
"we were here last week when it was relatively quiet. sat outside in the terrace but it took 3 servers going back and forth before one finally took our drink orders. we found this to be very inefficient. went inside to order dinner and it took an hour for our meal to arrive. calamari was good, bread basket was nice, beach burger was ok, the mussel dish was disappointing. the mussels themselves was nice but the broth where it was cooked in was so sour, that you cant dip your bread in it nor eat the mussels that was swimming in it. complained to the server but just got a ill pass it to the chef response. no further reaction and no apologies received."
"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"iâve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didnât really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"we enjoyed lunch at this place while sitting on the town square. my husband had the fish salad, that was really excellent. my mom had the asparagus soup which unfortunately had ham/bacon in it and shes vegetarian. both kids had a smoothie and a tosti, all fine. i had the vegetarian sandwich with hummus, and vegetables and then they added cheddar cheese. that simply does not go together. the bread was good but the sandwich was not great."
with a group of friends we had lunch and it was okay food. a club sandwich with chicken means thick bread with very thin and few slices of chicken. the others had much better food so perhaps do not take club sandwi

"the restaurant is now named ons gheluk. we had a three course meal a la carte. the soups and carpaccio were nice. as main course we had codfish which was really good. for dessert we had a scroppino, cheese platter and chocolate soufflÃ©. all delicious. the restaurant itself was a bit crowded and noisy. we had a nice evening."
"its 6pm we stepped in and two employers were dining. we waited for 10 minutes for the menukaart. the cafe interior was pretty; however, the food were in small portion, not tasty and expensive."
"a quiet sunday evening with only four tables being sat at...you would think our food order would come on time! the waitress did apologize & our table was given more bread but service, on the whole, was halfhearted. the food was mediocre...my veggie strudel, a  chef specialty was literally two stalks of asparagus with goats cheese wrapped in pastry....not inspiring. another guest had pepper sauce where the peppercorns would have snapped a tooth! so, on the whole, not somewhere i would rush back to...as the title says ~ disappointing."
"bad food, dont go there. food was dated and frozen the service was nice bud got sick from the food."

"fletcher hotels offer a 29,50â¬ 3 course menu, with some classic courses like tomato soup, fish and chips, mixed grill, coffee with sweets. several guests were complaining about the meat: hard and dry like the proverbial old shoe. the fish also wasnt to the mark, a large thick crust on top of a messy conglomerate of hake. some of the desert seemed stale, leftover. the best part all in all was the simple soup. we regularly stay in fletcher hotels and often eat there. they dont offer top gourmet, but mostly we had no complaints. this was substandard."
"the hotel and the service was good, but the rooms some us 15 people got was small. nice staff and good food in the restaurant. the breakfast was okay too!"
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 â¬ for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
"we had a dinner in a pleasant environment. wine list is nice, and worth. starter was a steak tartare, which was prepared very well. this was followed by fowl for my partner, which was prepared very well, and fish roodbaars, which was not prepared well at all (still raw and fishy). so a bit of a pity. cheeses were ok but not remarkable. so overall not a bad choice, but not as good as some reviews make you believe."
popular restaurant food well prepared and good presentation had 3 course menu choice is quite limit 
"michelin 1 fork but its not worth ! nice atmosphere, friendly staff but food was very disappointing. thai chicken soup but there was no chicken in it. fish was not good. poor quality and a chef that cant cook."
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service ! "
we visited (couple) during the week for a late lunch - it was not extremely crowd 
"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"a more than enthusiastic waiter/owner will greet you at this in the middle of this old village establishment. small, maybe 40 seats restaurant with a small me "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"on a cold winterday, we had lunch here. a nice mustard-soup in a far too large bowl. good tasting, but just too much for lunch. we took it with a glass of white wine, verdejo, also good tasting, but not listed on the price list. remarkable. not poured at the table so that we could see the label, the background of the wine. then a price for a moderate wine that is over the top to our experience. we often make an outing to bergen, but we will never go to this place again, sorry to say."
"this place has a bit the style of an english pub; young and old people meeting for a drink, or a smoke outside (blankets and gas lamps). the food is reasonable for dutch standards, and not too expensive. a bit noisy if you want to talk..."
"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didnât get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you canât book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz 
food is ok service slow but worse thing is people bringing thier dogs in .animals eat outside when we asked to move was a major problem
"tasty pancakes and waffles.  however i do not recommend waffles with ice cream and fruits.   coffee was ok, but not the best ever ;)"
"heart warming for parents and exciting for kids - here you get reasonably priced, easy to sell to kids type of food - pizza, pancakes, lasagne! : "
"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"
"tried soup of the day, 2 schnitzel, french fries and apple compote at the restaurant. reasonable good. good and friendly service."
noisy and not so good service. the food was okay! maybe a little bit early in the season for the staff
"this is a large, popular place in a nice location, though very noisy. nice atmosphere otherwise though. service was unreasonably slow and rather confused. dishes are served with chips and salad but these are charged separately and need to be ordered. quite pricey when this is considered"
the place was packed when we arrived and although we had made a reservation for 20:00 we were made to wait for a further 15 minutes until our table became availabl 
large centrally located restaurant in bergen. the atmosphere is somewhat in distinctive and bland. probably your best option for lunch in bergen however.
"we made a reservation for 9 people and were well received. the service was ok, but when we asked if we could order extra vegetables (they only had onions, mushrooms and salad available) the waitress could not help us. turns out everything is pre-prepared and ordered, so they simply dont have separate vegetables to grill. this was a problem because some of us have allergies. the steaks were very well cooked and tasty, but finding out theyre cooked in blue band (margarine) instead of butter (like they say) was another disappointme "

"last saturday we had dinner at loetje in bergen. the weather was nice, so we requested for a table on the large outside terrace. there was some confusion and it took a while before the staff served us. we all ordered the famous steak, but when the plates came, one plate was missing. the waiter apologized and solved the problem as soon as possible. the steaks were nice, but not as great as we are used to at loetje. it is not yet the oiled machine like loetje aan t ij in the north of amsterdam, but it is still a young branch and they have time to improve."

decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
"went here with mr. husband and little one. server was kind and made jokes with the children. little shade on the outside dining area. food was overpriced for mediocre quality and upkeep of the property (roof has clearly visible defects on the restaurant sign, outside tables are quite old) had flammkuchen, average. i think they were topped off with mozzarella (shouldnât that be crÃ¨me fraiche?). fish of the day was a little undercooked. husband had nachos, got almost a whole bag of nachos on a plate with very little topping. asked for extra veggies for little one, got a small bowl of peas covered in dressing. not really fit for a 2yo. also saw them serving pancakes to a child on a hot plate resulting in bur "

"the service was nice, however nobody else except from us was in the restaurant. when asking whether the âschnitzelâ was fresh, the service lady went back to the kitchen to ask and answered that itâs pork when she returned. a deep fried piece was served, dry and definately not fresh. we received one portion of fries where me and my partner should have received our own portion per person as this is what we where paying for. 16 euro for a deep fried single piece of (not even) meat is a joke. weâve paid 40 euro for a portion of kibbeling and a schnitzel, a small coke and a glass of win "
"went here with mr. husband and little one. we were early, servers were still haring diner themselves in the dining area (donât like that "
"from the outside it was already unclear. is it a restaurant or a snackbar. from the menu i would say it is more a snackbar. so i had a bit of difficulty to find a nice lunch.. still a very friendly, easy accessible place to eat and the new owners were doing their best to give good service."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection. "
i found place itself somehow wear

"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
"this was a nice enough cafe, although a bit too much like a school cafeteria. the ice cream across the road was great."
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldnât really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happenedâ¦. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the insideâ¦ even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"i went there recently with family for what was meant to be a nice evening out however, i when i left i was not one bit happy or satisfied. i am not saying that this is a totally bad place. actually it is perfect if you want to go with children. it has a nice big play area for the children. the staff are very attentive and friendly. they talk with a smile and are polite. the menu is reasonable with a reasonable pric "
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.ð¶ it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."

"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"with the current owners, vluchthaven has changed from a luxury restaurant to a fairly simple brasserie in which you sit on second- or third-hand furniture. fish is the mainstay of the cuisine which otherwise has mediterranean traits.the food was lovely otherwise, and their white house wine quite good. on the thursday that we visited, the restaurant was pretty understaffed with only one waiter for some 20-25 clients, but his friendliness compensated our waiting time. prices, however, were quite high; we spent some 50-60 euros for a 3-course dinner."
"this is a nice restaurant, only you cant see that its closed between 17:00 and 18:0 "

"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."
"ordered a tosti (bread with grilled cheese), but received one with ham. small accident, no problem, but we dont eat pork. mentioned this to the waitress, but was called a liar. they wouldnt replace the order.   great location, terrible service, would not recommend visiting."
"the food isnât half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didnât eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth â¬15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now iâm sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks itâs ok to throw away â¬15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we donât waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely whatâs going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didnât understand you. and i firmly asked what she didnât understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i donât need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way iâm waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw â¬10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."

we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.
had a quick lunch here out on the terrace. salad was good and tasty with some fresh bread. service friendly enjoyable place to sit in the sun for lunch.
"everything is average. the coffee, the chocolate, the apple pie was a nice try. but overall in this ambiance and atmosphere is it really nice to be here. i think they have enough customers around so they dont have to perform at their highest leve "

"the food was good, the staff was on and off in their friendliness. we went here twice in august. on monday evening the staff was friendly and quick to help us. on tuesday afternoon, they never seemed to notice my husband. he was in a wheelchair and couldnt just walk to the bar to order a drink. afterwards we found out that they were just with the 2 of them for the whole terrace. that was clearly not enough for a hot day in the high season. a lot of people choose to sit themselves on the terrace after swimming in the pool. the swimming pool was fun, it was busy, but that was to be expected on a heatwave day.

"went in for a quick bite during lunch time. friendly face service, accomodating to vegetarian request. glass of fresh orange juice (delicious) and a sandwich-bun with mozzarella, tomato, pesto(tasty and filling). together 10 euros."
"was a little less than expected, for the price, it is ok. i had a starter that was good, scampi, the main dish was trout and this was also good. the down side was the frys were only warm, the salad was very standard and the vegetables were overcook "
wow i canât believe the service over there. we where with a group of 8 people. the food was cold!!! after we went to the club and they couldnât find or reservation. jose and one girl came with the bottleâs with a bad attitude .. after all bad service never never again!!!!!!!!!!! rude employeeâs

"ate here with friends during a cycling trip last weekend: the service is very good and the interior is great as well. the food looked amazing, but the taste was not really good: my fish soup was very salty and i presume my stomach cramps were due to this soup ;( my friends hamburger was also not very good, the price was around 10eur, but he received cheap chicken-nugget like patties on a bun. our other friend had no complaints with his hearty pancake."

monopoly? not used to public? not flexible enough to adapt to good weather? anyhow: more than 1 hour waiting for very regular food is really too much.  improve your communication skills please..... always the same when you place your order with electronic devices....
"my family has visited julianadorp almost every year since the early 70ies, and i myself have been there almost every summer for 25 years. as long as i can think, there used to be a really nice, cozy and somewhat retro restaurant at the strandslag de zandloper: the schip of tstrand, gaining its name from an old, stranded ship which had been converted into a restaurant some decades ago, later replaced with a more pragmatic, seamans style shack on wooden pol "
"actually i would have liked to give brammetje a good. but this is not an option. brammetje serves good, straightforward food. the ambiance is nice and the staff is very friendly and attentive. the food could have been more balanced in terms of calories; the menu was pretty heavy. but over all certainly a nice place to go if youre in a beach oriented place like julianadorp."
"we went there on a saturday night because we wanted to have a pleasant dinner. we had no problems getting a reservation. the ambiance was nice, the table setting was nice, the bathrooms were nice and clean â so thats a big pl "
the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasnât bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."
this place was not good at all. starter ( calamari) and kidsâ pasta were way too simple and nothing special abou 
"i ordere tom yum prawns. it arived in a bowl drenched in half a cup of oil with no chilli, coriander, lime, garlic or ginger in site. when i brought it under the attention of the owner she rudely informed me that this is their way of cooking tom yum. i did not eat it but was billed â¬13 for it. restauranteurs like this are tipping their customers off ....but at their own detriment. they might cash in on us once but times are tough and and ignorant attitude like this will count against them on the long ru "
"we were there on our 1st eve. the place was not particularly clean (sticky table & papers on the floor). the meat-burger was ok, but the fish-burger was a fried thin patty taken out of the freezer - or at least it looked and tasted like it. no, nothing fancy about this place."
"food quality was poor. rice with the pokÃ©bowl was served as one big sticky bal. after feedback to the kitchen no excuse, nor any compensation was offered."
went here for a saturday evening dinner. it is located near a holiday park and therefore lot of people from that park were dining there with children. as the (nicely looking) interior is made of lots of metal and other hard surfaces it is quite noisy. the interior itself is industrial style and very nice looki 
"the restaurant is part of a big holiday resort. place is clean and looks quite nice. staff is very friendly. food is ok, but could be better. the choice of dishes is interesting, also trying to serve asian dishes and other out of the box stuff might be a bridge too far."
"came to this store to try the pizza take away service as our dog was not allowed into the restaurant. friendly reception and ample parking. pizza however was a real let down. pizza dough tasted like cardboard and quickly heated, toppings were ok. if you enjoy pizza go elsewhere or buy a frozen one in the supermarket. poor value for money. do not recommend! "
"the food was quite okay. the hostess, nonna, is wonderfully charming. the reason for a terrible rating is that we asked for 2 simple glasses of water for our 2 thirsty boys and were presented for expensive bottled mineral water. the waitress forgot to mention they refuse to serve tapwater. that was her mistake. what angers me is the policy of refusal of tap water. bottled water is pollution for it is carried from afar whilst excellent dutch tap water isnt. and why? because centerparcs wants to squeeze you for every buck in your pocket and doesnt give anything about our childrens future environment. so please stop advertising how much action you take for being green. it is just another one of your custumor luring schemes."
terrible at best. we waited over an hour for food. carbonara was covered in spring onions... they made another for us but it was bland and gloopy. salmon pasta was the same sauce with smoked salmon on top. ive had far better microwave meals. lasagne was ok. the only saving grace was our waitress who was lovely and clearly embarrassed. we could hear all the tables around us complaining... pizza which you could barely cut through. extortionately priced for the quality.
"organizational skills are hardly up to par. antipasta was served ages before getting our first drinks. pizzas were ok, but the pasta was, besides only being able to opt for penne (which is highly unlikely as pasta for bolognaise), extremely boring and had too little salmon to even mention it a salmon sauce. tasteless and no pepper on the table to spice it up. dessert time was no more satisfying than the prior experiences: the dame blanche could hardly be called a db, the kids cocktail was simple an alcohol-free fizzy drink, the bourbon was served in a gin glass that couldnt fit the ice cube and the aperol was so watery that i am hydrated for the next coming days. wish we would have read the reviews beforehand. this cannot be called an italian restaurant if restaurant at all!"
"we had wait for 20 minutes before anyone came to even take our order and then they got out first order wrong. we took two kids 3-course, a lasagna and another main course and salad. the food was ok without being good. for the kids desert tiramisu there were ice crystals in the ice cream, so either was an old ice cream or not properly stored. all in all, average food and average service in a park where food options are limited"
"it took over an hour for 1 pizza and 2 daily simple pasta dishes to arrive. no apologies from the staff who seemed to prefer to stand and chat to each other rather than serve the customers. our waitress asked us 3 times if weâd ordered - the answer was yes every time and surely when you only have 2 tables to cover you can remember that youâd been and asked us twice before?!finally gave them an ultimatum that if our food didnât arrive in the next 5 mins we were leaving, it miraculously appeared. bolognaise was dreadful and the tagliatelle was very undercooked. will definitely not be returning during our stay and it has put us off the other restaurants at center parcs port zÃ©lande."
1 pizza + 1 pasta 4 cheeses took more than one hour to arrive and it was overcooked... nonna came to see us at the beginning but never came bac 
food took over an hour to arrive and when it did we had to eat separately as the meals arrived at different times. the order had also been taken incorrectly and we were given a kiddies tomatoe pasta instead of an adults bolognaise. the waiter refused to change the orde 
"the food was horrible and ridiculously overpriced  service was bad too, we waited for more than an hour for very basic dishes.a real disappointment"
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really donât understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
food was terribly overcookes and the selection was minimal. terribly below the standard of what you would expect if you spend almost 30 euros per adult.
we are here in the evening. the restaurant is just too expensive for what they serve on the buffet. it is not worth it.
"it looks like an amazing place with a wooden cosy house and a terrace above the sea next to the harbour, amazing food too. but then you find out that the owners are the most unpolite people you can find. we tried to order a beer and to enquire about the food but weve just been turned out by a guy yelling at us as soon as he discovered that we didnt understand what he was saying. the gesture was pretty clear though... very unpleasant and it ruins all the charm of the place."
"we visited bistro skal several times during a stay at the dutch coast. while the service was never particularly attentive and we ended up with half an avocado as a replacement for a falafel (!?), the service on the last day was one of the worst i have experienced. we dropped in for a late lunch at 3.30. there were seven of us, five adults and two children. the waitress was reluctant to give us a table as she needed it back at 5pm. anyway she agreed to take a quick order and we ordered drinks. when it came to ordering food, she flatly refused to serve a single portion of chips for one of the children. her argument was that she couldnât profitably run a restaurant if guest just ordered chips. when we pointed out that we were also ordering six further meals she seemed initially more flexible, but the shutters went down when it turned out that one of the adult diners wanted fish & chips. that meal was only available in child size and there was apparently no option to adjust to adult size. we decided to get a takeaway from the place next door and while we ate outside in the sun, the table we originally sat at was emptyâ¦ a shame as the ambience is very nice and it could be a great place to eat with children."
"food not too bad, but when we were not sure if we should order dessert or not, their reaction in dutch was not very polite - they just didnt realise we understood the lingo! too bad we did..."
"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to â¬10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend â¬50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste. "
"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5â¬ (the wine only cost 10â¬). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldnât go there again. "
"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
a nice place for a drink! but we received far from fresh seafood.. staff is friendly but the kitchen could be much better.
we pre-registered for lunch and had to wait over 30 minutes together with our 2.5 y/o to order our food because the chef was still on a walk with his dogs. after approx. 1h we got the meals. the price was too high for the average quality.
"we visited this place after exploring the region. the location is excellent, with a nice view of the surrounding polde "
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the place its self looks okay... but the staff behind the bar is terrible. they forget drinks a lot of times, promise to make them in 5 minutes and 15 minutes later you still dont have a drink... and when you go back they tell you they forget about it... again. and when they finally bring your drink its the wrong drink. if this would happen once i wouldnt mind... but this happend serval times. the bouncers are absolutely amazing and very helpful."
"we came here for dinner. it was ok. the service was friendly but very slow. i had the carpaccio burger and my husband had the xxl cheese burger. both burgers were ok. flavor was there but the sides fell short. the sides were fries and coleslaw they just seemed like an after thought. they arenât very small child friendly but it was one of the only options to eat at when we got here. there is no changing table so if you have a child in diapers you will have to change them on the floor. we were seated outside which you are allowed to smoke outside so we were seated by a bunch of smokers. we wanted to be inside but iâm not sure why that wasnât an option because we didnât want to be by smokers while we ate. itâs a good atmosphere if you are single, married, or have older kids. seemed a little expensive for what we got. i wouldnât come here agai "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
too bad these people serve fresh mint tea with lice twice in a row and debate that this is normal. giving us the feeling that we are very silly in our complaint.
"very poor service, long waitingtimes. enough people to serve but not easy to make contact with them. pasta truffel tasteless. icecoffee with no icecream allthough this was mentioned on the menu. they brought a new one. nice terrace."
"i got the mixed grill. the chicken and the shredded (shawarma) pork were good. i donât care for the large servings of fries that seem to accompany most of the local meals. i didnât care for the sides that came with my order. iâd pass on ordering the pork skewer again. no english menu available, but staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and accommodating to my nut allergy. "
"highly rated but when we were there it was very disappointing. waiting times were long and food was not of the highest quality. when this was mentioned to the waitress, she felt sorry for us but that was it..."
"service: to slow.  blond waitress: unfriendly, distant, shy.  waiters dont even look or ask if customers need anything."
"restaurant was full, even after people left new people came in to take their table ! good sign, righ "
"this spot isnt my favorite and ive visited at least three times. unfortunately, the first time was ok, and the remainder of times were not good...too greasy, meat was hard to eat and i smelled of grease/oil when i lef "
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin cafÃ©. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "

"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the satÃ©, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."
i have been here 2 times already. mostly very bus 
"called in for a quick lunch. food was good and service friendly. looks like the locals frequent, so that is recommendation in itself."
this restaurant is unusually located in a former train station building next to the disused railway line (now a cycle path) which operated between turnhout and tilburg. the restaurant has been nicely renovated and now has quite a modern interior with plenty of space and comfortable seati 
"the food was absolutely fabulous, but the staff are just rude and unfriendly; no idea how to be good hosts; its a shame as it takes away from the excellent food thats being served; will not be going back because of the staff"
"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit âtoo muchâ. pick one of the more âtraditionalâ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"this establishment survives by location alone. beautiful views but the food is awful, hygiene poor (bar area, kitchen viewed from bar area and toilet facilities) and attitude of servers verging on rude. go for a drink maybe but donât be ripped off by the price for rubbish food"
"we have often stopped here for a coffee or beer as the location is beautiful. the food menu is basic but if you are just looking for that then it is fine. what i was really surprised by was that the toilet facilities now cost 1 euro, even for guests of the cafe & then to add insult to injury there was no toilet paper & the area needed a good clean. this is totally unacceptable during the coronavirus crisis, everyone should have access to hand washing facilities...there wasnt even sanitising hand gel available at the entrance. this cafe did not fulfil the requirements set out by the dutch government for health at this time."
absolutely disappointing. beautiful location but poor quality food at a price for which you would expect high quality. clients need to pay for washing their hands which is unacceptable in the current situation of the corona virus. pass your way and pick up any other beach restaurant in renesse. 
"visited a gen ing last sunday when we took a break from mountain-biking. we just had some coffees and a tea and ice creams, nothing special to mention. tea and coffee were alright, we were served quickly and had a nice rest on the terra "
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
"the restaurant is located in and old farm. it has a very nice terrace overlooking the farmland. i found the decor a bit disappointing. there is a standard ceiling set and that gives some idea of a football canteen. we enjoyed a buffet with a group of people and the food was of very good quality. it was a good place for our group even, but i would not visit the place for a dinner for 2."
terrible food and it took 1.5h to get the burgers. location is ok but also the stuff is not able to do their job.  never ever a next visit.
we visited teetied on a cycling tour. it has a nice terrace at the waterfront. so we stopped to have some drinks and a small lunch. the lunch chart is a bit limited but the view and location is very nice. we had some tostis and some drinks en enjoyed our stay. perfect place for a short stop-over. i would not recommend this if you want to have a extended meal or lunch.
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"i made a reservation through airbnb worth â¬906 (1 to 30 of april), i received the booking confirmation and two days later (4 days before my flight) the host canceled the reservation. i sent a message begging him, for not to stay on the street sleeping and the host didnt want to know. and my refund money only after 15 days. beware of bookings on this place !!"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"stopped here for drinks. nice location on the river vecht  looking at the lunch dishes it seemed a bit overpriced, lots of bread. well guess you pay for the location as well, nigtevecht is a nice place"
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"service was a little slow, but staff was friendly. prices are decent and the food is of decent to good quality."
"arrived at 17:40, requested 2 for dinner. male manager looked at clock and said ok, we can try. while every other guest was on patio or at windows, we were the only pair put back in the dark, stuffy bar. when the server arrived with no menus, we stared at each other - we had to ask for menus. we put our order in quickly. as we ate, other orders came out with no issue. the kitchen was not closed. food was ok, not worth seating drama."
"grand cafe valerius sounds promising, but in the end we were not really pleased. service was very much depending on the waiter/waitress and the food just wasnt it. the asparagus with ham was much to salty as was the asparagus soup we had as an entree. and the main dish with risotto was to much we could bear: first cooked, then fried. our stomachs couldnt handle it and we didnt eat or drink for the rest of the eveni "
we were there on 2 consecutive nights & on both occasions it took 90 mins for our main courses to arrive. took the enjoyment out of what would otherwise have been good experiences.
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but wonât eat there again!
"kwalitaria is a chain of fast food restaurants (core business deep fried food and burgers); the kwalitaria schiedam is located in the almost one kilometer long shopping street mgr. nolenslaan. the restaurant is almost at the eastern end of the street. i have mixed feelings about this fast food restaurant. free parking in the street, a quick order at the counter, indoor and outdoor seating area and free wi-fi should attract customers. the food is what you can expect from a fast food restaurant so i got what i wished for, but maybe due to the layout of the restaurant, i didnt feel completely relaxed while eating my fries and salmon burger. however, as this is personal, dont let you stop this from visiting the kwalitaria schiedam."
it was quiet when we went here. staff was friendly and the food was tasty and nice. splitting the bill at the register was not a problem.
my burger was supposed to be a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg . i asked no bread to reduce the mount of carbs since i would be having the fries. no problem they sa 
"the person that took our order was very polite and helpful. we got our starters which was âokayâ but shortly after that our main dish was served while i was having my starter. which, most definitely, is not the right approach. the burger itself was twice as small as the bread, abnormal."
very bad service!!! everytime we had to wave for some service. waitress is only talking with fellow worker

"i went there recently and ordered a vegetarian dish because i am vegetarian for 10 years. they brought me a pasta that i was supposed should have bbq vegi chicken, i started to eat and i feel this vegi chicken is very similar to real one, tola my friend their product is as similar as real chicken but ask my friend to test it and she told no i think it is the real chicken, i was shocked , the worst answer that i expected,i asked the staff to check my dish and he told sorry we made a mistake!? just sorry ?!and the funny and awful response of them offering me a coupon for a dessert??!! what they think?! i was in a bad mood mentally and physically but i think the first option should change my food and make new one but when i rejected the dessert offer ,they just put 14 euro on my table and collect the food of my friend also , she was between of her dish, it seems they just want us to leave the restaurant and donât say anything about they fault! it is so unprofessional and offensive behavior of their staff! i donât want to go there anymore and tell to all of my friends to donât go there. i donât suggest there at all!!!"
"tried happy italy in schiedam. and wow, horrendous. i ordered a pasta carbonara and a pizza with chicken, paprika and red onion. the chicken on the pizza was of the lowest possible quality and had no taste at all. i wouldnât recommend this restaurant to anyone."

1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"lunchroom soof offers coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, cake, breakfast and hot and cold lunches. what shall i say about soof. they have tried to make an as pleasing ambiance as is possible in a building, that was designed as a shop in the 60s of last century with a good deal of success. service of the waitress is prompt and friendly, the coffee is excellent and the cake delicious. cleanliness is ok, if you disregard the cobwebs in the bathroom area, so why the three point rating. the reason is, that i studied the menu and was amazed about the high prices of the food and drinks in this, lets face it, simple lunch room. even the bill for the cappuccino and cake was already rather eye watering, despite the good quality of the servings. "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"nice atmosphere, friendly service. let down by food quality. the meat dish was mostly good but the vegetarian was poor. undercooked corn tortillas, with processed nacho cheese sauce with what tasted like tinned salsa, with a few tortilla chips from a packet thrown on top..pretty poor effort for the only veg dish on the menu. veggies like nice food too, please try harder."
"was looking for a lunch, light meal. ater 17:00 only dinner menu was available. i choosed chefs choise, a steak. well made, but not more than a ordinary. got a good recomondation on be "
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
very central location. friendly staff. good food. interior lay-out is a bit different. some tlc could be added to the building.
visited here on numerous evenings with work colleagues. the staff were very accommodating and kept the drinks and bar snacks topped up and flowi 
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"we visited this place for a birthday dinner. the location is good, near the water where you can have a good look on the ships passing by. free parking nearby. it was too cold to sit outside, so we went in and were pointed to a table by the friendly staff. inside looks a bit daft, but its part of the experience so to speak with stuffed bears everywhere. ;) some bread for starters, which was good and fresh. several house wines are served by the glass. i ordered the chicken sateh dish, which was simple but good. the fries were a bit cold, but this was solved quick and in a correct manner by the staff. reasonably priced."
this is a reasonable restaurant open late for something to eat and drink.
"they are in the center, and the people are friendly. good beers, sandwiches. nothing special, but very agreeable."
"nothing outstanding about the greek food here -- it was a tad greasy and disappointing. the serving size was large -- but frankly, id prefer smaller portions and better quality. the restaurant was noisy and busy, and the waitstaff were initially brusque but warmed up and became friendlier as the evening progressed."
this greek restaurant was a real disappointme

"lucys restaurant is situated in a hamlet off the main road groningen - emmen. on the menu are mainly english dishes, and thats what makes the difference from other restaurants in the neighbourhood. weve been here twice recently. the first time we came for a real english high tea, with sandwiches, scones and all the other sweat and heary things that belong to it. the only thing i missed was the traditional clotted cream. instead there was unsweatened whipped cream. the tea pot was refilled as soon as it was empty, with several kinds of good quality tea (leaves of course, not bags "
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they arenât attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasnât friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldnât answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help theyâd just say âi am the wrong person to askâ. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "
"i visited my hometown beek last month, and went to this restaurant three times. two times for lunch and once for dinner. it is definitely a hot spot for bikers and hikers. the restaurant has a very nice terrace with a beautiful view. the windmill next to the restaurant is a very nice attraction. there are tours to view the windmi "
"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paidâ¦..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"the cafÃ© has a very cosy atmosphere and is situated in the lovely village of de rijp. the service is friendly and ok. the food choice is limited though, good but not exceptional."
"good food, pleasant waitress but snobbish manager. too bad!! wont go back anymo "
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!ð¡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15â for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! donât waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "

"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. itâs definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "
we had not been to urk for many years and decided to revisit urk and enjoy a good fish dinner which should be easy considering that urk is a fishing to 
"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
"had a simple dinner at this greek restaurant which has good food for low prices. itâs really a old fashioned greek restaurant with nothing special but accurate service. they serve traditional greek food, lots of meat but tasteful. donât expect a classy place but somewhere where you can go with big groups. "
i had a lovely dinner with a friend in the olympi 
we had diner in this restaurant and we took the 3 courses surprise menu. even if everything was freshly cooked we didnât find it special. we took the wine pairing and it was a good match with the plates. but we were actually disappointed by the experience. 
"i visited with 3 business associates, we all took the 4 course surprise menu. presentation was ok-ish, nothing special. the taste was quite disappointing. starter base was poached salmon, accompanied by a.o. some wild mushrooms and razor clams, all pretty tasteless. fish course was sea bass which was good, but the accompanying bulgar cooked in saffran was overpowering for the fish. main couse was beef (2 ways) with ratatouille, beef was ok, ratatouille was excellent. madiera sauce was not great. dessert with a cherry base had some red wine vinegar accompaniment which in my opinion was too sharp and did not work. my collegues took the wine accompaniment which they said was good."
the restaurant its absolutely nice to sit its a bit loud inside but nevertheless its a cosy environment. serving is done at a very friendly level. you can say this is a reference for a lot of place 
"beautifull interiour, modern, food average, to noisy, stairs going up and down with people, service good but to busy and very little personal attention."
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the satÃ© and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didnât, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service youâd expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also Ã  la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays â¬3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."

"pleasent reception, clean rooms,uncomfertable bedding, adequate restaurant,  but seriously: no pasta? breakfast not included, good average."
"had a quick sunday afternoon drink with some family. to say that the service was poor was an understatement despite plenty of staff walking around. had to ask for drinks and for finger food, almost begging. drinks and food fine, service not"
"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay â¬ 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"fast food near the highway.  just a pitstop or a quick leg stretch.  inefficient staff, not very friendly.  food in line with other restaurants."
the veggie burger  was chicken!  and the fries were cold  very unsatisfying and disappointing the waste bins were full so we could not dispose of our food
"usually we came to mcdonalds only for the drink or ice but this time we took mc veggie, too. its not bad at all. service was oke though its a bit slower than normally mcd."
just wanted a mc muffin quick without bacon and a small coffee. ordered and there was enough staff standing there. it took them almost 15 min. really unbelievable. next to that the bread was dry and probably it was to long cooked.
"i went here twice for breakfast as we stayed in the hotel next door, but i must say that it wasnt really fast-food. i had to wait a minimum of 5 minutes for my breakfast order. quality was as expected and the service is the same everywhere."
"seemed to be the only show in town (italian restaurant closed and another one not serving food on saturday after 18.00 ??), never a good thing. long wait, mediocre food, mediocre service. wont rush back."
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."
"attempting to elevate from the level of chips shop, this restaurant leaves a confused impression. its neither this, nor th "
"this bistro is perfectly in an old building directly at the village center. nice terrace to sit outside, if the weather lets you with very attentive staff and good food. nice choice of beers and correct wines."
"average dining and drinking establishment. family friendly, reasonable prices. a bit too loud if you prefer a quieter atmosphere."
"this nice place looks at the beginning like and old english pub, in fact has a good selection of beers. food is also classic of a pub, but with some taste specialties. service is welcoming and quick. definitely worth of a stop if you are on the way."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; itâs just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
"to be perfectly honest, you always get a little lazy and sad after eating there, yet you always come back. its delicious, expensive, but afterward you regret your choice by default."
"the good news is that de beren eetcafÃ© is easily accessible, because the restaurant is situated on the n209 main thoroughfare, close to the bleiswijk ramp on the a12 motorway. furthermore, a spacious parking lot with free parking is part of the restaurant complex. more good news is, that a three course meal is obtainable for â¬ 19.99, value for money in a dutch restaurant. the restaurant is spacious, but the atmosphere is a bit like the burger king, if the burger king had put in a bar and went with the appointments for varnished wood. furthermore, too loud music was being played over the loudspeaker system. the bad news is, that the service and food left much to be desired. service of the staff was pleasant, but a bit bumbling and unpolished (not unique for a dutch restaurant) but broke down completely after the main course. we had to wait 20 minutes till the table was cleared and another 10 minutes till a member of the staff noticed our presence and took our order for dessert. in the mean time, members of the staff were flitting past our table, carrying plates with spare ribs (it was unlimited spare ribs evening). the same thing occurred after the bill was presented. it was impossible to attract the attention of the staff to bring the change. in the end i went to the cashiers desk and got the change there. keep in mind that the restaurant was not understaffed, but insufficient attention was payed to individual tables. about the food: after a promising start, carpaccio, (again augmented with spurious ingredients and salad leaves, but that is, unfortunately, the dutch way), the main course, tuna steak, (one of my favorites) was a disaster. the desert, chocolate nut cake, was of supermarket quality; a helping of vanilla ice cream along side the cake could not mask that impression. furthermore, my table companions complained to me about the substandard quality of the pork and that too much salt was used in the peanut sauce. the reason that i had selected de beren eetcafÃ© in bleiswijk was that i had visited a sister restaurant in schiedam a short while ago (see my review) and was impressed by the skilled cooking in a unpretentious atmosphere, but de beren eetcafÃ© in bleiswijk was a disappointment and we will keep to the schiedam branch in the future."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck  
"after visiting the branche cafÃ© in amersfoort which served perfect sandwiches, we decided to try this location as wel "
"double reservation in the system! today i was for the 3rd time and the last in this place. i payed online for the 1 hour bowling with my family with 3 kids and 10 minutes before we should start to play we got info from the desk that there was an error in the reservation system and offered to play in 2 hours. after decline od this offer i asked for a money back. the desk person refused it and said it is not per their policy. i insisted on it and finaly got my money back and saying i shall never return there. i feel tricked and dissapointed that this kind of things are happening even today. and appologies or travel compensation were not offered. sad and never again. i guess they kick us out as we had reservation only for the bowling, not in combination with the food. greedy. so if you make reservation and pay full price online, that does not mean you are going to play anyway..."
"nice big place, food is acceptable, better than average bowling place. the bowling is very professional. the sate was to small and the fish was to much, so not balanced, the meat was to seasoned with salt. medium rare was more rare. spinach was to salt."
"ballys is a nicely decorated place in the middle of the industrial estate plaspoelpolder. it is a great option for a corporate event like a farewell party. during our party the drinks were served quickly, but the second order of fried snacks (bittergarnituur) took a really long time to appear, maybe due to an overloaded kitchen."
"the bar is good: good beer, great service and an overall relaxed atmosphere - whats not to like? the food however is well... edible, really your usual pub grub like hamburger or salmon with a dutch twist. dont misunderstand me, you will not go away humgry just that the food is not memorable in any way."
i ordered fish and chips for lunch. you would expect the fish to look at least fish-like but what i received looked like a large fish finger.

"had a valentines dinner here in feb 2015; staff was very friendly, and even decorated the table for me and my wife! food was what you can expect from a tapas place, its tasty, but a bit of an overload in oil/garlic (which is perhaps part of the cuisine?) - but that kind of makes every dish taste very similar! all in all, would certainly come back again due to friendly staff, and the fact that oil and garlic are actually quite tasty. a bit more variety in taste wouldnt hurt though!"
"i went to try the tapas with my husband and since we must work until 8 pm, were a little late for the all you can eat.. but we dont mind to speed up because were so tired too. the bill came up 70 something euros! we ate only a few tapas and it wasnt even meet the standard of tapas on the street of barcelona or malaga.. so dissapointed we will never eat here again! you can never get a second chance for first impression.."
we had the all you can eat tapas option for â¬20 per person. that is s bit of an overstatement due to the rules and the kitchen slownes

"we went for a family birthday lunch on a sunday. we choose the restaurant because it offers an a la cart menu; because some of us donât like fish and would like to eat the vegetarian or meat options. arriving at the restaurant, we had to call twice before they would open the gates for the parking lot. this should have been a warning. one of the tables was unsteady, so we asked for a coaster to support the table. they promised to do it immediately, but instead were busy discussing the daily life. we asked again, and got a rather annoyed look from the staff but in the end did receive the coaster. when we received the menu, not all of us wanted the surprise 3/4 course menu or the regular 3/4 course menu. since the waiter didnât inform us that those two menus were the only options, we wanted to order a la cart options, but were informed in a rather condescening way that this was absolutely not possible. only when we said that most items on the menu for a certain member was not possible, did it become possible if the whole table would make the same order. although we did receive an apology for that choosing a la cart options was not possible, we thought the communication was bad. in the end we selected a couple of courses from the chefâs menu, and we also added wine for each course. we received the first two courses within 2,5 hours, and asked for a cheese plate prior to desert. it took 1,5 hours before we received the cheese plate; by the time we asked for the cheese plate again, it arrived within 10 minutes and the desert arrived 15 minutes later. we had the wine with all the food, except with the desert no wine was given. and when asked for it, it was too much effort to arrange it for us (even though they receive a fair amount of money for the wines if they had arranged it for us "
"we celebrated our weddings day there, ordered a surprise 4-course menu. unfortunately not surprised. the wine selection was good, the beefsteak was too raw and bitter, cheese too simple for a surprise. i do not recommend - a good service though."
"food is well prepared, good taste and textures, executed with great flair. really wish ingredients (beef) could have been better quality.  service is sketchy, from slow to patronizing."
"first, you are lucky if you found the restaurant at your first try. the location is difficult to find, even with gps, and the building reveals to you only at the last moment, when you start believing that youve got lo "
"we ordered the pasta with tomato and basil, and were served warm pasta with (canned tomato sauce). we asked where was the basil? and were told there was no basil, but were sent basil pesto! just terrible. not acceptable for these prices."
"where to go on a monday evening? we thought we would like to come back at savarin. it became a big disappointment. the new decoration made the restaurant very noisy, also before the big group entered. it is hard to handle such a group without spoiling the evening of the others, it became clear the staff couldnât. for half an hour no table was actually served in the whole restaurant. the staff appeared more instructed than trained, saying the right things on the wrong moment. also with good intentions it is hard to work in the wrong setti "
"as we live in old rijswijk we thought of giving this restaurant a try. the quality of the food was very good and the very young and rather inexperienced waiters did their best in a satisfactory way. our problem came with the dessert. there were two desserts of choice: one based on blueberry mousse and sorbet, and the other based on cheese panna cotta. we all ordered the panna cotta, but, t our surprise, we were all served with the blueberry mousse. we notified the waiter who obviously didnt know what to do, so he went back to check with his superior. when he returned to our table he started explaining us that the blueberry sorbet is in fact some kind of cheese panna cotta. as we didnt like to be taken for idiots, we asked for his superior. when his superior came, he had a very arrogant and patronising attitude and restated that the blueberry sorbet is in fact the panna cotta we ordered. he was very persitent and i had to confront him with the menu to make him admit that there was some confusion. this attitude is absolutely unacceptable from somebody working in services and who has the minimum respect for his customers and for his job! but apparently the guy doesnt have any notion about respect as he was trying to lie us up-front."
"chefs of restaurant savarin, part of les jeunes restaurateurs deurope, not only display culinary craftsmanship oriented on european gastronomy but also use organic ingredients. a special voucher action brought us to savarin, where they served us a three-course menu with veal as main course. the meat was tasty, it had a reasonable quantity and was complemented with only one asparagus, a little heap of sweet potatoes and a tablespoon of mushrooms. it seems that savarin only likes to fill up the restaurant, but refrains from attracting new customers with voucher deals. the price for this menu was too expensive for what was offered to us."
"visited restaurant savarin with our birthday party. from the moment we made our reservation we experienced the poor quality in service of the restaurant staff. a 3 course dinner is rather expensive at euro 49,50 and contains no special dishes, but the frustrating part of the evening was the coffee/tea. coffee was served without the sugar/milk tray for which we had to ask at the bar, but most of all the sweets were served after we had finished our coffee. btw. we did not order the friandises, but they were put on the table without asking. i mentioned that we were given the friandises after we had fisnished our coffee to the head waiter and he said he was sorry about this, but that was it. ( eur 7,50 for the cofee pp.) nothing to compensate his guests. this me made me feel a second rate gue "

"i usually only write reviews when i really liked a dinner, but this time i was so disappointed that i make an exception. we had thought about going to the savarin restaurant for some time, so when there was a special voucher action, we figured it was the right time to try. unfortunately, it is obvious that they are not trying to win new customers with their voucher deals, but just to fill up their restaurant. while the food was tasty, the menu was totally basic, so that in the end the price we paid with the rebate actually still felt overpriced. but ok, i understand that they cut a few corners there and you just dont get as good a deal as you had hoped. what really surprised me was the level of service. it starts with the fact that they put way too many tables in the restaurant, so that the servers have to squeeze between the tables. guests are constantly moving their chairs because the feel they have to make room for the passing servers. of the three servers we had only 1 was close to the standard i expect from a restaurant with a 50 euro menu. one forgot was on the plate when trying to explain the main course, the other never bothered to ask whether we liked the dinner when removing the plates. the waiter did not see when glasses were empty and it took ages to be able to order drinks. not just for us, but also at the surrounding tabl "

visited the restaurant and although the food and wine were nice t was way over priced. most wines were in the â¬30-45 price range and frankly they werent bad but i have had way better for wayyy cheaper. the food wasnt bad but 2 days after my visit i already have a hard time remembering what we had. more inspiration is needed to make this resto living up to its nam 
"this restaurant pretends to be upscale, but serves poor quality food. our group (15 people) had to wait more than an hour for the main course because as the staff explained they had a lot of guests to serve. which made me wonder what we were.... this place has to learn a lot about food, very poor quality and serving guests."
"i donât think iâll be back any time soon, the pistacho pesto pasta was bland and slightly uncooked; clearly prepared by someone who doesnât have a passion for food.. the pizza was ok: crunchy crust but slightly salty, nothing special. staff was kind but inexperienced."
"we visited with hubby and little one, when my mom visited from greece. we know italian food and were not delighted with what they served but neither disappointed. some of the plates were good and some were blah! waiter was very friendly. wine lovely. kids friendly too. not bad for an afternoon after shipping when you havent got any time to cook ;)"
the food is nothing special and quite honestly the pizza tastes like it was a frozen pizza and the pasta was bland. i wouldnt recommend this place at all.
"spent an evening here with colleagues. we were a group of 6, and arrived at around 19:00. service is friendly, and the atmosphere is nice. the speed of service however, isnt amazing. we received our starters around 21:00, and our main course around 21:30. one of our collegues unfortunately had to leave before his main course arrived, he hadnt expected to have to wait close to two hours for his fo "
"the atmosphere is nice and the service friendly. the food is average, at least what we had. we had a pizza (ive really tried better pizzas before), cannelloni (at least average), tuna filet (not bad) and a beef filet with pepper sauce (not bad)."
"under new management for about three years now, the restaurant now offers good italian food sicilian style (rather than northern italian, from where the former owner originated). pleasant atmosphere; nice view of the old rijswijk church from the window tables and terrace, the restaurant is currently also open for lunch. "
"upscale italian restaurant with italian owner who gives a lot of attention to his guests. fairly long wait times for the food, expect to spend the better part of an evening. good wines. the menu looks very interesting, but i have to say the taste of teh food was rather average, on the bland side. no real taste surprises.

"my parents were celebrating their 63rd wedding anniversary with my siblings at de wits on 28.08.2021. i could not come as i live in the uk. i called the restaurant, while they were having dinner, to order a bottle of champagne as a surprise for them, offering to pay by credit card. regrettably, the person answering the phone at de wits (i guess the owner/manager) said no, i cant do it as im too busy, and theyre all drinking fris (soft drinks) anyway. not only does he turn my business away, but he seems to feel entitled to decide what his guest should be drinking. some attitude, h "

"went here with a group of 15. had to place orders in advance. although last minute changes were made, staff remained friendly and helpful. food was good enough and was served in a timely manner. would go back next time when in rijswijk"
"a restaurant like many others, nice service and average cuisine. the fish of the main course was slightly smelly, the starter was ok. all in all not unforgettable!"
"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros â¢	nice terrace in busy street â¢	excellent wine is available â¢	service is good â¢	prices are realistic, not too high  conâs â¢	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"
the interior of this place is rather roomy and classy for a greek restaurant. it offers a wide range of menu items that seem more authentic than youd get at the average run-of-the-mill greek in your neighborho 
"the food is ok, but the place needs a facelift and the service is terrible. they forgot our drinks order several times! this place is not really recommendableâ¦"
"nice friendly eating cafe in rijswijk, also friendly for a drink in the evening. nice atmosphere and friendly."
this is a very local watering hole. has been there for over 30 years and a good place to have a drink and bitterballen. its nice enough but what is a shame is that to get inside you have to go through the front conservatory seating bit where there is a big cloud of cigarette smoke.
lady who was taking order by mcdrive was very rude. it happened 1 september around 17.10. this is the reason that we are not going to visit this place anymore.
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because itâs close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, iâve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but iâd rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so iâd like them better"
"we were a company of several people who had different dishes. the meat or fish was good, but the side dishes were boring. as everywhere else in the netherlands they only serve french fries and creamy sauces. very good service and friendly staff!"
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"
"theres little to redeem this place. set on the side of a shopping centre and over-looking the brutalist building of the local city hall, the food was equally uninspiring. its trying to lean up-market but should really stick to capturing the shoppers for coffee & cake or a lunch-time sandwich."
"we will never go back here. the menu looks very tempting, however when the food arrives nothing as it was said on the menu. never again!"
it used to be one of our favorite greek restaurants. a few weeks ago we went there with the whole fami 
quantity of gyros and tzaziki could be better. also feta was poor in the salad. menu is good as well as the red house wine.
"the food here was good and plenty. dinner comes with bits of potato and a salad. plenty of choice for everyone and kids menu available. service was ok as well, but what i suspect was the owner or manager was a bit dismissive."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than â¬ 6,00 per bottleâ¦.!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!
"food not cooked well, ingredients mentioned on the.menu not found! dirty cutlery, unfriendly service. gone before dessert was served to never coming back!"
"we picked this restaurant for a family dinner, based on previous experiences by some of our group who had eaten here as a coup "
"the food was good, the prices are decent, the staff can not handle the number of guests. you really ger a slow service."
this restaurant is in the middle of the centre located at the nice harbour but unfortunately you cannot view that out of the restaurant. the food is ok as is the atmosphere; if you make a reservation ask for a table downstairs as the few tables upstairs make you feel a bit lonley.

"we ordered take away dinner during covid lockdown. i read reviews before and wanted to try their spare ribs, which were good. but rest is simply horrible: veggies and fries are from cheap, deep frozen industrial ingredients. salmon appetizer- is simple a smoked salmon that you can find in any low quality supermarket and put on your plate. seriously if you do great meat dishes, why donât you invest in nice garnish? because it ruined all the experience (("

"i always order delivery for this bussiness. from all the orders throughout the year. i think there has only been one order that was delivered with all the add ons as i ordered. i thought after two months or so, i give it another try. i never posted a review.today was the last straw, the two pizzas i ordered one was correct. the second pizza was once again not the one i ordered, a conpletely different one. i contacted the company: i requested the correct pizza for free this time, maybe not to friendly. they did not agree to that since they have no registration of the previous incorrect orders, despite them once having given me a free order after an earlier debacle. might be because i order without an account. a dessert was offered, i refused that. now i got the correct order, however still with a spice i specified not to add. once you get the pizza the quality is good, but okay considering pricing. for me this was the straw that broke the camels back for the delivery option. i dont know if they give the wrong order to the delivery person or that it already goes wrong when reading the order.i am just one customer, but how unlucky can you get? i used to recommend this pizzeria to friends and family, but i will no longer do so."

"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"

"a place which really benefits from its location. a good 20minutes walk to anywhere else means you have few options. consequently, this place can inflate its prizes for what you get. good is good. but expensive."
"i really want to like olive because i like to support local restaurant but i just am not impressed. they canât seem to decide what type of restaurant they want to be. is it greek, italian or spanish? do i have a main course or do i have tapas from a small selection? the patio is nice and in the summer you have an amazing view. but after trying this place twice i donât plan on giving them a third chance. "
"even after eating here i am not sure whether the main focus of the place was italian or spanish or greek. for the most part, it ended up not offering the best from these countries. the selection of dishes to offer seemed slightly strange. four of us ate there and decided to have tapas/mezes only. some of the plates like the calamares and the patatas bravas were ok â it is hard to mess these up. the pumpkin balls were also good, however the greek salad was as far removed from a typical greek salad as the moon is from athens. it was dire. the house red wine â italian â was ok but pricey. the first bottle that we had was too warm. the outside decking area was ok but nothing special. the service was a bit inconsistent â some of the waiters were better than others. i do not remember seeing any female staff - strange. i am sure you will find better places to eat in vleuten"

"this is a wonderful place to take a break from a bike ride. the restaurant has an outdoor terrace with service adjacent to the main building. in the back, across a narrow lane and right on the water is a simple dock over the river angstel, with seating and self service - you place your order at a window and are called when it is ready for pick-up. no frills, but the views over the meadows cant be beat."
"this location (maarssen) did not answer the phone, twice. then tried to order online. in my basket each pizza is suddenly â¬1.50 more expensive than listed. then tried calling the paid number. it asked my zip code to then bluntly tell me there is no location near me (seriously?) and hung up on me. congratulations with the worst customer service experience we had in a long time. "
horrible experience. today march 15. no entrance. no hostess for reception. no drie gangen menu. horrible bad food. crap ambiance. i used to go to school there. the waitress had long hair and not up. she didnât speak dutch. ukrainian. the food was the worst i have ever seen. never again. construction everywhere. no one knew where the chef was. he wasnât there. the website looks fab. the experi nfe and the food was scam. the only good thing was the bandol rose. wine list is great. donât go there
i am very sorry but in my opinion this establishment is not worthy of the number one position of restaurants in maarssen.there were 5 family members on a saturday evening.the food is no better than average.my mixed grill was similar to what you get in any kebab joint.the starter took half an hour to appear and the main course another one and a quarter hours.i complained to three different members of staff.one even had the audacity to dispute the length of time between courses.she argued that it had only been 45 minutes which was acceptable!this was a lie.i was then told by yet another staff member that our 5 meals would be delivered in 4 minutes.they arrived 20 minutes later!!there were no apologies but they could see we were not happy so offered a free drink.this was little compensation for such incompetence and undiplomatic behaviour.needless to say we did not bother to order a desert.we could see that various other customers were also dissatisfied.there are numerous restaurants in maarssen and most are better than this one.i recommend that you give this one a miss and spend your money elsewhere.
"claim to be vegetarian friendly, but do only have meat main courses on the menu. old-fashioned, unnecessary, not customer friendly."
"this is a restaurant of 12 in a dozen. nice if you are in the neighborhood but not really worth the travel. we had a very niece evening but that ws primarily because of our the audience. the menu is very conservative, the selection of wines not very exciting. food was ok prepared but my steak was well done while i ordered medium. it is these little things that make it average. the price is very reasonable. so we had a good night but the restaurant was nothing special."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.

"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."
"i took my daughter, her husband and their two children, ages 8 and 6, to dekooi on saturday, april 22 before i returned to the u. "
"de koooi is beautifully situated, new and modern in an old looking building. perfect fit with the surroundings. quality of the presented menu is average, prices are well above the restaurants in the village/centre of spakenburg. either boost the quality or lowering prices should be done. at this moment the scenery is nice, but lunch/dinne"
"great food if you can spare the time. service is poor, waiting times are much too long. i could say that the food is wordt waiting, but it isnât we scrapped the restaurant of our list. itâs a restaurant voor a quick dinner, not for a evening filling programm."
"the atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy, however the food is very very poor. we ordered salmon and it was all covered by a sauce that killed the taste of the fish. at the bottom of the salmon there was some pasta overcooked and insipid (lack of salt in the water when cooked "
"we had lunch here in september and the service was terrible. we ordered two toasties and had to wait over thirty minutes. i had ordered a tuna melt and was very unhappy that it contained chilli, i struggle with chilli and it was not mentioned on the menu! would not return."
"in the netherlands this type of eating is normal. you can order almost anything that you can fry. like the kroket and frikadel... this establishment offers plates too and its not bad. so if you are in for a snackbar, this one is a good one"
"we had lunch on the terrace near the water, which was good. the staff was friendly and the service was fast. and of course we were excited to eat out again after lockdo "
"we had to wait so long for our food, it ruined the evening. waiting staff tried hard but obviously the kitchen/management could not cope. what a disappointment."
we arrived hungry and had to wait 15 minutes to get any attention in a restaurant with only 3 tables ful 
"we just had a quite drink here before visiting the castle. the place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. the staff is friendly but it is an understatement to say that the so-called espresso is really underwhelming. if you want a decent coffee, better to have it in the castle itself."
"right in front of the castle cannenburch in vaassen the location of this restaurant is amazing! the food is good, the staff is young and seems inexperienced."
"the place is great, the food is not (anymore). has there been a chefs change? we ordered chicken risotto and the vegetarian wellington. the risotto was undercooked and not fresh (warmed in microwave?). the vegetarian wellington was a lot of puff pastry with almost no filling. you literally had to search for it. i would seriously advise the owner to search for a new chef, as todays food scares of people."
"we had lunch at this restaurant, its kind of a fast food restaurant with its speciality, chicken, since 1957. we just got french fries and drink. by nice weather you can sit outside, there is a lot of space."
when you walk in the restaurant you get a nice atmosphere and get your own seati 
"in uk, we used to wait to be seated, here you walk and get served. at first the dutch lady who served me did not speak much english, and could not tell me the special, then tried to sell me something off the menu then got another waiter who was really good, gave me the run down, starters, soups, then mains half a chicken etc.plus help your self salary, not much to say. if you like harvester salary, then your be very disappointed he "
"awefull pizzas, tastes horrible.  better of going somewhere else. i can make a better pizza with a tomato and some cheese"
"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"restaurant smulwereld de poshoorn has evolved from a fast food restaurant to an establishment with a wider scope, by offering also a menu with chinese dishes. as de posthoorn is run for the last couple of years by a family from the far east, this is not surprising. ordering is at the counter; the food is brought to you at your table. the service is polite and genuine hospitable, the fries are prepared with fresh cooking oil and the prices are moderate. furthermore, outside seating is provided, so you can watch the life in voorhuizen go by while eating your burger or babi panggang. not a restaurant on the must do list, but a safe bet for a quick and inexpensive meal when in the neighborhood."
"smulwereld de posthoorn is good for a quick stop on the way the replenish your stomach. de posthoorn has many advantages over the big fast food chains: it is situated in the center of voorthuizen at the road parallel to the main road through voorthuizen with no parking restrictions, the restaurant has the traditional counter with the deep fryers for take-away, but there is a cosy corner with 4 tables with sit-down service. the food is of course the dutch kaleidoscope of deep fried food products, but the french fries with sauce, salad and kroket, frikandel, satay and more are served on real plates with real cutlery. far better than the big chains. the restaurant is quiet, no blaring music and when the weather is clement, there are outside tables to seat at, even improving the experience, eating and watching the traffic go by. unfortunately, voorthuizen is in the middle of the veluwe, popular with tourist on bicycle tours, so the outside tables tend to be snapped up quickly. no culinary feats are accomplished at de posthoorn, but it is ok within their limitations."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "
after visiting radio kootwijk we stopped at this cafetaria for something cool. the location is in the shopping centre of voorthuizen. its very nice sitting outside on the bench with a cup of ice in your hand
"the restaurant kwalitaria de daltons is a fast food restaurant in the center of voorthuizen. the restaurant is, together with a row of shops, situated along a medium sized parking lot. dont forget to put out the parking disc; parking is time controlled here. it was glorious weather, so we settled down on the outside terrace for a quick lunch. this terrace is a bit dingy and cramped, but it serves the purpose. service on the terrace is offered, but was spotty and aloof, so we ended up ordering the food and drink at the counter and we took the serving tray with our order to our table ourselves. the food, french fries with a vegetarian snack, was mediocre, even taken into account the reduced expectations you have of a fast food restaurant. prices were at the upper side of the expectations. kwalitaria de daltons will not be our first choice in the future when stopping in voorthuizen."
it took the waiter a long time to arrive at our table to take our ord 
"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
by far the worst mcdonalds ive ever been to. cold food. low working pace. rude employees. dont go!
"food was okay, location is good, service is very bad. first you are not allowed on terrace to have only a few drink, one have to eat here. after ordering some lunch and just after food arrived a larger group came to sit next to us but had too few space, couple of times they were told out loud by the waiter that our table was free very shortly so they could all sit normally. we were just eating our lunch and took our time of course. but when i paid the bill i was not even given time to stuck away my wallet, the table was cleaned while i was still sitting there getting my stuff together so rude it was. "
stopped in here for drinks while passing through town with a large group of three to four tables on the pat 
"we ordered two coffee for me and my wife and 1 smoozy for our kid, but all other people around us (that also came later) got their orders (same coffee and smoozy as well), we asked waiter a few times to bring the order faster as we really need to go soon. without real help, he just said that theyre busy. after waiting of 30 minutes (!!!! yes - half an hour for drinks) i came inside caffee to asked whether its ready or we can just cancel it as we dont have time anymore, but bartender jumped out of the bar and started scream on me like in front of my friend, another waiter and people: yes, were busy! in what country its not normal for you to wait such time for drinks?! dont talk to me like this! take your coffee, pay money and get out of here as soon as possible!. if he would not be so small and fancy guy a few times less than me im sure he would start a fight, but after he came too close to me he realized that he overestimated himsel "
"not so good food is below expectation, simpel , far from being named as restaurant  service was poor, i get it, it was busy day"
"terrible service, the food was not bad, but the service is the worst i have ever had.  it is a pity that the place has a very good location."
"ordered from the lunch card sardines, flammekuche bacon and one with salmon and a hamburger. the sardines were big and really nice. the flammekuche were really small and not enough for a lunch. the burger was ok. coffee was good. all in all it was a little pricey for what we order "
"at the spot where earlier an italian restaurant was located is now a dutch brasserie with nice weather find (not easy, because is populair)  a table near  the waterfront. great fun to watch sailors struggle. the food is considering the attractive price a deal good."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
"i ordered a simple chicken dish. and it was supposed to be delivered after 40 minutes. after 40 minutes, they changed it with another hour and so on. called to cancel, but no one understood english. never going to order from here again."
we were undercharged and tried to correct this.  they then overcharged us.  when we complained we were barred!!!
"ordered at beanthere a couple of weeks ago. our food was horrible, every piece of chicken in our meal turned out to be still pink on the inside. me and my friend got struck by food that wasnt cooked well, we both ended up with horrible stomachaches the same nig "
"beanthere has a nice selection of surinam dishes to eat in or take away. the place is rather dark and lacks atmosphere, but service is friendly, though not very fast. but the dishes are are freshly made and very good."
this place is another option for coffee lovers....their coffee variety are superb.....should try the coffee mocha is so tempting
the waiter had no manners at a 
"the meal was good but its too expensive for what it was. so simple yet so expansive. moroever, the water costs 6 euros ?!! what kind of water is that to be this pricey..."
"the food is very good. i wish they had more options.  the price is not a fair price. they dont take your order you have to walk to them once you want to order food.  friendly people, i just wish there was value for money."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   iâd have coffee again but iâd leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
this is just a very low key dining experience but the food was well prepared.  it overlooks the river which adds to the experience.
good location but lacking in food performence. the dutch like their fries and know how to cook them. but here served lukewarm&soggy. the fish was deep fried and the sate not well grilled. this can be done a lot better even in the dutch kitchen m. but again the location is nice and next time i will go for the cafetaria and take the white bun with kroket with mustard and enjoy it outside on one of the bench 
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20â¬ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. iâm not sure iâd bother going again. 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 â¬. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
"you can have a great party i guess, but it is an old brown bar, that is in need of some tlc. you can play biljart and you can sit down at a slotsmachine, and you can have some coffey and pie if you are visiting schoonhoven."
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.

"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garÃ§on served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.
"where should i start : slow and rude service, wrong orders, uncooked and cold food which is ridiculously overprice "

"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 â¬ had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50â¬ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40â¬."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!

we just ate a pancake/waffle on their quite nice terrace (full of noisy kids but i didnt mind that da 
"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
when we visit sluis we love to stop there for a crepe. good and fast service. they show beautiful plates with exotic fruits but the fruit is not always good ... too bad they do not have a terrace . which we prefer in the summer.. 
nice place with air conditionning but some areas should definitely be cleaned.   ice cream but no lactose-free once.

my family and i stopped here a couple of days ago for waffles.the waffles were good but nothing special. the waffles were 12 euros with fresh fruit and ice cream. the young male server that waited on us was rude and expressed his frustration with our inability to understand the menu which was in dutch and german.
i wanted a waffle with strawberries and my wife a small fruit salad. they brought a whole contraption of fruits... nothing special other than the presentation and they charged 12 euros a plate. on the menu wasnt even liste 
me and my family orderd a simple dish. we waited in total of a 90 minutes on our food. the food was good but service is terrible. also a (tip for the owner) hire more waiters from dutch origin. many couldnt understand us beaucause they didnt speak the local language.
terrible service sat there about 50 minutes after asking for a radler beer had to point to the drink i wanted on the menu as the person serving could not understand dutch or english waited and waited but no drink left after 50 minutes never again need more staff and ones who understand dutch or english
we went in for a quick lunch on what was possibly one of the busiest days of the year. it took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to serve my first bite! they didnt even put bread on the table to nibble on! food was so-so. nothing special. the waiters were very nice and doing what they could. i think the problem is in the bar and kitch 
"although the speed of service was not the best , the setting and decor was good and the outside terrace was excellent for a summer day.very child friendly. our meals were seafood (mosselen&sole) and were very tasty."
"we tried paling and mosselen. very good mussels, eel was a bit less: too soft. its a pity they dont contract an extra waiter, specially during nice summer days when terrace is full of waiting people..."
"this is a nicely located reataurant with a large dining area in the garden at the rear which we used and it was very pleasant. however, service was very slow even though the place wasnt very busy. my starter of prawns and mushrooms in garlic was excellent but we had problems with our steak mains. my wife will not eat meat which is even faintly pink so we asked for it to be medium to well done. when it arrived it was raw in the middle and dripping with blood so it was sent back. when it reappeared there was very little difference so, rather than labour the point, she just left it. im not a fussy as my wife but my own steak was too bloody for my liking, even after it, too, was sent back. we were then treated to a lecture by the rather condescending waiter on how steak should be cooked and what you should ask f "
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"we visited zeeuws vlaanderen for a weekend. were dutch and the zeeland province is our birthground. sluis is a transformed little city with no charm at all. its a an allover moneymaking area and this restaurant was an important part of pur dissappointment. we had an 2-scope icecream with a kind of spraycream and an espressocoffee for around 15 euro! the espresso was good... the icecream was not. in sluis you can get a parkingplace...youd have tompay the fee for an entire day ... even if you want to visit the supermarket. for us no problem, we domnot need to stay there, but imagening people being on holiday with the family... they dont say no , they wont spoil the day! they should say no.. because theyre ripped off and seated on that terrace i felt ashame to be a dutch national"
"we ordered the pancakes with tea for â¬4,50. unfortunately the pancakes are small and nothing special. one of them didnt seem to be baked properly either. wouldnt come back for dessert."
"a sign outside promoted paling in het groen for â¬23,5. inside the menu stated â¬24,5 "
we ordered a normal round of drinks at this restaurant and then asked for glasses of water as well at the same time. when four bottles of water arrived with our other drinks and we said we had wanted tap water we were then told we dont do tap water. this hadnt been told to us when we ordered. we then proceeded to wait 45min for toasted sandwiches one of which was burnt. an unfortunate experience. 
"last week-end we (2) went to this place for the second time. sunny day, lots of people outside, and inside. we were here already once and had a salade niÃ§oise which was really ok. we even recommended the place a couple of months ago to friends who did complain about the poor quality. we were surprised. but last sunday (07/04/2013) we understood hem. although the place is clean, we had poor food quality (i had asian spareribs where 1/3 were barely grilled and still pink inside.) my partners white wine had a cork taste and the waitress told us this was impossible because it came from a carton container ( we have a serious wine experience and know when there is a cork smell/taste). she was quite blunt. the scampi from my partner were small and without taste, too much cream that was too liquid. my rosÃ© wine was ok (at last). we decided to pay the bill and go. when going to the mens toilet i had the very awful experience to discover the toilet left full of excrements on the seat (yes i am not joking). i understand that its not he owners fault but when i did reported this to the waitress, i had a very grumpy answer instead of something like oh were sorry sir, well check this immediately and thank you for reporting it. never again!"
we went there based on the positive previous reviews but left disappointed. the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly but the food was just not good enough. the fish stew was overcooked and the pasta was dripping in oil.
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said â5 more minutesâ which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked goodâ¦"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant ð´ is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish ð soup ð², but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries ð are ok ð, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesnât really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesnât has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"
"we ended up indoors on a beautiful day as the wasps were everywhere!! this was a shame as itâs location is beautiful on the side of the river. one did still manage to find us indoors, but this was better than the dozens crawling in our drinks and over the tables outsi "
"i had a grill burger: the bread was as twice as big as the patty, nothing special (only some ketchup and one leaf of lettuce.. and thats it "
i was visiting the area of sluis and decided to have a small snack at the mill of the villa 
"we went here many times before but now they have started a new process for ordering and it is no longer very nice. you now need to take your table number and order at one of the two kiosks entering in your mobile so you can receive a sms when your drinks are ready. i appreciate the use of technology but for a nice restaurant, i wish they would have kept it traditiona "
"this restaurant looks nice from the outside (itâs an old windmill) and the interior is cozy, especially the part in the historical building. we were sitting for less than a minute when the waitress came to take our order (good points for speed you should think), because we even hadnât even had the time to open the menu. we may as well not have done that, because we had to wait for a long time for her to come back. when we finally could place our order, she indicated we can only have drinks in this part of the building, and had to move to the other side of the restaurant. when we did, we again waited for half an hour to place our order. the waiter was impolite and inattentive, the food and hot drinks were so-so and over-priced. you can find cheaper and better in sluis, the historical building is not a wild card to charge high prices for bad food and slow and impolite service, plus rigid rules about where what could be consumed."
"the place is pleasant, but the food is so so. the service is not so bad. it is only an option, if you meet the place and do not like to go far."
"its interesting to see the windmill, we went inside the shop next to the restaurant.  we made a decision to go to the restaurant because of the location, quite unique, modern interior in an old windmill"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"now the restaurant is called âle petit parisâ, worst experience ever. the fish was overcooked and the chicken from cesar salad was unchewable :-("
this restaurant came recommended to us by someone in the family who had visited it over a year before. im not sure if things have drastically changed or if we came on a very unlucky day but this was one of the most infuriating and disappointing meals weve had in a long ti 
"a very busy restaurant. but it ranks in the all form no function scale. the thai curry took 45 minutes. once delivered a few of the pieces of chicken were raw. no one asked about the obviously raw pieces carefully moved out of the center of the bowl. the bill for the raw chicken, one water and one wine was 28â¬. praying i donât also pay with illness later today. "
this restaurant offers a comfy cozy interior and quite friendly and swift servi 
"very nice restaurant, but unfortunately the food was average, was a bit bland if compared to other greek restaurants. the service was lacking, we werent even asked if we wanted dessert."
"not horrible if youâre not a greek food fan.  i really wanted greek and felt i got dutch trying to be greek. no authentic grape leaves for example. overall, just lacking atmosphere and authenticity."
"we regularly have lunch in this restaurant. many people here are regular guests. i took the oven baked fish with wine sauce, it excelled in being tasteless. my wife took the flemish stew and enjoyed it a lot. depending on what you take you will enjoy it more or less. the service is always very friendly."
"have visited this eatery previously & has always been ok. however, on a recent visit to sluis me & my husband decided to have lunch here, now they welcome people from uk but do not have an english menu which i find ignorant & not very keen to explain their menu. that said we selected a tuna baguette each & a beer & diet coke. as we donât speak dutch, we failed to notice a sur charge on all baguettes of 1.50 euros on top of the price of a standard roll. this took our total bill to 26 euros!!! really for 2 blooming rolls & 2 drinks iâm sorry this is a real rip off & we will never be going back. we did approach the waitress who conveniently said we should have asked: we did & she chose to not understand us. what a rip off!!! avoid as very expensive without sur charges for baguettes."
"we stayed at de lingehoeve for three nights and ate in the restaurant once. ive described it as interesting because it could be very good but lets itself down by things that you think might be easily rectified. for example: (1) our room had no discernible number and no key, so we couldnt lock our door from the outside. once we came back to find the door ajar! (2) they didnt serve breakfast on a monday morning before 9 am! (they did eventually agree to leave us a tray out, and the breakfast itself was good.) (3) there were coffee and tea-making facilities in the room but no coffee or tea! (4) on the sunday, although no one made up our room, they did leave us some clean towels (but left the dirty ones!). (5) the lounge has great antique furniture but none of it was polished, or even dusted. (6) the food, which was all a surprise(!), was well cooked and well presented, but both the tuna and duck were almost raw, which is not to everyones taste and sending back food is always disruptiv "
"bad service, bad info, burned bitterballen .... something so simple and not bring able to do that at a normal (basic) level of quality is reason to reconsider whether you should be open for business, accepting peopleâs money ..."
little atmosphere. nice view of water but its overlooked an industrial sized macdonalds and an ugly bridge. it is accessed via a road running alongside the river which is largely industrial and without char 
"went here for a simple lunch on a sunday. the service was terrible. we ordered snacks, and they came after 40 min. no warning that the wait was going to be long. no sorry for the delay. another 20 min to get cold wraps. the food was ok, but at that point, we just wanted to go. one more thing;the chicken wrap was way too spicy"
unfortunately the location and presentation of the place does not come anywhere near how they run the pla 
"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."
"we had some bites in the afternoon : they were ok and although we had to wait very long, we got a very good service from one pers "
"went here for a 5-course dinner on a saturday evening, we came in early and were welcomed very friendly. the table was nicely setup, clean and spacious setup of the tables and (i love it) an open kitchen. first we were asked if we wanted and appetizer drink (which we agreed on), we took a white port and a cocktail. port tasted good, sweet but not too sweet for a pre-dinner drink. cocktail was tasty also and not too alcoholic. we sat for a good 4 hours, starting with an appetizer (4 actually), bread+oil+butter&sea-salt and then all courses came. some we had to wait for other tables to catch up with us as they prepared most as they could at once. without going to details into the food it was in one word: fabulous. you get really good value for what you pay, for real. but there is a catch, several in fact, which will keep this restaurant from earning (or being eligible to earn) a real dutch michelin guide star. that being: the girls werent all dressed as it should, although they wore the same dress, one had white shoes under them, other black. also the restaurant is shared with the brasserie, and you see (as they share the kitchen) a lot of movement between the two which can be disturbing. also (even before the busy part) one of the girls left leaving essentially one girl (with sometimes help of second one) to serve all tables, resulting in the chef serving dinner for some courses). also the toilets (and paths to them) werent in match what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. not the cleanest, empty (supermarket style) soap and you could just walk out on the backside and into the (dishwasher part) of the kitchen. that area could use a re-style. but, as food is the most important thing in a restaurant, next to the service (which was, dont get me wrong, good) i do give this place a good review, also because the price really values the experience. so, for a great evening out i would highly recommend this place."
the last time we ate in the restaurant it was excellent and we were keen to go ba 
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
we went the day after the flower show to see the floats. it was awful. we had to force our way through the packed street which was like running a gauntlet of sales pitches and open air pubs. when we finally got to the floats they seemed like a tired afterthought and we had to queue to pay eight euros to see the 
"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
nice experience but maybe too many little dishes trying to impress ending up filling the guest too much. some of the dishes had very nice combinations (especially one with salmon and caviar) but i did not make it to the dessert or the cheeses which looked appealing precisely because of the too many amuse-bouche 
"went there a few times, location very nice, interior and setting average to poor! food is so, so, no feeling of genuine cooking more convenience cooking. although the staff is friendly the whole place is average."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."
"good burgers, good beers and finger food in a nice setting decorated with teddy bears. service is a little slow though."
"ive been here several times now, as it is close to work. if you need to get work done, their wifi is very fast and it not too bu "
"good food for a good price. nothing fancy or special but always a good place to have a meal with family or friends. the beeren restaurant in roosendaal is similar in quality to the other beren restaurants. although this one is a bit bigger than most ive visit, more spacious. staff is friendly."
a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"
"i visited the singraven estate with friends. we had a light lunch at this restaurant - pancakes. a very nice setting, with good quality food and reasonable prices."
the restaurant is very nice located in an ols water mill in a beautiful suurounding. the food is not bad but gives the idea that they did not change for at least twenty five years
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."
"i suppose its not easy to run this restaurant. if the weather is good, lots of people come to enjoy the nature and stop by the terras. you can never have enough people at hand to wait all the tabl "
excellent meat...no question about it....you can order it in any weight you might want and they show you the pieces almost like in a butchershop:what you see is indeed what you get 
"as described in several reviews here: this restaurant has been part of conspiracy-theories for years. they actively discourage vaccines, making the whole place unsanitary. there is a lot of propaganda to throw away face masks etc. i used to love to go here in the past, but its become a temple of doom."
"i made a reservation for my mother and a group of her friends for her 75th birthday. the event manager was aware that it was a special day and we specifically requested a table in the restaurant, not one of the separate rooms because they were too large and unsuitable (which the event manager agreed). literally 48 hours in advance, they cancelled the reservation because they had taken on a larger group (funeral). my mother was offered one of the separate rooms which we previously agreed upon were unsuitable for the occassion (too large and too business like). it seems a friendly, organic place, but in the end it is all about the money. do not be fooled."
"the first âcoolâ day in weeks, but just comfortable enough to start our dinner outside on the terrace of this very nice situated restaurant. the âspitskool kroketjesâ had little âspitskoolâ and a lot of ârouxâ in them and were not crunchy, but there was a nice salad on the plate. then my main course. instead of a quiche with some salad on the side what i had expected what i got was a huge plate of salad with the same ingredients i had in my starter salad and on the edge of the plate 6 or 7 cubes of very tasty quiche, but not half enough. i didnât want that whole plate of greens. the proportions in that quiche plate were all wrong. my friend enjoyed her ârundvlees met ratatouilleâ. being the only guests outside they seemed to forget us and we went in to have a coffee. and still no-one asked us whether we enjoyed our meal, whether we would like a dessert. inexperienced personnel? just bad luck? not an evening that triggers you to come back!"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
we arrived at 18.30 hrs and ordered a 5 course surprise me 
"had dinner here with my dad. it was the only place open on a tuesday, so we kind of had to go here. there was a huge group in the front, so we were glad that they had some other tables away from the "
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of â¬17,-. fries cost â¬6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
i had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at the photos on the websit 
i would love to rate the food and drinks but after making a reservation and showing up on time we left after 20 minutes. no service no server no questions. i understand when its busy things go slower but there were at least 6 waiters standing insi 
no idea how the food is. kitchen closes at 20h whilst they mention the restaurant closes at 22h. very confusing and no alternatives close by very dissapointing.
"very poor and slow service.  noisy, crying and running kids. food is not great. this restaurant is even worse than average dutch cafes"
more occupied of speed and sales than of the wellbeing of the customers. nice location but a litte cheap(ish)
"we went there because it was near to our holiday home and there were not many restaurants open that day. place is big but still feels cramped. food was very poor. io had a duck breast without any taste. it was served on an undefined kind of mashed potatoes that had no taste itself, but it was drowned in some gravy, of which i suspect it was just made of granules. next time when im in the neighborhood i will take a longer drive to find a decent for a dinner."
"it is always nice looking at the lake; so, this is a great place to meet othe "
the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at â¬1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."

"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldnât be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when itâs busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a âbroodje haringâ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"stopped here via boat for a drink and snack. beautiful view of lake and nice deck, but very slow and inattentive service. at the slow pace of service ran out of time to even order food..."
"together with a friend we had a nice stay, thanks to the great location and the nice, friendly services. the dishes on menu card are very average, probably still going strong (as most restaurants have), not a single surprise. we both chose for the spare ribs (3 half pieces p.p., but more than enough) with two sauces and some pommes frites, but nothing else served with it... the spare ribs were average of quality of meat, but tasteful (we give it the benefit of the doubt), the sauces (bbq and aioli) were good of taste (however do not kiss your partner afterwards...), but probably not fresh made. as a dessert we had the ananas panna cotta and the - old fashioned - dame blanche 2.0, both creative presented and very tasteful. the espresso and the cappuccino afterwards were of good quality."

"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"small restaurant with bad acoustics and really bad chairs. but we proceeded, against our first impression. it took them 35 minutes to get us three plates with âtapasâ. shrimps were still cold and watery from the fridge, the carpaccio was watery, the french frites were raw. the spare ribs in two small bowls were not bad. woth five we received a small bread, two slices per person. we asked to taste the âwineâ and was denied. bad tasting wine at a price of â¬ 6,50 per glass, ridiculous price for wine from the lidle. the salmon was really bad, out of the fridge. we had to pay to much, they wouldnât argue but in the end we received â¬30 back. still we payed way to much for bad prepared food."
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as itâs very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"ok. pizza is sick and soggy and very salty. parmigiana was very disappointed , aubergine was no fried, like a waterð no fresh herbs, without fresh basilicum it is not a real deal.. most of the dinner went to the garbage.. we had a bad tummy in a half hour.. shameâ¦ not anymore "
"we had dinner with friends. i found this to be a nice place, but i found the food to be average. service was good, the limoncello was not as it should (it was made with vodka) and the feeling in the dinning area is that you are in an old restaurant needing a rebuilt to give it a fresh look. you will not be disappointed if you eat there, but you wont be excited either."

"went into this restaurant with my family for a lunch time snack feeling a little hungry and left 1 hour and 15 mins later very hungry. a very busy lunch time all tables occupied with one chef and one waitress, talk about throwing away business left right and centre. cant rate the food because they forgot to write down our order. good idea for the management to call reimers and herman."
"ma moeder is located in the middle of the buzy shopping streets of hoogvliet. on a sunny saturday, which is just inviting for a lunch outside we selected ma moeder as our destination. menu card is not excessive, so with few dishes on the card, we expected good food as well. we selected a dutch delicatese kroket sandwich, however never have i seen such a sad dutch lunch before. kroket was warm and crisp (from the friture) - like we expected, but bun was cold. no butter was served along with the sandwish - only a small tube of mustard, which didnt even cover half the bun. no decoration on plate and anything elsewhich gives you are feel good experience. staff dressed in cargo pants and jeans shirt, so in my eyes not really presentable at a restaurant eith "

"nice atmosphere, food/drink was good, service was moderate, table reservation was not taken seriously."
boss is a bit loud with a faux friendly attitude. fake. my waitress was fairly welcoming but the one handling the payment was rude. they asked to be paid cash. cheese salad was was nice though. mineral water was good too. overall a disappointing experience.
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice. "
we dicide to eat something. after 20min of waiting for service were go somewher else!!! and that was the best decision.  dont go there!   there was bot so many ppl. it wasnt rush hour...
we stopped here simply for drinks. saantje has a pleasant outside terrace area. the inside looks good to 
"the fries are alright, but i had to wait ages to get them. even though there were just a few customers and seven people working..."
"terrible service. our order wasnât brought completely. bittergarnituur should be 16 pieces but weâve got 12 pieces. the calamaris didnât come at all. after saying our complaints 3 times they told us âi donât knowâ, the other person said: âi will check for youâ and didnât do anything at all. me and my friends will not come here in the future and i recommend you didnât either."
"told them we had 50 minutes to eat, they said no problem. 45 minutes later they told us they canât serve us and they have cancelled our order. skip this and go to san blas instead."
"the roast chicken and rose pinot grigio were nice. a coupe of service matters not so good. but seeing as erwin (at the bar) demonstrated that this place does actually value its customers, iâll just put those down to random bad luck!"
"to the snack counter: one of the worst customer experiences ever. staff was continuously talking to each other. because of that pretty slow service and messing up the orders. the male chef was super charming to his female colleague while chatting. but he was very rude to the customers. these were already talking to each other, upset because of the poor service and even poorer treatment by the chef. horrible!"
"parnassia has a nice terrace. the menu looks okay, although on the pricey side. waiters asked us literally every minute if we had made our choice already, a bit too eager to my tast "
"modern beach club with a long history and beautiful terrace with view on the beach. the friendly waitress served us a average caesar salad (iceberg lettuce, chicken, cheese and dressing), we had better lunches this week."
the location is really beautiful at he top of a dune. perfect place for a sundowner. the service is pretty chaotic. there are many people running around but it is not always easy to get ones attention. the first two orders were sold out. my third choice was just ok. cleanliness in times of corona can also be better.
this place definitely needs competition. being in a monopolist position for ages at this location successive managers apparently never felt the need to provide their guests a better service (cheeky staff members) and value for money. enjoy the beach but spend your money elsewhere.
"this restaurant has one option for gluten/lactose intolerant person ( double checked with the manager), chicken breast. got them raw, not only once but twice(after sending them back)! before i was able to take a second zip from my drink the waiter took it. so no food and nothing to drink! i would recommend the beach for your dog but not this restaurant!"
"if its busy, service is slow. if it isnt, the place will be understaffed, and service is slow. its the only game in town, so tough luck."
dropped in for a short coffee break during my bike ride from zaandvort. ordered coffee and pie. didnt get my order for over 15 minutes. when someone came by to ask if everything is okay they told me that my order got screwed up with another table. they promised me i would get it now very soon. after again way over 10 minutes i was just about to leave when it finally arrived. now they said it had been ordered for the wrong table number. didnt seem very apologetic. pie was okay but nothing to write home about. coffee was too small for the price.
"on the only sunny day so far of our first dutch summer, we decided to take our family to the beach. after the cycle to bloemendaal aan zee, the sight of t eindpunt was irresistable; the views from the outdoor seating area were beautiful and the drinks on other guests tables looked very tempti "

t eindpunt is a good place to eat after a day at the beach. staff is friendly. food is ok and served quickly. pricing is average. dining outside is fine but be aware of the direction of the wind otherwise your fun will be ruined.
nice restaurant we have been going to for years. menu us ok and food quality is good. unfortunately not really good options for vegetarians nor for vegans. that is a bit if a shame as more and more people follow such diets.
"played here as a child, hiding in the hollow tree (now a bronze replica) and spending energy running up and down the dunes. now apple-speck pancakes for old times sake."
"visited middle of the heatwave and charged 3 euro for a jug of tap water - why you ask (?) because i was told the germans always ask for it - so what, itâs water from a tap and i had two thirsty children - nope, still 3 euros. quite unbelievable - have never paid for tap water anywhere. "
"if you are extremely hungry and looking for just a quick meal with nice pancakes and you are without children, you should no go here "
we were a party of 6 looking to eat a snack . . . . pancak 
"the location is good for a quick bite when you are heading to or from zandvoort. we tried several pancakes and i must say that their pancakes are average. some pancakes were ok but some were not that tasty, it misses something. but its good for a quick snack. "
"the location is great. it takes, however, very long to order and even longer to get what you ordered. the lemonade is good, the food is just ok, but not if you take the expensive prices into consideration. there are better places around."
"we wanted to eat something on the beach in bloomingdale and spontaneously went to the beach club. we were allowed to choose a table and from then on it was over with the service. everyone who came after us was served except us. only when my wife went to serve did someone come to our table. we were served reluctantly, probably because we are germans. no recommendation!!!"
"the food itself tasted fine, actually it was such a small portion that we need to go to the fastfood place around the corner to eat something else. unfortunately the prices say something different. "
"we went for drinks on a sunny busy afternoon. we were with 3 people and 3 more were joining quickly after, so we asked a 6 persons table. this was not possible because they only give tables to âfull groupsâ?! when our 3 friends arrived there was a still a table next to us available so we asked personnel if our friends could sit there, which was agreed to. when they wanted to sit down, it was suddenly not possible anymore, because we were not a âfull groupâ from te beginning?! very rude and we left. 1 star is for the pornstar martini which was good. however i will drink my martini somewhere else next time. not recommend "
evening visit. noisy. busy. food average. service slow.   good location on beach and for families during the day might be better.   no return for me.
we were there on a day the weather was not very sunny and likely to rain so there were not many people. the service was quick and ok. prices are as expected near beach rather high.
"service was appalling. once we had eaten, plates were not cleared. neither were the tables around us. by the time we paid the table next to us had been piled with half eaten smelly leftovers for an hour. it actually made me sick. even specifically asking a waitress to clear our plates failed, she just took another tableâs money and left never to retur "
"i waited about 20 min before asking the hostess how can i order. she said i had to wait for a waiter to come for my order. well, ok house rules. waited another 15mins counting how many waiters pass by me and on â5â i just left. "
what an amazing view. and there it stop 
i found this place over-priced to say the least and we only had dri 
"we asked for an english menu, which came after 15 minutes; the waitress was rude, arrogant and helpless, she forgot the beer and she insisted in saying i didnt order ir, so she borought after 10 minutes. food is average, do not order cocktails cos they are not worth at all. service is the worst experienced in the latest years. "
"great location, nice loungy music and a beautiful setting, that is about it for the positives. pretty much everything else was wrong. no one came to serve our table, we waited, runners will not serve tables (understandable) but waiter never came. flagged one down for drinks and dinner. it was 17:45, kitchen opened at 18:00 so we could not order but also menu was not offered. took our drinks order, attitude was snotty & arrogant. drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, one of the pepsi bottles was used?! about 1/3 of the bottle was empty, we needed to inform the staff. no apologies and it took another 5 mins for replacement. for the rest, dirty tables are left dirty, menus are not cleaned away, ashtrays not cleaned. loungers are at an extra â¬ but even these guests had to go to the bar to order. i saw rubbish on tables and floors that was not cleaned, broken glass that was not cleared etc. staff does not seem to be bothered to serve or work in general. softdrinks at â¬3,50 for 0,2l are expensive, due to location but we left without ordering food or asking for the menu. no comment from the waiter when we did not ask for a menu or order food but he was even expecting a tip which was the icing on the cake. would not recommend, place needs training and proper management. wish i had checked reviews before we sat down."
"from opening the door there was an immediate feeling that we had entered the twilight zone, but as good masochists we stayed to see what this place can offer. the staff was running around in a zombie like state, and nobody noticed us. finally we managed to draw the attention of one of them, and were pointed at an available table. everything that we ordered was disgusting and not as described on the menu. bruschetta with burrata. never seen anything like th "

"keep looking for a top spot and move up north 20-50 km, this is one of those places people go to be seen but nothing special and you pay a tough price..."
there is one thing i have to admit: this place has a good location other than that i would not suggest this place at all. first of all we waited around 20min until the waiter came to take the order. then we specifically had to ask to clean the table of the previous guests. once i had ordered a burger of 17â¬ i receive have of a portion of fries. this is disappointed me in service and i have to say its not worth my money at all. this was my first and absolute last time. 
bloomingdale beach club is famous and a pace to be or a hot spot or whatev 
"since the sun came out again today we decided to go for a walk with the dog in the late afternoon and chilled out afterwards @ bloomingedales with some nice but rather expensive drinks followed by a dinner. our friend had a steak dinner, my hubby the tuna and i had the chicken sateh. it all tasted good and the good thing is that you can take your dog with you!"
"avoid this place at all costs. the setting is great which makes it tempting, but it isnt worth it. the staff were disinterested and - at times - openly rude. our order was completely messed up, the food is expensive and although we didnt let this place ruin a lovely day out, we certainly would never return. "
dropped by for some dinner and cocktails. it was pretty difficult to place an order since the staff wasnt paying any attention. after asking three runners to get somebody to take our order we finally met a waitress at our table. roughly 20 minuten had passer and the place was only occupied for  
very bad experience. slow waiters and very long waiting time for drinks and food.   cheesy waiters.  no go for this first sunny day of the year.
"we went for a lunch at the wellknown beachclub and were astonished about (lack of) service and quality, something we are not used of this beachcl "
"in this place i had possibly the worst burger (and meal!) ever! in my opinion overpriced, we paid 48â¬ for two burgers and a kid menu. the burger was small and not good quality and some of the fries were burnt. absolutely not recommended."
"i ate at stach march 2015 during a business trip. the staff was friendly, service quick and the salad was very good. a very dutch restaurant with clean modern lines, lots of windows and black frames. very relaxing. a cool thing is that they have a little grocery with take away lunches, sandwiches, curry, soups, and lots of chocolate!!!!"
"this is an atmospheric pub/restaurant, a nice place to visit, some of the food is great, some is not, it simply depends on what you get. but still worth a look!"
"two of us visited here, i had a mixed grill, which was excellent, a perfectly cooked selection of steak, pork, chicken and lamb, all very nicely presented and with good servi "
they are not friendly. iâll never come here again. the way they treat their staff. ð¤® a big fat no!!
we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff donât seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend. 
food was good and ok but very unkind waiter also to my child of 4 years. very unsociable and not friendl.
"we came for dinner with 4 people on a wednesday night. we had to wait a long time before we could order and after 40 minutes bread still had not arrived, we had to go and search for the waitress. when the bread did arrived it came at the same time as our starters. there was a large group of people having dinner in another room and the staff was busy. we also had to wait very long for the main courses and to get another drink, another search for the staff was needed. no excuus from the staff nothing, we didnt feel welcome here! the food was nothing special, nice fish but no vegetables were served only a bowl of salad to share with 4 people and some fries."
"probably the best fast food/ fries place in the area. this is our regular supplier for a once-a-week fast food lunch with team. quality is consistent. on bank holidays, or on moment when you would expect the place to be open, then .... it is closed. and they can afford to do this, as theres no real competition in the are "
"nice terrace on eersels market square , great ambiance, good seati "
"we enjoyed the ice cream very much but sadly as the card machine didnât seem to accept international cards of any kind (pre-paid, debit, credit) which had worked elsewhere, we had to sit around with small children for over an hour while one member of our party travelled to the next town to withdraw cash. there should be a sign advising this."
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.
"it was quiet in the restaurant. i ordered soup and sandwiches. the sweet potato soup was tasteless. when asked by the staff if the food was good, i told them i didnt like the soup at all. no reaction or comment whatsoever. they didnt seem to care at al "
"expectations were high but unfortumately the restaurant did not met the expectations. the staff was good but very informal. the wait for the food was very long. the bar was occupied by non-restaurant guests so it was like you had dinner in a bar in stead of a restaurant. the food was good, the presentation was good but the portions are small. price range quite high. lets say an average of â¬ 35 per couvert. a lot of loud people where it seems that everyone knows everyone. an incrowd place and not very inviting for outsiders. an end result with a 6. just ok."
"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is okÃ© except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"after three weeks vacation in the united states and got the american fries, this place was really my first destination after landing at schipol airport. hmmmâ¦."
"not what youâd call service with a smile. lady was particularly grumpy! chips were good, very handy quick lunch for us. cheese sauce dreadful, curry sauce delicious, way too much ketchup all over the top of the chips."
a proper dutch snack when having been abroad too long. i think the quality is just average and i always have to get used to dutch assertiveness again â¦ but who cares â¦ give me my kroket!
"this review is for vlaamse frites in reguliersbreestraat, amsterdam as i cannot find it in their listing. their fries are fresh and taste awesome. lots of sauces to choose from. i loved them with mayonnaise. actually, its too much mayonnaise but its fine, you are anyways gonna burn it walking in amsterdam!"
the probleem of this place is not opofferen it is good or b 
"baguette with salmon, there are better and tastier; overpriced. cup of coffee, only brown coloured hot water.  cognition: rip-off."
"the cheese roll, yoghurt and apple pie were good to eat but the young person serving me had more interest in her friend than trying to serve me. i appeared to be a problem asking for english breakfast tea and hadnt been replenished on the serving table. she may be identified as 603408 eden "
avoid this place at all costs.  paid in pounds and was given less euros. a bill for 15cent euro ended up paying 3 euros.  the manager couldnt help but got very furious when i showed them their reviews
avoid this place as i was double charged for my food! i was in a hurry and tapped my credit card and when i got back to the states - a sandwich and banana should of cost me $12 ended up getting charged twice and see 2 charges of $12. evidenced in my credit card statement. 
"we got a couple of beers and sandwiches which were heated quickly, but there were many disgruntled customers waiting for burgers and other food for at least half an hour and even one guy just waiting for a beer. several employees, most just standing around. appeared to be very poorly and inefficiently managed, service was a little snipp "
"waited over 20mins for my food to arrive. i went up and asked how long, a very rude member of staff told me just to wait. then he tried to serve me food that had been sat there for 10mins, which i refused. i had ordered fish and chips. it looked nothing like it!!!! then suddenly another appeared after i refused the first one. i was not confident that that was made fresh so again refused this one. the extremely rude server made a comment, in dutch, so couldnât understand it. so i got a refun "
"â¬7.10 for a can of beer (a âbottle depositâ of â¬0.15 charged, even though it was a can) and â¬8.45 for a ham sandwich. ridiculous prices."
"i expect an airport restaurant to be ridiculously overpriced. this place didnt disappoint in that regard: 16 euros for a burger and over 4 euros for a coke. however, theres no excuse for bad service and an equally bad response. before i ordered, i talked to the guy who was doing the cooking. i wanted an absolutely plain burger. no condiments. no seasoning. just the plain meat. we talked for a full minute and he assured me he would make a plain burger for me. i waited about 15 minutes and then the burger was ready. when i walked up to the counter, i immediately saw that the burger was not plain. it had lettuce, tomato and mayo on it. the cook yelled over that it was plain but then came over and saw for himself that it was not. instead of offering to prepare a new plate, he started scraping the condiments off and put the patty on a new roll. hard to do this with mayo on the patty! they have their ketchup in small plastic containers. i asked the woman behind the counter for an extra container so i could kill any leftover taste of the mayo and she refused, saying we charge extra for those! she had zero customer handling skills, especially in light of their mistake. i see from other reviewers that poor customer service seems to be a recurring theme here. i dont expect that the restaurant will improve because of my review nor do i expect others to avoid this place because of it. but bad service should be called out."
"10 years living in the netherlands and this airport (inside) is still a overpriced, rodent invested, lacking in customer service, mismanged, false advertised and uncompetive peice of crud. hms host and their staff and the worst i think not a single one lnows haccp, the food choices are bread or bread. plus the staff are treated like dirt hence the reason nobody wants to work here."
"poor cappucino, is was too hot and bad taste. one of the  table or bar was uncleaned. there was empy dish. service was slow."
"like most airports drinks are relatively expensive, likewise snack food. area can be quite busy and as some people in a rush very little attention to social distancing.  apple pie is quite nice and tasty."
ordered burger with coke tom 30 minutes before the burger was finished  fries were ok but the burger was red inside complaining did not work they said that was there way to do it never again there
their staff was not giving any attention to customers. unpolitisch and rough. questions were not answered properly. the tables were inaccessible and no allowance to rest! notably in a restaurant.
"drinks in harvest market 654 look overpriced. 4.95 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. the seats next to us were not cleaned with dirts all over the place. the cashier was grumpy. what a place, but seemingly the last one at the end of the terminal."
"we went to hms host schiphol airport during departure from amsterdam in the last trip before quarantine, just few days before it start "
"after arriving at 07:30 on a flight from prague into the schiphol airport, we were starving for breakfast. the hms host schiphol restaurant looked inviting. we ordered a 3 egg omelet and 3 fried eggs, both came with a side of bacon. my partner ordered a diet coke as well. average typical airport food quality and service. total cost for two: â¬22.75."
"well, we never come here with big expectations and so we dont get disappointed. average quality with sometimes slow service. but at least expensive. :)"
i had a great coffee and opted for a beef burger as i was really hungry. i was glad i did not order the scrambled eggs as other customers had because they looked overcooked and unappealing. i thought 16 euro for a burger and coffee was quite expensive but i looked around and there was not much else available.
"due to an unexpected layover we needed to get some lunch. we chose hms host because it seemed rather busy and was on our way. we learned it was not the greatest choice. neither the food nor the service were very good. however, sometimes necessity out weighs selectivity. i must say there was plenty and we were ready to move forward."
"while waiting for a connecting flight we dropped in past this cafe for a quick snack,  and  the coffee and apple cake was very tasty."
"i stopped here before getting on my flight. i got the americano coffee and yogurt with some mango bits mixed in. the yogurt tasted very fresh and healthy. coffee was strong, but i left it in the bathroom and by the time i realized that and came back, the bathroom attendant had already disposed of it. oh well!"
ordered a vegan cup just 4.50 but charged me a salad cost 7. 
"in transit at schipol airport and desperate for a hot drink, we came to hms host and ordered two hot chocolates. they were small, no more than room temperature and cost 7.30 euros. a complete waste of money. avoid."
for airport bar this was not exceptional but functional and service was quick and good drinks were of good quality and price not overly expensive
"only ate here because it was close to my departure gate. i wouldnât have chosen it if there had been other options. the fish sandwich wasnât very good, and the bacon and egg crepe was passable. helpful and friendly cashiers, though."
"naturally fast food was extremely slow and the staff was incompetent. the food we got served was cold. when we took a tray he said we took the wrong tray, meaning he wanted to put the receipt on our tray instead of a new tray he could just have grabbed. when watching customers weâre served coffee in to go cups but there were no kids that fit the larger cups. all in all...not great"
i did not realize that this was a starbucks when i first went but the service was good and the coffee was too.
"ordered gourmet extra cheese burger and cappuccino. run by kids, not very clean, initially they gave my burger away, then put a sheet of cheese on the other guyys burger and gave me his. coffee was half full, salad turning and coleslaw looked and tasted half dead. apart from that it was what i expected from airport food. gives street food a bad name."
"crazy prices! not so much choice in the mornings and people working there not friendly at all, so tired not even see you standing in front of them."
"used a kebab place in the airport... well where do we start... we wanted burger, they had no burgers, wanted a chicken burger.. none of them either. "
avoid this spot if you are having lun 
"was ok for the momento, just eat and  "
the cost of 2 very pricey lattes was 6.80 euros almost 10 canadian dollars served in paper cups and to top it all off they didnt have any lids.
"we ate lunch for satay chicken 20,25 â¬ and burger 20,75 â¬. awfull mess. never again. quality - price is poor."
"after standing in front of the restaurant waiting to get seated an employee told me to just pick a seat...in doing so another employee comes and says that i need to queue up for being seated. after telling him, that this was exactly what i did, he insisted to get me back to the start of the line. asking for his supervisor i needed to wait for quite some time and then explaining the manager what happened she was very unprofessional and noch customer oriented, telling me that she hears two different stories (from her employee and me) and does not want to find out what really happened. neither she or the employee who sent me back to the row expressed any sorry for the inconveniences....and this even although there were other people that had seen the whole story. i finally got a seat and some food (which was ok but not at all really good or even outstanding) but now at 20:00 they stopped serving food (as i wanted tom order a dessert) although the restaurant does not close before 21: "
i really like food and wine here but it is not the first time people who work there donât know what customer service is! for place like schipol with such prices you have to invest in training for people who work for you so they know how to treat clients! especially if they dont speak dutch!!! very very dissappointing!!!!
ordered the bratwurst and fries and a lipton lemon drink.  the bratwurst was good enough to fill me up and keep going. choice of sauces at your disposal.  nothing too exciting but ok for a quick bite of cooked or cold meals.
"please doublecheck the products before buying. fresh juice in their minds is a pre-produced concentrated crap thay they sell for 5.90 a glass.  do not visit, go to another place, there are plenty on schiphol."
"i visited the hmshost heineken bar 152 at the top of the d gates whilst returning from marseille to bristol via amsterdam last week. i had time for a quick beer on the way from c gates to d gates and noticed the familiar green of a heineken bar. when it is a bar dedicated to a particular beer, you expect the best because there is no choice, only heineken. ok, so its not my favourite beer and , in my opinion, it ranks at the lower end of the scale against such beers as moretti, estrella damm, kirin ichiban and six point, however i do not object to a nice pint of heineken when time is short and it is the only bar in sight. it was not busy and i sat at the bar where two young girls were working. as soon as i sat down, one disappeared and the other began stacking glasses making sure that i had noticed her intentional ignorance. she made it clear that she had issued a challenge and, as i was short of time, i took up her challenge and said excuse me, can i have a pint of heineken please?. she looked around with an expression of disgust and replied when i have finished this. after a short time, she pulled a pint of heineken and requested five and a half euros. i paid the extortionate rate and took a gulp of the beer which was totally without gas. it was cold, granted, and it tasted like heineken, but it was flat. i called her back and explained that the beer was unsatisfactory. at this point, she said that she would provide a replacement. she pulled another beer and looked upon it noting that this one was lacking in fizz also. a male member of staff was now in attendance and he also pulled a half of the beer and gazed wistfully into the glass. they both then took the beer (her with the new pint and him with the half pint) into the back office to show yet another member of staff. i could see into this office from the bar and i observed many examinations of the glasses and much discussion therein. after around five minutes, i caught the eye of the male member of staff who had yet to venture from the back office and tapped my watch indicating that i needed a resolution to the matter before my flight departed. i was ignored and the original girl who had vacated the bar upon my initial arrival now re-appeared behind the bar. i said to her just give me a refund and i will be on my way to which she replied we cannot give a refund. i indicated to her that the beer was undrinkable. at this point i was starting to get a little agitated and within ten seconds, the male member of staff who had pulled a half of the beer to examine appeared from the back office, opened the till and gave me five and a half euros and apologised profusely about the matter. i was on my way again and i purchased a can of heineken at the shop at the gate (admittedly at the ridiculous price of five and a half euros). we all know that airport prices are a rip off but please, if youre going to rip us off, at least make sure that the product is fit for consumption!!!!!"
"this place is nothing really special, but it sure comes in handy when you need a quick bite to eat while waiting in schipol airport for your plane to depart. my wife had a yoghurt parfait type of thing, i had a caprese sandwich, and we each had sparking water. the food was just okay, the prices were slightly high (but that is expected in an airport), and the service was fast."
we had quick lunch before our flight back to ho 
this has got to be the slowest burger king i have ever visited. fifth person in the queue and waited 20 minutes to be served to get a microwaved childrens cheeseburger.
my wife and i wished to have something different rather than the usual fast food offering in airports so chose kebaya as it looked nice and the menu on the board was very appealing. the drinks were a bit pricey but its an airport restaurant! we ordered our meal using a state of the art  tablet device so thought we were at somewhere speci 
"visited their starbucks kiosk c - pier and it was efficient, good and costly but a very typical starbucks.  if youre looking for something to hold you over before a flight this works fine."
"terrible, expensive junk food. two hotdogs, one petite diet coke, 21.65 euros. rude waitress. yuck. we were in a hurry due to closely timed connections, but this experience in the airport was beyond awful. cold hotdogs. stale buns. rude service. next time, if were rushed, well skip eating anything here!"
+ smoking room next to cafe. - cold hotdogs for 8.95 eur but its ok to killing time. heineken draft beer - 5.55 eur
worst service i have ever experienced the waitress was so rude. as we had not finished our bottle of wine we asked for a cork so we could take it with us. the waitress responded with iâm busy ask at the bar. we asked her again as didnât know where the bar was and was in a rush for our flight with this the same waitress told us we were rude and started to argue with us. i will never set foot in here ever again 
we arrive 10 minutes before they close and we saw 4 burgers available but they hid them to eat themselves..the workers prefer steal the products than sell burgers for 7â¬. 0% natural place
we were waiting for a noon flight but had not had breakfast. we wanted to sit down so there was a counter to do s 
enjoyed a decent cup of coffee while waiting for my flight to glasgow but should have refrained from ordering a warm sausage roll which was large and rather stodgy.  7:40 euros was expensive for very average food.
"well, its not really a special restaurant. they have enough choice from sandwiches to warm food. snacks, salads, soup etc. we got 2 cheese rolls, a small bowl salade, fries and a bowl soup and..... it cost us â¬ 29,95. its expensive."
"thank you travel gods for airport cafÃ©s having real cups! the coffee tastes better and there is less waste. there must be a fb group dedicated to helping fellow travellers steal clear of styrofoam, paper cups with paper taste and pesky plastic lids!"
i has the looks of a fine asian restaurant at the airport but the food sadly is so insipid and tasteless and you pay a high price. i had miso ramen which was the worst i have ever had!
great location for a pre flight snack drink. clean tidy fast but be prepared for hefty charges as in the whole airport.
"the food is nice, but the prices are way to high. especially compared with the portions you get. there are better options."
"we ate here while waiting for our delayed plane. the lasagne was just fine, the pizza was ok, the beer was as it should be and the smoothie was ok as was the coffee."
"expensive, but tasty salmon sandwich ... in line with most airport prices. good location though, right in the middle of the terminal and large seating area. the view outside is also quite nice."
large assortiment in food and beverages   warm or cold. nice coffee.  good place to grab a snack just before your flight.  expansie but in line with other airports.  great view and terrace.
vast choices of restaurants at schiphol and we thought we would try the japanese restaura 
"good place to stop for a drink or snack, with views of planes and part of the runway, while you wait for your flight. not too expensive."
"everyone knows that eating outlets in airports are not cheap as they have a captive market, but given all the delicious food we had encountered on our trip, we at least expected reasoanble quality. there are a number of places to choose to eat and we would definitely not eat here again or recommend it when next passing through. the choice was very limited for drinks and food. my daughter and i ended up having very soggy and uninspiring, tepid pizza margharita with a beer, a diet coke and a chocolate milk. total cost 26 euros. my husband had an adequate burger from the counter next to this which was also overpriced. choose somewhere else to eat at the airport. it is a huge place and there are other choices."
"the coffee was good, but the ham and cheese sandwich was skimpy a banana and chocolate pastry was filling but not  wonderful"
stopped by to grab a quick bite before a trip. i had a sausage roll and a cheese roll. the cheese roll was quite good and much better than the sausage roll. the staff had a lot of customers going crazy and they handled our orders perfectly. excellent service. thank you!
i try to eat plenty of sashimi and sushi when travelling due to it being a healthy option. this airport location had a good choice and to be fair the food was good and fresh. service was good and you order you own dishes off a tablet menu with pictures of each dish which is a good way to see what you are getting. you can make worse choices in an airport. would return.
went to two of the hmshost opperated takeaway places. a breadstall and a grab&f 
place to stop by to have a sandwich and a drink before or after you take a flight or the train. ample sitting space. reasonable price.
"busy place with typical fast food you can find at the airport. nothing was too exquisite. sandwiches were, actually, awful, either empty or filled with chewy mea "
stopped in to get something to eat on the plane. options were limited but i got a bagel with cream cheese. probably got the wrong thing - was the worst bagel ive ever had.
nice place a bit hidden in the schiphol airport people are nice the food is good i got the two steaks forgot the name the one at 23â¬ it was too cooked for my taste the fully loaded burger is really big and good
"we blinked when we stopped here for a light lunch before our flight to the uk because we honestly thought wed been magically transported back to the wilds of north america where cardboard, tasteless take out food is the norm for a captive audience with no other options. the pizza was cold and lifeless as was the service. do yourself a favour and bypass this establishment."
food is very mediocre but they get away with it due to the captive audien 
had a piece of meat that was  cooked ok but the portion was not really so pleanty. the cost is not comparable to the quantity  probably  because its an airport.  it should be a bit more cost effettive.   the personel is friendly and quick.
once you have ordered food you might as well take the flight and come back at your leisure to collect your order. the staff are in no hurry whatsoever and will do everything to make your experience as lazy as thier service is. go to another place as there are plenty others at the airport. 
we were waiting for a connection flight and grabbed a sandwich and beer. the beer was offered extra cold and was very refreshing.  the sandwich was average but filled a gap. suggest this was better than others which looked worse!
had a terrible meal here that was not good at all. food was not warm and the prices where high.  will grab a snickers in the kiosk next time i feel hungry here.
nothing special but good enough. staff are friendly. note this is the kitchen near the casino. had omelette. did the job
"we had a slice of pizza, bread with smoked salmon, daysoup, 2 cofefe and 1 medium diet coke. 30 euros, do i need to say mo "
expensive for a cappuccino from an automatic machine (no moka) and a watered down powder made orange juice. the muffin was ok.
"this looked a lovely place inside the airport at the harvest market. however, it was so disappointing. 5 minutes before 11am they wouldnt serve a full english breakfast (even though service was until 11). i went for a cheese and chicken panini which was all dried up. the danish pastry was also dry. poor service and sub-standard food. could have been so much better. awful food and poor service. maybe it was a bad day? but it was only 10.55 am!"
"the food or drink you get is ok for a quick bite, but you will not be given a surprised by a huge quality. i have had better quality on other airports."
"my credit card bill shows hms host as charging for our meal, but reading the other reviews some clearly refer to landside outlets, other to airside outlets. this review covers the dutch kitchen, airside in the non-schengen part of the schiphol airport (so i think between piers e and f, near where the old rijksmuseum outlet used to b "
"this is very calm place away from the crowds--to reach it you must go up some stairs away from the rest of the airport. it is next to an outdoor area that gives you a nice view of the airport. we used it to kill some time while waiting for our flight. the service was very friendly and they have a nice variety of items ranging from cold sandwiches, paninis, lots of desserts, coffees and a wide variety of drinks including beer. the variety extends even beyond what ive listed. my chicken teriyaki sandwich was pretty good but ive had better. my wife loved what she got. prices were very reasonable by u.s. airport standards. all in all, this is a pretty nice place with, again, very friendly service."
"food is ok but the staff are slow in serving/preparing the food behind the counters, apart from the pizza section where they were speedy. there were long queues for most food counters i am sure because of the slow service. anyway, its fine for a pre-travel meal. "
"not good. a toasted panini with uncooked coronation chicken. they replaced it, but the replacement (bacon and egg) was oosing in fat. an all-round bad experience."
"right opposite the arrivals gates at terminal 3, this is a useful spot to wait for arriving friends/family. whilst waiting we had a cappuccino and a latte. both were very good and each was 3.75 e. didnt have any food but they seem to have the usual dutch snack foods."
coffee weak.  apple pie freezing cold.  moarella baguette tasteless.  insufficient staff to clear tables  what has happened to catering at airports?
"terrible, we arrived, sat down by the bar, waited for 10 minutes and no one came to take our order. barman was just in front of us and did not acknowledge us at all."
"it is nice and the view was ok, but i think you could turn the music down a little! the food was a solid 9/10 and the water was perfect temperature!!!!!!! but i think that a drinks menu would be good.the chicken burger was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the restaurant was very bright and happy!!! overall 4. "
the worst experience ive had in an airport restaura 
"the menu was reduced to 3 itemsâ¦ count them, 3. because a âmachineâ was broken. also, despite having menus in the comfy area, you couldnât order there and we had to move seats. ridiculous place."
"ordered few beers and top range burger, burger was ok, nothing special but not too bad eithe "
"decent food, crap service, charged extra for sauces, fries and what knows what although they were included in the menu. small amounts, but the feeling of being scammed is there"
"wrong order, wrong check and nobody care about the mistake. also its not easy to get the waitress to order second drink â¹ï¸â¹ï¸â¹ï¸"
"today on 29october the waiter was friendly,a time ago i meet some waiter there and he was realy not like his j "
we sat at a table waiting for service for ten minutes. it was not busy and the staff never acknowledged us so we ended up leaving.
we had a couple hours before our flight and decided to have some drinks. the restaurant wasnt very busy and it seemed there were only two staff workin 
"absolutely awful. slow service, rubbish food and extremely over priced. â¬7.30 for a bottle of still water. then added money for ketchup and mayo that we didnât ask for. â¬23 for a burger thatâs not even good. avoid."
honestly horrible !!! service absolutely bad! cuttlery thrown literally at our face! quality black angus burger patty? not even in dreams. the meat taste like frozen frikandelle from a city fair truck! nothing to eat or drink there. definitely not worth the overpricing!
"i ordered drinks about 4 times and nobody brought the drinks so iâve finished my meal without any drink, they brought just one drink of the four iâve ordered at the end when i didnât even want it anymore. the waitress didnât even show up so it was very difficult to talk with her. so the service is nothing good for me."
the waitress did an appalling job of taking our ordering managed to get most of wrong. the food was delivered to the table and they almost flung it at us and went before we could say it was wrong at this point we were hungry and with our flight time getting closer we eat what we were give 
unbelievable slow service (20+ min just to be able to place order). way understaffed. the staff that was there didnt seem to care about customers having to wait.
"we got our drinks and food quickly, but the server never cane back. we needed refills of water and more drinks, but our server disappeared and nobody else came. we were charged for eight small containers of ketchup and mayonnaise that we didnât order! we had to search for someone to pay and was then informed that they donât divide checks. that is fine, but i have never eaten anywhere that didnât communicate that before guests order their food. then when i checked my american express statement, they charged me twice! thank goodness, american express sorted this out for me! lesson learned- i should have checked the reviews before eating here."
"horrible service.  three tables ordered and served drinks before we decided to leave.  had plenty of time between flights, but 20 minutes if being ignored is unconscionable."
the common theme of the restaurant is food roulette. the drinks came out at a lighting pace to quench the thirst. the food however was a different story. when the food finally arrived the order was wrong and missing items. turns out the chef canât read an order and nor can the server put half of it into the til 
"good choice of dishes,  not the usual airport selection. food freshly cooked in front of you. good service.  downside,  tables not cleaned between customers"
just appalling. food inedible. i think customers are expected to clear their own tables...see pictures... really was awful. if you want a burger go to mcdonalds...twice as nice and half the price ð
"i thought id get a lunch time snack here last week. i paid for it, but after half an hour it still hadnt turned up and i had a plane to catch. couldnt get a refund because the person whod taken the order had gone, and when they offered to give me a take away and promised they were bagging it up, even then after five minutes i was standing at the bar wondering where it was and just had to give up and get my pla "
"we had to search the restaurant for a table, once we finally found a table we had to then go and find menus as there were only kitchen staff and one lady behind the bar. whilst sitting we saw 5 mice running around the restaurant and under the food cabinets, so we very quickly left!"
"was confusing as we sat down and didnt get served. eventually went to bar and they said we are sitting in the wrong area and cant help, went to kitchen counter and was told quite abruptly to sit and wait for someone to come..when i said we had been waiting for a while they explained that our seating was outside of their restaurant. we had their restaurants menu on our table which had caused the confusion. thats all fine but then make a polite suggestion that we sit in the designated area to be served...not just say sorry cant do it! ð when we did move we still had to wait a while for the one poor waitress to come to us, and the miserable kitchen staff just snapped at her. terrible customer service... "
"horrible and angry service, not enough staff making the ones that are there to be angry. on google it says that they close at 21:30 however at 20:30 they send us away. when we asked if drinks were still possible they said no. even though the bar is still open. so we go to the bar and they are discussing their own times for closing even though its busy there. so we get served at the bar and want to find a seat. we pick a table where others are sitting as well. and they send us away even though other people are still sitting there with their drin "
"i ordered a rib eye but they told me it is not available. few minutes later another man ordered rib eye no problem. wtf? so i ordered burger, it was pre-heated and made probably few hours ago, came very dry and taste less. this place is not recommended."
very rude cook was very sarcaric. then completely ignored by the waiter.gave up after 15 mins and went to another restraunt.tbe place wasnt even that busy.
ordered the classic burger and a beer whilst waiting for the flig 
"absolutely terrible service from the bar staff, arrived at 8:40 told closed but then continued to serve others, swore at customer when asked why , i work for heineken and pass through here often , i was ashamed that they sell our brand if this is the serve they provide."
"i travel a fair bit for workâ¦ i donât think iâve ever had service poor enough to inspire me to write a review before. i never got the drink i ordered, the cesar salad was not very good, and service was inattentive even by european standards. think you have plenty of time to grab a bite to eat and still make your flight? maybe not if you eat here!"
"sat down with my partner and was approached by the old man waiter claiming i have to buy food to sit down and not just a drink, he got very aggressive when i told him no one else was eating around us only drinki "
"the waiter / manager was incredibly rude constantly albeit being the only server at the very busy restaurant- no excuse for complaining heavily to us when we asked for some ketchup that we didnt order it with the meal, then the drinks order was wrong and we was very polite at asking for the correct order.. again huge lamentation and when we arrived to ask for a table was just dismissed - it is very expensive but this is hands nmdown the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life! avoid!!"
"absolutely shocking service, waiters very rude. forgot parts of the order and then took a long time to rectify their mistake. also seen them being very rude to people who simply wanted to order. i could understand if the place was very busy but it honestly wasnât that busy with many empty seats."
"i had the vegan seaweed burger. super tasty i have to say but not worth 21 euro. i know airport restaurants have hefty rents to pay, but still. to add further insult you get charged extra for ketchup and mayonnaise even though when youâre offered them itâs not obvious youâre being âupsoldâ. also, they wonât give you a glass of delicious dutch tap water. oh no, you have to buy a bottle of imported french water - 4.25euro for 25cl."
was told to pay later! barman put extra drink on! and said we ordered â¬14!  gave cash bk when caugh!!
"quite a comical visit to be honest. came at a time when airport was fairly busy. the restaurant had only one waiter, a few barman and a couple of chefs. the waiter was shouting to everyone who walked in the place this area is closed and was generally storming around very moody. we had asked a few questions on the menu and got back very rude and sarcastic replies from the einstein lookalike. icing on the cake was, our burger finally arrived which was a beef burger rather than the chicken burger we ordered. as we pointed this out the waiters response was... ok my mistake i will give this away and refund you thanks bye after we had just waited 30 minutes for the burger to be prepared."
"came here during a weeknight around 5pm, sat for 30 minutes before anyone even came to serve. despite asking for a menu / drink on 3 occassions. eventually they came over and asked if i had been served yet.. then advised me not to order as they were having technical issue "
"just got 2 coffees from that place, found out i had to pay â¬13 for those 2 âdirty watersâ as coffee is a big word. awful! a legal robbery"
"unfriendly people legit so unhappy and rude, wanted to order something and the man with the grey hair is just unfriendly and rude"
"not the easiest review to do. the food, we both had the chicken burger, was nice, dressings were fresh and wasnt greasy at all, a good 3/5 however the service was shocki "
"last time i was here i ate in the jamie oliver restaurant. never again.....that was dire. this was so much better. the service was speedy, the food good, usual airport prices but thats to be expected. would choose this again when im next in schipol in july."
"we had a completely incompetent waitress. despite being very clear when we ordered, our food had to be brought back twice and it still ended up being wrong. she gave us the completely wrong burgers that were more expensive than the ones we originally ordered, instead of having them been taken back for a third time we just ate them and they said they would only charge for the ones we originally ordered. she then tried to charge for the more expensive ones again when we went to pay, if we hadnt been so thorough she may have gotten away with charging us more. she didnt apologise for any of the mistakes at all and at one point said we had ordered something that we didnt order. it was hard to enjoy the food or find any appealing feature when the service was that bad."
"the 1st time i went was february 2022, somehow they lost my orded so i had to wait ages. this time i ordered and waited for ages anyway, the only good thing is that i wasnt the only one waiting. luckily my plan was delayed."
"the waiter was just straight up rude and racist , didnât see him give the same treatment to other caucasian customers. had to wait around to get service for a while . was just here for a layover but i vow never to eat /stop here again."
this was ok - a little over priced for the food that was served. probably will try a different main meal during my next layover however
"been here a few times now. normally, service has been very good. due to covid it has been quite quiet, but they are losing a lot of custom due to lack of staff and very slow service as a result. no signs indicating if table service or food/drinks only areas. people walked back out as they were asking me if i worked there and if there were any staff available! i realise its difficult to keep staff available at these times, but customers must be given the impression that they will get served even if it takes time. "
"excellent food, service mixed. orders were lost in translation, but eventually we got more or less what we ordered. the staff were very pleasant but didnt confirm the order correctly. the food was fantastic, very tasty and nicely presented. we would eat here again but ensure the water understands before finishing the order."
"i have enough during the connection in the airport, and chose this cafÃ© for lunch. the cafÃ© looks quite presentable, and this determined my choice. for my amazement, the reality was, softly said, a little bit different. there were a few of visitors in the cafÃ© but i waited a waitperson to make an order a lot of time. only accumulated tiredness and a really comfortable chair prevented me from simply getting up and leaving. the waitpersons discussed something near the bar counter, and i was obliged to come, go there and remind about my existence. the received lobster soup was slightly warm (however, the tea was really good). this cafÃ© is not an eating house, and it looks different indeed when compared to the other cafÃ©s in the area. therefore, the expectations are appropriate. it remains to hope that it was like an exception in my case. sometimes, such exceptions occur. "
the staff were very slow and rude. i ended up not buying anything but still sat in their lounge.  find other places to spend your money.
worst service there has been over this weekend. oeuf cocotte overcooked and so late my cup of tea had gone cold whilst waiting
"acted as though they were doing me a favor, by seating us and allowing us to eat here.  staff never checked to see if food was good, if we had what we needed â¦. will avoid in the future!"
"i would love to be able to make contact with the owners. what a disgraceful place, lots of staff doing nothing and extremely rude. i had to clean the chair as it was covered in butter, floor filthy table filthy, at this rate i should have left. waited thirty minutes to order , received a tiny glass of champagne, and another fourty five mins later i received oven baked eggs that were microwaved and the waiter giving out hell to me for ordering breakfast that was clearly marked all day breakfast on the menu, disgusting food. i asked for the manager and was ignored went to the counter and a lady who was clearly not the manager told me that she was, i explained my experience and she actually grunted at me, offered no apology, and charged full price of â¬28, guess they get a lot of complaints and are used to  "
"cocoâs should learn basic french if serving french items. hear me out, this isnât an âonly real french food is goodâ rant. i came to the airport very early for a transatlantic flight. surprisingly, lines were short and i had time for a coffee and a croissant at cocoâs. after being directed away from an open one person seat at the bar to a long line a waiting patrons and waiting 20 mins only to be seated in the same seat i originally was told to leave, i brushed off my irritation and looked forward to the âlarge cafe crÃ¨meâ and croissant on the menu. i had to ask for the menu and the waiter was irritated that i could not order off the bat. everything that was being served to other patrons though looked goo "
"i am disappointed with this placeâ¦ l travel through amsterdam airport all the time and always see the place busy and never get chance to call in however, today l di "
i was there with 3 friends. we waited to be seated and after 5 minutes i ask a guy behind the bar âare you ope

waited 18 mins - couldnât get anyones attention then finally i was able to ask the girl behind the bar for a glass of champagne. wanted to have lunch but they took too long. lots of visiting amongst the staff with each other - they need to get to work!
"stopped for what i was hoping would be a nice cup of hot chocolate. sat down right in front of the till. went there to order after about 10 minutes, but was told that they have table service. yeah, righ "
"we stopped off at cafe coco for what we thought would be a quick coffee. after waiting for 15 minutes to be served, i approached the bar and was promptly told to return to the table as there was a waiter who would take our ord "
"a group of four, well seasoned travelers, we first could not get the staff to clean the counter of dishes (at least 10 minutes from the previous customers). when we ordered 4 hot chocolates we were served 1 with no others in site for 5 minutes. we asked about our drinks and wanted to order food. we were ignored. after another 5 minutes we were told it was coming. after another 5 minutes we asked for a manager. we were told no one was in charge. the attitude was arrogant. this is not the service we have experienced in the past at schiphol airport. avoid if possible."
"second time in less than a month where they have let themselves down with the service, or should i say lack of  "
"this is the hardest that i have ever worked to get a coffee. the staff were rude, unhelpful and arrogant (except for the lone guy working there who should be put in charge of staff training, starting with teaching the others how to smile - it really was that poor). i still donât understand the seating arrangements and neither did the vast majority of other customers that the staff spent the bulk of their time moving on, rather than getting on with their jobs serving. avoid like the plague."
"do not bother to waste your time and money going here. the service is the most appalling i have had in a very long time. we arrived and sat down, happy to try what looks like a lovely cafeteria in the middle of a busy airport and proceeded to be ignored by all staff. until we decided "
first and last time to this place. â¬10+ for a coffee and croissant and needed to wait 30 mins while âthey prepare itâ. really poor.
"arrived early morning after sleepless overnight flight and looking for a spirit-lifting breakfast at schiphol. cafe coco looked like the right place: attractive setting, varied and seemingly sophisticated menu, courteous personnel. unfortunately, the place is not up to its promise mainly due to the total lack of flexibility and customer attention. they have smoked fish platters on the menu and i request just a simple plate of smoked salmon with a slice of toasted bread: impossible! there is no kind of bread in this fancy place (?!?). i end up ordering a weird egg soufflÃ© topped with two slices of smoked salmon which has all the skin and the dark parts on each slice, and has been significantly heated by the underlying hot egg stuff (which is not particularly tasty). at the end i ask for more hot water in my teapot (tea was made with real leaves and a pretty good brand, in all fairness) and they reply that for hot water i have to pay for a new tea (nearly 5 euros!) even if i use the same leaves. dutch rigidity? or just plain lack of attention to customer satisfaction? weird."
"had a morning flight and arrived at the cafÃ© around 10:00 am. the place was busy. lots of empty dirty tables. since the sign said to seat yourself we did but there were no clean tables so we sat at a dirty table hoping to have it cleaned soon. we sat at a table for 2 right in front of the cashier. the waitress saw us sit down and came over within about 5 minutes and asked us what we would like to order. i quizzically looked at my husband wondering if she was going to clean the table first. she was not. i looked at her and said that we just sat down and had not looked at the menu yet. could she please clean the tables. she said nothing and picked up the dirty plates, cups and utensils. she was surely annoyed i had asked. she came back again and asked what we would like. i told her i would like it if she would wipe down the table since there was clearly someone elses leftover food scraps and water rings. she again looked very annoyed and said she would. she waited 10 more minutes to come back and wipe of the table then took our order. i ordered the baked eggs but asked for no meat or cheese which apparently is in all the baked egg dishes. she looked at me and said no meat or cheese? i said that is right and she looked astounded but left. we waited 30 minutes for 2 baked eggs with coffee and croissants. meanwhile no tables were cleaned and many people, at least 5 that i counted, went to the counter as asked to have the table cleaned and several people were tired of waiting for a server. they too had to get up and ask for help. no one ever came to see if everything was okay which it was not. our egg bake was undercooked and runny at the bottom. having to catch a flight in 20 minutes we decided to just not bother getting another one."
cafe coco was the last place open late at night when we were about to catch a flig 
"i never complain, but really feel the need to today (and signed up to trip advisor for the first time). this was truly terrible food and terrible service! â¬25 for an over cooked (asked for rare got well done) thumbnail size of beef and a plate of broccoli. when i complained the waiter (cynthia) just ignored the complaint, carried on with her duties and didnât make any attempt to resolve the issue / refer it to someone more senior. never eat here !! if youâre in the airport go to burger king for a better meal and better service."
"me and a colleague sat down and ordered, breakfast and latte for me, coffee for him. been waiting for breakfast now for over 40 minutes, my colleague had to leave after 30 minutes without getting his coffee. the latte came after 10 minutes, and is passable."
"nice meal, slow service but a decent choice for a bite between flights. helps that we were there off-peak!"
"we were at schiphol waiting for a later flight and quite tired and hungry, so we chose this (lproper) restaurant, as opposed to one of the convenient cafes or self service places. the service was insanely awful, including not even bringing two of the items we ordered. the rest of the food made airline food taste marvelous -- we were served some sort of microwaved, cardboard tasting pasta with practically raw, cold vegetables on it. when i mentioned all of the problems, they removed the items we hadnt ordered from the bill, which left a still very expensive tab for absolutely rubbish food. avoid this place at all costs and either dine before you get to the airport -- or choose any other food!"
"in the past i have lunch here several times. it is not a place to be in a rush to catch the plane but to take the time and yes, service has as far as i experienced always been slow. but the food was of above average you could get at schiphol airport. last time this was unfortunately not the case. the food was horrible. no taste, no dressing in the salad, prefab? unbelievable bad and still quite expensive."
"the food is just ok, the fish which took 30 minutes to come on the table was overcook, when i asked for a side basket of break ive been ignored by the staff.  however the place is quiet with a nice view on the planes."
"a beautiful little cafe in the airport. the breakfast menu was small but i was looking forward to trying the baked eggs. it was okay, just okay. a bit flavourless and a pretty small portion. the coffee and service was good though."
"having arrived exhausted at schiphol airport to get our flight back to london heathrow, we made our way to what appeared to be a lovely quiet corner in â cafe coc "
"i was very much looking forward to spending my layover time at cafÃ© coco. it looked inviting and trendy. you could see food displayed like quiche, croissants, and numerous desserts , all temptin "
we both had a coffee here whilst waiting for a flight.  there was quite a queue - the coffee was fine but a bit expensive.
cafe coco inside the amsterdams airport was below expectations. the food quality and quantity was average.
"terrible service. ignored for ten minutes. a man pointed me out and they came five minutes after this, not concerned at all with customer service. pointed out the menu on the table (i hadnt seen it) - another 5-10 minutes passed and no one returned so i walked out, disgusted. menu looked great but attitude not worth paying money for."
"cafe coco gave me a pleasant half hours rest on a long stay in schipol. coffee ok, service ok, prices inflated - well it is in an airport!"
"croissant & cappuccino before flight. i sat at the bar, which had lots of dirty used plates, cups etc. even though staff saw the debris around me, it was not cleared. it took 10 mins to supply 1 croissatnt (with jam - which was more a sauce, gradually spreading across the plate} and a very small, medium cappuccino. i had to ask for a knife to spread the jam and spoon to stir the coffee. to be fair, watching other dishes being prepared, i think other dishes were better than my choice."
"this is a great spot for watching planes come and go, but at lunch yesterday my entree did not appear after a good long wait. i asked the waiter for my meal and she said it would be right up. another 10 minutes went by and still nothing. at that point we had to leave. our soup was ok but a very small glass of whiskey was a rip off at 12 euros."
ester the waitress swiped my credit card 8 times saying that system was down  when checked balance she charged 300 us dollars for a 25.14 transaction. this is horrible and no one will answer the phone there.
"i was looking forward to afternoon tea here after passing through schiphol on my way out. unfortunately i had a bad experience. the waiter directed me to sit at a table to be served and then he and two other colleagues served two other sets of people ahead of me, but who had arrived after me. on the second occasion, i indicated this to a waitress, who gestured to me to wait and actually said wai "
"we arrived late at the hotel and wanted some food and a drink. the axis bar had a good menu and an extensive drinks menu. the food was good and ticked the box, the atmosphere was great but it is so dark!! not very sociable!"
"unbearably slow service for a busy place. just one guy in the kitchen . cant wait 10 minutes just to have my order taken, if i have a connection to catch. no comparison to london folks! gave up in the end!"
rubbish. none of the leon breakfast muffins etc. were availanble. only porridge and some croissants and coffee. i portion of porridge and the three coffees took about 10 mins to be served.
"menu sounded amazing, delivery was not only really poor but there was merely anything in the diner box. what a joke. i took the tajine which tastes like a cheap curry. donât go there, quantity and quality are really not up to their menu offer!!!"
"the guy taking orders had no hurry, looked like he just got his two weeks notice. took forever.  very expensive for small meals, and also.. do not have salt.. at all, no jk"
"we ordered baked fries and they were very tasty. staff were friendly once they took our order. however, overall it did look very chaotic as they had a lot of staff but didnât seem to have an efficient customer centric system in place. for example, we went to the counter to order but 4 people were working on the orders taken so no one could take our order. they should have at least one person taking orders continually and not having all working on the same thing because this results in customers waiting to order. it was also result in customers feeling ignored."
know leon from london so felt it could be trusted as an airport eating place. the food filled a gap. it was healthy and organic and they seemed to fo their bit for the environment.
"i was looking to eat something simple, nice and not too unhealthy, when i passed by at leon. everything appeared nice. i ordered a chicken satay. friendly service. so, i got my food fairly quickly, too fast for fresh food. i sat down to eat. the rice was tasteless, as well as the veggies. the chicken had a weird taste en everything was covered with a tasteless spicy sauce. i just couldnât eat it all. i am curious what the ingredients are and what it was meant to be. the coke was d expected."
on the way home i thought i would take a last mea 
"i had the vegan burger âloveâ. tasty yet it could have some more salad or amenities for the price of almost 7 euro.  the fizzy drink is not recommended unless you want something with no sugar and tastes like chilli.  service is quick, and friendly."
"sauce tasted very odd in the chicken rice noodle, almost like it was missing something vital lol. the fries were so under done its actually jokes and the chicken was slimy and burnt how is thay possible. only good thing was the coca cola."
"i ate here with my bf on our way to norway. the food was uneventful and kind of sloppy, but okay its fast food. the system however does not work. you only get a ticket when you pay; not when you order. this resulted in a confused older man before us hearing halloumi and thinking this is my order, only downside, it was our order. his wife returned saying she had ordered the halloumi wrap, not the halloumi burger. i realized by that point that they had taken our order. we tried to explain it to the staff, who were confused, but after 5 minutes trying to explain it, they got i "
had dinner here before taking off. the menu has some lighter asian and north african meals which can be ordered and also served fast. had the chicken satay and it was good but would have liked a larger portion.
"it must have been a surprise to the staff that the customers at the airport needed to catch a flight. the service was appaulling, firstly i was made to wait for a few minutes while the lady behind the counter just ignored me, slowly gathering other peoples food, not acknowledging me at all. when i was served, i was refused the receipt until collection. this fast food was so slow it took 15minutes to receive my breakfast from being 3rd in line. while i was waiting, a staff member slid someones breakfast over aggressively, it fell over and she shrieked. while receiving my coffee, there was no lid available. luckily the coffee was luke warm. when i questioned about a lid, the staff member just shrugged at me. my breakfast muffin arrived and it was not a muffin, but sandwiched between two flatbreads, not what i ordered. all in all a horrible experience, and i never did receive my receipt for expenses."
"i usually want to stress the positive but i was walking through the airport the other day and saw one of these leons on the outer food court, and remembered my meal there on the way to greece two weeks earlier. this establishment does a kind of fusion cuisine but it comes off more like confusion cuisine. i had bean chilli and it was awf "
"dont go to this place. not fresh awful food has nothing in common on pictures. ordered chicken wraps and chicken mezze. we were not able even finish it. was endless waiting for my order, at the end had to go to counter to ask for it. awful servi "
"on 1st may 2019, we had lunch at fast-food outlet leon in the departure lounge at schipol airport as we had some time before our flight to naples. this restaurant together with a number of others are located on the first-floor food court. the menu was prominently displayed behind the service counter. we ordered chili chicken and falafel together with a soda. the boxed hot meals arrived quite quickly. i cannot however say that the meal was tasty. it was an average fast-food meal!"
"slowest service ever. very pleased i had a 3 hour stopover, otherwise might not have made it to front of the line"
"we arrived as schiphol earlier than usual and decided to have a coffee and âcakeâ before checking in. we selected leon. our lattes were delicious (perfect temperature) - my two portuguese natas were good, and my wife enjoyed her pain au chocolat - maar to my right another customerâs tray was filled (eg overfull), and surprise surprise a poke of chips (french fries a la leon) ended up on the floor; perhaps one member of staff did not see (but i later drew it to his attention); the other just turned his back - no replacement french fries were offered even though i drew this to the attention of the restaurant member of staff - it would have been so easy and pleasing to rectify; a completely unnecessary own goal!!!"
having saved 10â¬ specifically to sit down and enjoy some airport food i was happy seeing leon and itâs healthy options. i chose mexican beans thinking - itâs impossible to make mexican tasteless. oh how wrong i w 
"donât like writing bad reviews but the chicken i ate here was awful . very dry and hard , like it had been warmed up over and over again . literally spat it out after first taste . save your money and get something past security on airside . "
although the taste of the actual food is delicious (i had the bacon & egg muffin) the service was mediocre at most (not very friendly) and the muffin was awkward to eat as everything kept falling out. this could definitely improve. (i visited the store in the domestic departure hall.)
"of all the food choices around schiphol airport, we stuck with having leon for dinner since we know that its the healthier option over sandwiches sitting in fridges all day, and frites/kebabs fried to death around the airpo "
"obviously, after a long day serving food, quality standards can be relaxed, we can hang a little, sip our free drink when we are not serving customers, even when we are, we can be slow cleaning up dirty tables, preferably not all of them at the same time, we can forgo cleaning the floor behind the bar, we can shout, and, most of all, we can walk around with a snotty nose, snorting and rubbing mucus across servings. am i exaggerating? nope. this is leon schiphol plaza at 19:30. the avocado and halloumi burger was soggy and squishy, the peas salad was kind of tasty though, as well as the fries. the goji berry water however was some kind of artificial, sugary horror. 16 eur was well over the top for quality delivered. next time ill go for bk across the isle and screw vegetarianism."
"surprised to see higher ratings on this place than expected. the cost is high, the proportions are tiny and the food is bland. looked good from the outside but seriously disappointing."
ordered the thai green curry chicken which came with brown rice and some salad. was disappointed with the serving size and the taste of the curry was just mediocre and a few miserable looking slices of chicken. not appetizi 
"were there on saturday morning june 16th around 10:30 am. there was a girl standing close to the coffe machine. i asked if i could get warm water to make baby milk. she answered that shes too bussy for it, directly looked to another direction and left. she was very rude. there were not more than 3 people waiting in the line and there were queueing for their order being taken by her colleague. i didnt expect michelin star restaurant attitude but she could told me to buy warm water if it isnt allow by the company, which are never happened in the netherlands. very disappointed. dont go there if youre in hurry, with elderly or children."
was excited to find a healthy restaurant in the airport...was quickly disappointed. paid $12 for a grilled chicken burger & fries. could not even bite into the chicken it was so gross. very dark and almost smoked and felt like rubber when i tried to take a bite. fries were hard and cold. threw the whole thing away because i wasnât sure if it was appropriate to send food back in the netherlands.
"ordered the morrocan meatballs for take away and once i opened it, it turned out they forgot to give me half of the meal: no salad, no fresh herbs.. just boring rice, meatballs and some tomato sauce. for 9 euro! i complained at their customer service and they will try to find a solution. perhaps the taste is better when you got to taste the full meal as it supposed to be.."
very smal portion of chicken (maiby 50 gr) in a hot box chicken for just under 8 euro. the few chicken pieces were very dry. really poor food.  ð
"being stuck in an airport we thought this might be a good meal choice, whilst the falafel box was okay the chips were pretty awful. chewy and tasteless, i suppose i should have complained to the staff but being at an airport and grabbing food before we fly it didnt think of it. the layout of the place is also a bit difficult if you have luggage, the tables are fixed and space is restricted."
"omg, this is by far one of the worst fast casual dining experiencr ever. you can fool maybe a lot of people but not me. this is nothing green and healty about this place. its a scam and nothing is fresh. not even the salad."
"its a charming little place with fast service and friendly staff. the food was tasty however, it was a messy experience. i had the sausage and egg on a burger bun but the bun was very soggy because it had too much sauce so the food kept sliding out. it is not a particular cheap place to have breakfas "
we have just had our breakfast at leon and it was dreadful at best. the sausages were powdery and the skins chewy. really strange flavour too. the hash brown bite were just lumps of soggy grated potato and the coffee was cold. we had to wait a long for what i suspect was food that had been pre-cooked the night before and microwaved this morning. as a frequent business traveller from schiphol i can say that this was my last visit. 
had the lemon chicken with rice at nearly eur 9. comes with salat. all nicely prepared however not any taste in the food.
i had the vegan super quinoa salad which was very fresh and tasty but the portion was really small. my friend had the chicken aioli wrap which had barely any aioli in it.
had the meatball burger and fries. bit weird but pretty nice for airport food. place could do with a bit of a clean. floors quite dirty. not great but have had a lot worse in airports over the years.
"chicken & chorizo hot box with chicken chilli...... half portion of luke warm rice, 4 small pieces of over-microwaved chicken thigh meat with a spatter of red chilli oil and a bit of shredded cabbage - â¬8.95. possibly the worst meal ever tasted. what made it even worse was the number of customers that were served after me but got their food before me. by the time mine was ready my hot water had cooled so much it wouldnt brew the teaba "
"my last 2 visits have been awful with slow service, few seats and over cooked food - see the photo of the dry, burned chicken below. if you love leon in london avoid this place."

situated at schiphol plaza which is a messy mini shopping mall at the arrivals section of amsterdam schiphol airport. even with so many shops schiphol airport still lacks good eating options. leon is a newly opened restaurant right next to the always busy burger king. it is situated between arrivals 1-2 and arrivals 3- 
"i tend to get my breakfast from leon when im working nightshifts. they offer tasty food and great coffee. they are expenisive, though."
"we visited leon at schiphol airport before take-off for our summer holiday, since both of us were not that hungry and there was a long line for the burger king we decided to have the chicken burger at leon for the value of about 8â¬ a piece. of course this price sets a certain quality expectation, especially with the competition (on burgers) right next door. after unwrapping the leon chicken burger you realize that the quality expectation that you had while paying the bill, needs adjusting downwards. it is a simple white bun (from the supermarket which sell for 0,80â¬ per 10 pieces) with some chicken and 1 or 2 slices of cucumber and tomato. after the first bite we knew why the line at leon was close to zero and the line for burger king was about 60 people, since the both of us nearly turned green after that bite. the chicken tastes horrible, we tossed the burgers in the bin and went for a burger at burger king. (where you can have a complete menu for the price of one lousy, horrible tasting, cheap looking burger at leon by the way). since we will never even consider returning to leon, this was a once in a lifetime experience for us. "
i had a lamb kofte box. the taste was ok but nothing special. the food comes in a box without compartments which is whyby the time you get to the table it is mixed up somewhat ( i do eat with my eyes). i noticed they also have vegetarian dishes and i must say service was fa 
"the food seemed to be made with fresh ingredients and had good flavour, but the burgers are quite small for 7â¬. better than average."
"just had a egg and sausage muffin and a mocha. the girl at the counter was very friendly! thats why the 3 stars! it starts with a smile. but the products...... that doesnt bring me a smile. the muffin is just a wholeweat bun and its dry! the sausage is bland and the skin is really chewy. the drop of sauce is tomato but tasteless too. the egg overcooked. the mocha is coffee with instant chocolate powder which isnt dissolved yet, so coffee with clumps in it. sad :-("
the food is not bad but we can expect better when we see the restaurant. there is hardly enough food in the box a little more would be great. i took a box with chicken ( not the best part of the chicken ) and a lemonade that was good. friendly staff. do nlt hesitate to eat in another restaurant id you ca 
"a relatively new place at schiphol airport, focussing on all natural burgers etc (interestingly located next to the bk schiphol). i ordered a chicken burger with fries. in all honesty, i wasnt really impressed. the chicken fillet was a little flat in taste, and the fries we soft. should i have complained, probably yes, did not have the time. will go back as probably i just was not lucky this time."

"treated a family that have recently moved to the netherlands. we have had meals here in the past so were confident that we would have a good experience. sadly not - meal ruined by poor service. our original booking was lost, so had to wait while tables were pulled together. drinks orders were lost, chilled wine in cooler unpoured during the meal, had to prompt for dessert menus. tap water refused except for one person - no table iced water, so had to buy a bottle of evian.had to chase for the bill, by this stage i refused to leave a tip. not clear who was in charge, and staff did not seem to want to be there, doing their best to ignore us. poorly led and poorly trained. the food itself was good, beautifully cooked and well presented. the bill for the 6 of us, just shy of e500."
two stars for the lovely two ladies with black glowing hair. they were the best in their job but sadly the cooks must be having a bad evening as i did not find seafood or salad dressing without any flavor. expensive.
"unfortunately, i canât tell you if the food was good or not. we walked in, they told us to take a seat and the waiter would be with us in a minute.the waiter never came over. we gave a sign twice for them yo drop by our table but they ignored it. looked at me in my face, never came and attended other people that walked in after us. i am bi-racial and i must say, i have never felt so discriminated in my life:("

when you are staying in an airport hotel you tend to lower your expectations. but this was beyond that. when we asked why our meal was taking so long we were told the kitchen was âclosedâ - overwhelmed with âtickets â. in the end the food was mediocre and would have been badly overpriced had not the captain adjusted the bi

"we had a business dinner here while staying at the hotel. the food was pretty good for an airport hotel, but the service was extremely slow. they appeared to not have enough staff and were quite busy. i did have breakfast here three days and the food was good. it is a buffet with many choices of foods."
"wow.... this place is expensive; really expensive. i wanted something real to eat before i would get on my trip. it is in the sheraton hotel. i did expect it to be decent, and organised. i would have expected to be paying too much. it is schiphol after all. but this is completely out of wack. wine 6 times the price you pay in the shop (i accept 3). service is amateurish (at best). cooking, as you expect... for that kind of money... i will not go again"
"i have eaten here twice and each time felt somewhat disappointed. i had a veal that was tasteless, as were the sides. the caesar salad was so so. really not worth the price, but better than eating at the airport i suppose."
i went to this restaurant with high expectations that i was in for a culinary treat. from the way the menu was laid out to the side sauces and rubs it filled with anticipati 
"had two meals in the stripes restaurant in the sheraton amsterdam airport hotel. first was dinner in the bar area. service was average or below. food was ok; appetizers were better than main course. for breakfast there is a buffet which was very nice; good selection of fruits, eggs and meats. service at breakfast was much better."
"buffet was okay, a lot of items needed to be refreshed,  very few yogurts to choose from. the restaurant is much better then the club lounge, if you have a choice!"
stopped by here after a long work-day.  had to sit at the bar for about 10 minutes before getting served even though there were servers just standing near-by.  only had a snack and the food was ok.  drink selection is typical for amsterdam.
"this is a good looking but typical âin-hotelâ restaurant. the menu is well worked through with a good selection of food and wine, and food is tasty (we had both fish and meat). the downside is the slow and distracted service staff....the head waiter is friendly and alert, but the rest of the staff are very slow, forget orders and seems in general distracted by their own dreams... improvement potential!"
this is the restaurant of the sheraton and honestly there is nothing special about  
cold and tasteless food. terrible service. staff apparently untrained. no visible management. probably better to eat in the airport.
okay the food was excellent (except the trifle for dessert) but theyâre really pushing it with the prices. i ordered the recommended 3-course meal and had 2 glasses of wine. the damage? $100 - and thatâs without the tip .. the service was great and deserved one. anyway i would try somewhere else next time i need dinner near schiphol.
"bitterbal of veal with polenta, green peas, black garlic jus and apple compote was very tasty. but 32,50 euros for it was far too much. service was quick and casual."
"stripes at the sheraton is elegant and convenient. service of the friendly staff is very good. it is not cheap to eat here and though it has everything to make this a nice fine dining experience the food comes up short. i was pleased with the duck appetizer but both my wifes sirloin as well as my filet mignon came up short, lacking the tenderness you should expect for an expensive piece of meat. the side orders of potato and wild mushrooms are huge ,enough for two people ."
the atmosphere was nice put the food was bland. the mashed potatoes were pre-prepared and served in slices with a day old taste. a very poor value.
"obviously, the place you go to for meals if you stay at sheraton schiphol. the location is convenient, the appointments are in place, and the ambiance is generally pleasa "
"just refused the business menu main course after smelling it and tasting a small bite. after the soup (not so nice or fresh asparagus) we received really bad smelling cod fish. it was rotten! i travel a lot and often stayed in the sheraton but this was terrible! already feeling bad, i hope not to get sick from this! an absolute bad experience "

"airport was busy and this place looked a little quieter. put my order in (chicken satay and glass of wine). after an age i checked on my order, my wine hadnt been put through and the food would be a while. eventually wine turned up. an age later my food arrived after being offered to two other tables. wish it hadnt served better looking food to my dog. was some talk of a free wine but as i write the head waitress is arguing against this. unbelievable really, avoid"
"***avoid this restaurant*** went 01/12 with a few friends. ordered two satay chicken mains and 2 of their hamburgers and some nachos. absolutely awful... chicken satay sauce was a thick disgusting mess with chewy chicken and the wedges seemed like that had been sat for a while as some were solid and others barely warm. the burger were equally as bad, way too overloaded with sauce to make up for the dry beef burger and wedges on them were again bad. the nachos had a enough cheese to cause a small heart attack making them into a solid block which was difficult to eat. very expensive and waitresses didnât seem at all interested with how the food was. ***avoid this restaurant***"
standard place to eat something at schippol airpo 
"crossroads is a good place to visit after waiting for someone at the arrival hall in schiphol. we had some tea and the famous dutch bitterballen. however, these were not fried in oil but warmed in an oven (afterward we saw that the menu said oven bitterballen so we should have known). they were warm and still soft, and two of them were even to cold to eat. a big disappointment. the tea was nice and hot though."
"a party of 9 of us tried to eat here.... the meals all came at different times, all food was cold, but 2 were too cold to be acceptable and were sent back. we also found plastic in one of the meals! we tried to speak to the manager about it but she was very rude. never had a worse meal/service!"

"while a good place for a beer, the food was poor. my burger, which was passable, came with a serving of wedges (listed as french fries on the menu), while my wife had a steak (tough) served with some frozen vegetables that were luke warm and looked unappetising. the service was efficient and reasonably friendly. would look at other options next time."
"one star is even too much .i was waiting there for 10 minutes to be attended but none of the staff came . they were busy chit chatting with each other. i reached the counter to place the order. girls standing there didnât even greet. they ask me â what you want to haveâ in a rude tone. another one rolled her eyes . service was pathetic . they serve the food as if they are doing a favor. most of the time i have seen them looking at customers, whispering to each other and laughing at them . i work in service industry and i understand the body language very well. i ll not suggest this restaurant to anyone . i did find them racist. white people were served first and they look down on other nationalities. i have noticed a staff member was talking to his friend ( was not the restaurant employee)for 15 minutes and i think she gave him some free food while customers who were waiting to pay and eat was ignored.restaurant authorities you can check your cameras. your staff is horrible. if they were working in my company they would have got terminated because rudeness and racism is not tolerated at all."

crossroads is a good place to wait for arriving passengers in the arrival 2 hall. it is next to the arriving passengers and nicer setup while you donât how long you wait is going to be. other than that itâs a regular cafe not to be remembered afterwards.
"very soggy and burned chips, hardly eatable, neater one of us finished their fries. you better go to mc donalds or burger king."
"after waiting for our luggage that was not coming because of hanging in the airport of toronto, we really needed to have lunch and we went to this (new) restaurant. we ordered chips (pommes frites) and it was quick service. you can see that the frites are slices unpeeled potatoes and it tasted oke, only its too dark. they have already fried it and put it back above the frying pan. yes, it would be very handy and quick work for them when its crowded but in fact theyre frying it two times, thats why it was too dark and there was a lot of small dark hard pieces. the mayonaise was good and the price is oke. the staffs were busy talking to each other and one of them were eating his wrap and we saw the other, once a while put something into the mouth. it could be better."
"hi, we stopped here for lunch when we arrived at the airport from montreal. we had a little time on our hands so the thought sounded good. wow, a nice busy airport with lots to do and gather some information on ground transportation and schedules. so we had a kebab, burger and fries. all were served rapidly and hot. it was fine for fast food and an airport meal. there are also other fine choices like the seafood kiosk not too far."
"had fries here once we got out of departures for a quick snack, and also on our last night in amsterd "
we were hungry and it was convenient.  wasnt terrible and it wasnt great.  the staff were not overly friendly / helpful - possibly the language barrier.
read about the place so took the opp to visit the place since we were in amsterdam airport. service was fast so thats good. 7euro for a medium bag of fries with ketchup and mayo is not exactly value for money. i would suggest you give this place a miss try the pizza restaraunt next door. we tried it later and preferred that for sure.
"i got a small fries, and they were cold. i ask for hot ones. they were happy to give me a new serving, but that one was a mix of older stale friea with fresher ones. not cool."

we had a dreadful experience at mcdonaldâs in the airport. food was freezing cold and when we brought it back they laughed at us. disgraceful experience altogether. even management was not helpful. stay away
waited for ages to be seated with staff actively ignoring us. extremely rude when spoken to. do not go here if you want a nice meal.
"waited for ages at the door to be seated with members of staff walking to and fro past us with no acknowledgement. eventually got a table sat next to 2 other guests, which was a bit odd, but we were grateful for a seat. we were completely ignored after this and had to ask at the bar if we could order food and drinks. our drinks arrived - food was left on the pass for a long time while disorganised members of staff flitted about or stood chatting. our food arrived and the waitress left, i presumed for cutlery but i was wrong. i had to go to the kitchen area to ask for a knife and fork. choice of food on the menu is poor and the food wasnt great but was let down by every other part of the experience. had to ask to pay the bill - over 50 euro for pasta, a burger, a medium beer and a coke."
went in this cafÃ© for breakfast before my fligh 
"first of all i really do think this restaurant is in violation of eu policy with no mention of allergens in the menu and no information about this when asked. waiter had to check each individual dish with the kitchen. making rhings worse the steak was watery, weak, and seemed microwaved. absolutely not somewhere to eat. the frites was fairly nice though. "
"i decided to skip burger king for het palais! a big mistake as i had the experience of the worst hamburger ever! the meat taste bad and us obviously some industrial chemical cook up! this was a true art of incompetence by this rather nice lookng place.avoid the food, unless you are through a half bottle of vodka at the bar!"
"unwelcoming, unfriendly, rude staff. we were on transit and wanted to sit for coffee on a very busy day at schipol airport, one table was available but without chair, so the waiter told us that we must sit at the bar since this table had no chair. another customer gently offered us a chair that we took to sit at the table. the waiter comes yelling at us that we did not follow his instructions and that we must sit at the bar again although we managed to find a chair. poor sense of hospitality, no proactiveness, 0 customer service!"
the staff is everything but friendly especially the old bold man. i am happy that i didnât spend my money at that place. please do yourself a favor and start your holiday somewhere else.

"on the 24th of june at around 19-00, my father, had an unfortunate experience of being subjected to rude behavior by an employee of het paleis bar in terminal 1. the waiter in question without provocation used inappropriate, racially motivated words on my father. i am attaching the photo of the employee in question. please go to another bar if you read this."
"very standard dish, chicken satay, looked like cooked some hours ago and pre-fab. prawn crackers probably made yesterday. fries are better in every other place in the benelux. and this eur 25. my mistake for being hungry and optimistic."
"i was told the food would be 30 minutes, after 1 hour and 15 minutes there was still no sign of my food. however, two tables next to me who came after me had been served their meals. when i asked what was happening i was told there was a mistake in the kitchen and my food would be another 15 minutes. when my food finally did arrive (chicken satay and chips), it was bland and only slightly warm. there was no apology for the delay. when i asked to pay i was ignored and had to ask 3 times. itâs like the staff donât realise they are working in an airport and people might have somewhere to be. the chicken satay and gin & tonic cost 35â¬ and there wasnât even a garnish with the gin. pathetic. wish i had gone to burger king! donât be fooled by the nice exterior, this place isnât worth the price or the wait."
"waiting to get seated just got too tiresome, as staff continued to ignore us.. we were directed to the restaurant when the cafe had closed the kitchen at 20.00. for now, not recommendable."
"slow and uninspired service, and gas station level burger. i regret not going to burger king instead. we had to wait for the bill a long time, and then had to get up from the table and pay at the desk to get out. at the same time people were queuing to get inside."
"what an awful place. i came here today with my partner, saw they sold a meatless burger, double checked with the waitress that it was vegan - she assured me it was and told us to take a table. after a short wait we were greeted by a different waiter, so being careful as always i asked him to confirm it was vegan which he did, but then on being asked about the mayonnaise, he responded well i dont know if its vegan or not... so i asked him if they could veganize it and after briefly checking with the chef he confirmed it was not vegan but vegetarian. okay. can you please tell me the vegan options? i asked him, only to be told that this restaurant does not cater for vegan "
"very small menu, great service and a perfect place to have a beer and a hamburger meanwhile you wait at the airport. iâve visited twice when connecting flights."
"the restaurant looks nice from outside, thats why we choose it. but the food and drink selection was a disappointment. they couldnt provide a slice of gluten free bread, or any  milk alternative , or even a cup of decaff coffee for our breakfast."
"went here for lunch and ordered the club sandwich without tomato. when i got the sandwich i could straight away spot a massive tomato glaring at me. i told the waiter, who apologized and took it back. she then came back 2 minutes later with what was obviously the same sandwich. on the crust there was gooey tomatoseeds and i found two pieces of tomato still within the sandwich. told the other waiter about it when she asked how everything was. she said she would talk to the waiter in question.. aaand proceeded to never return to our table. we eventually paid at the counter. no discount, no nothing. my gfs 18 euro pasta was mall cafe quality at best (which, to be fair, is expectable at an airport). left the place annoyed and unsatisfied. would not recommend"
how a great international airport can accept such a terribel restaurants is beyond my understanding. its been there for a long time and its just getting wor 
not very good service considering you are on a time limit at the airport. took 15 minutes before anyone took our order.  would not recommend if you do not have much time at the airport
"lunch time in schiphol and where to go? fast- or slow food? slow this time. seems pretty average after all, and since its inside the transit area they can, more or less, charge whatever they want, following the international airport codex of pricing, meaning hi "
"the staff seemed too careless about covid.  for example one server wasnât wearing a mask, my table wasnt cleaned even when i asked, and the staff did not look like they were cleaning their hands."
i went in yesterday and we were seated at a table outside and was informed that all services had to be done via the qr code set at the table. this in itself isnt a proble 
good location for a coffee or to grap something to drink  the coffee is quite okay. the offered food is nothing special.
we have come here for several years and earlier it has been ok and a tradition. this time it was awfull. prefabricated burger beef. far worse than mcdonalds. end of tradition. never again!
we are here while waiting for a transfer flig 
busy restaurant where you can sit for a couple of hours while you eat despite reading reviews about poor service it was very good and ive got no complaints. if you wait 2 hours then you need to be more assertive to get attention......youre only one amongst lots. and before you complain try doing the job yourself......and are you always perfect at what you do...all d 
"this was the worst service i have ever received in a restaurant. if the food had been decent, the service would have been bad enough, but unfortunately the food was bad, too. over cooked, dry salmon, pumpkin soup that tasted âoffâ like it came from a can, a strange white sauce poured heavily over the green beans, and more. "
"because of the klm caterer strike, we ended up having breakfast at this restaurant and the hot croissant with ham and cheese was perfect. the coffee was also very good."
"my review does not refer to the food or value of this establishment, but has i feel, important things to reco "
"for a sit down airport restaurant, the service goes beyond poor. we had to fight to place an order, and it was impossible to pay a bill â the staff not only refused, but was not willing to find the right person. there were at least six of us competing to get the serverâs attentio "
waited for two hours before waiter said that the kitchen had cancelled our order. meanwhile other people came in and got served the same thing that we order 
"...this is the place to go.  we had burgers, fries and a salad. all ânice and coldâ.  service was hard to get hold off, not very knowledgeable about what they are serving and probably not giving a damn anyway."
"we ordered 2 beer and hamburgers waiting for our next flight and it took about 45 minutes for them to first come with one hamburger, then 15 minutes later the second hamburger. still no beer. i told the waitress for the first time about us still not having drinks - we waited a while, nothing happened. i asked another waiter about the drinks, waited. nothing. when we were nearly done with the hamburgers i went upp to them again, and then at last we got 2 beer. in the end noone came even near us, so that we could ask for the bill. had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the 50 euro for everything. "
the service was bad! we waited a really long time to get service and it ended with us searching for a waitress. the staff had a bad attitud and was not serviceminded. when we got our drinks our soda had no gas at all. the table was not clean or cle 
i had to wait 20 minutes until we were served and then had to wait another 20 minutes for it be deliver 
id rather drink here than in the alternative at schipol. they have decent beer and traditional dutch food. its always been quite relaxed. the service here is much more friendly than other airport bars i have visited: staff smile and seem motivated to provide helpful service.
we thought we come here because it was more expensive and youâd expect better service - wrong! i had to go and ask for assistance and was impolitely told to go back to my seat and wait!
"what can i say: when you want to have a meal at the airport, usually you are quite* in a hurry. this place is totally disorganised, no sense of customer service. we ordered the burger and a chicken sandwich. although the drinks were served immediately we had to threaten to leave after 30 minutes, the only answer that the waiter gave was that everyone was complaining ..it took another 10 or 15 minutes to get our food..since we were close to the kitchen we could see that our food was ready for a while already when the waitress picked it u "
"i was here on two different occasions, and have two very different opinion "
"this restaurant is horrible. this is the first time i stomped out of a restaurant as it has such horrible services. they want us to look for an empty table on our own.. and all tables were apparently reserved. my point is.. if you do not have the capacity or resources, dont expect your customers to be scavenging around for an empty table that can be used. also, before we went into the restaurant, there is this waiter who gave us a racist look. yes we are asians. whats your problem??? stop being racist, move  "
impolite and indifferent waiters. i was waiting for 30 min and was not possible to even order. really very bad behavior.
total lack of understanding of what service means. also i am not too sure the staff realize that they are working on an airport and that people need to take plan 
"the quiche (with spinach) was quite good actually, and there was plenty of parmazan cheese and dressing on the side salad....but i fail to understand why the dressing was on the bottom of the plate and not over the sal "
staff were really rude and didnât seem bothered about giving them 100+ euros. was waiting 15 minutes to be served and had to ask for a menu followed by waiting another 20 minutes until the waiter didnât even bother to come and take our order! quite terrible service 
"so, ive been sitting for the las 15 on one of the outside tables waiting for someone to come. as i could see the waiters were busy i went inside and wanted to place the order myself. the barman sent me back to my table kindly letting me know that (quote) we have table service (unquote). so we are leaving. let the barman know my displeasure in no uncertain terms and i didnt get a single word in retur "
total chaos. took forever to take our order. then took forever to deliver the meal. after 40 minutes suddenly they realized the meal we ordered was no longer on stock. waited a further 30 minutes to get another choice. terrible.
well the burger was ok but the fries cold and the service personal is more interested in their mobile phones than serving the guests. toke 10 minutes to get the bill and pay
"thought to go for a quick bite. ordered a salad and waited for more than 20 min. then they came back that they ran out of salad! ordered something else and they promised to speed it up. after another 25 min still nothing ! asked one the ladies who were serving to check, no feedback at all. went again to another waitress and they forgot again my orde "
this restaurant is located between terminals so it is convenient to pause here if you are going to fly outside of eu. we (like almost everybody else) ordered their classic burgers and beer combo. food was absolutely ok and price level as expecte 
"10 minutes is how long i waited befora i left. i was sitting 5 meters from the bar, but the 5(!) waiters were to busy talking to eachother, so nobody came to get my order."
"from the outside this cafe looks nice and cosy. however, you are in for quite an experience from start to finish, if you get in. they want you to wait at the entrance for seating, which makes sense, but apparently no one is assigned to seating, so you can wait forever before you get the attention of staff. once seated it is another trick to again get the attention of staff to order, and once this has been achieved food takes a while to arrive. the menu is ok, but nothing spectacular. having finished your meal you will again have to work miracles to get the attention of staff to pay, and if you are paying by credit card you will be asked to go to the bar counter anyway, so you might as well make your way there to start with, and see if you can get the attention of anyone there. all in all not a good experience, and a little sad, as the location and atmosphere could make this a great experience with a little coordination and enhanced service from staff."
"the service is really shockingly slow and poor. i waited for 30 minutes to place my order. drinks never arrived. food arrived about 30 minutes later. nearly missed my flight on a 90 minute connection. food was passable, but not great - not good enough for the pain of the service. i travel through schiphol a lot, but will never go back. "
i was waiting more than 30 min before a waiter came to me for taking the order. at an airport where the people are in hurry before the have their flight this is a no- 
"i visited on a monday around 1:00 pm. while it was a little busy, there were pleanty empty seats in the house. i sat at a table that needed to be cleaned off from previous customer. perhaps they cleaned it after i left, but they sure did not while i was ther "
"very unpolite and unprofessional service. discussion mutually, being unpolite when serving. i will never come near this place."
two years ago they served ok food. now the best they serve is x-tra cold heinek 
"they tried to cheat with the wine . we ordered a bottle of wine which they brought already opened and explained how that was normal course . after we insisted they quickly exchanged for an unopened wine which was still overpriced ( 12 eur retail vs 65 at the restaurant ) . the burgers were with frozen beef, the chicken caesar was with smoked precooked supermarket chicken . this place is fully unacceptable for the standard of amsterdam airport . "
"waiting 45 minutes for serving. everytime we approach the staff, they say please wait a minute ill be right with you."
i have written quite some reviews of this place. that is because i return here once a while since i travel a lot from this airport. review score varied in the past with a single uplift once where i had the impression management paid notice of my suggestio 
"45min waitingtime. two of us got their food, the third burger was forgotten and i had to order something else. disaster!"
"airport restaurant only has one main goal: be fast. most of the people cannot wait 40 minutes to be seated when you have 20 free tables and 50 minutes for a salad. great job, you did it."
"a complete horror show. staff were clueless, ignorant and not interested.  shambles of a place. every customer was very frustrated. avoid. i feel sick....."
"the only place that comes close to this restaurant in originality is probably murphys, still het paleis has been an icon of the departures area since 2004. its a scaled down replica of samuel sarphatis 1950s palace for folk art. decor is art deco with lots of wood, cast iron and a gigantic brewers kettle up on the first floor. coke goes for â¬ 3,50, beer for 5, soup 8,50 and a plate of food around 20. when i visited last, service was quite ok, even if the place was packed."
we usually eat at het paleis when we travel from schiphol and the food is pretty decen 
"it seems that i was not the first. went to the bar counter and stood there for 5mins waiting to be served, with 5 staff members inside and around the bar. decide to face one of them, who told me that i could not be served at the bar (after 3 persons took their drinks, seating around the bar counter). i have asked to talk with the manager, all of them answered, âthere are no managerâ. asked for the complaint book, there was no book either. this people just doesnât care, people are just keep coming in. my complaint will follow to the netherlands and airport authorities. concerning the ones reading this review... good luck!"
pretty good restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and very nice service.i like it and i keep going .
"the staff are not interested in doing their job. we had to find the menus ourselves, and left after 30 minutes without them even taking our order."
"i had a nice asian chicken, but the waitor was not so interested in his customers. perhaps a how to treat your customer-workshop would be useful...?!"
thought this place looked quite nice from the outside but should have realised it was a shocker when i saw filthy tables and staff just wandering by the queue of people at the doo 
"been here several times. interiÃ¶r a mixturen between belle epoque and an irish pub. usually quite fast service, however oftentimes (as most service personer on schiphol) indifferent. food ok bit nothing more."
"we wanted to have meal at a restaurant at schiphol with real table service, which is not very easy to find. the place at first sight looks inviting, and so does the menu, but as has already been mentioned by previous reviewers, service is pretty bad. it took ages for someone to notice us, the waitresses were less than pro-active and more interested in chatting to each other than serving customers. the food in itself was fine, as were the drinks, but overpriced. better management of staff is strongly advised, but as all the catering options at schiphol are run by the same company and therefore monopolised, there is probably little motivation to improve."
"youll be deluded. even in non-peak hours theyll let you down. slow, unfriendly service and delusional food (untrue to description)."
"the black coffee was fine and the espresso was not the best, a bit acidic. the seating was fine, less crowded as at starbucks. friendly staff."
"the bread was far to hard to cut through with the butter knife. tasteless and no gravy or sauce in the burger. ketchup and mayo was presented next to the plate, then you had to build your burger yourse "
my flight with klm got delayed and i received on the klm app one voucher of 10 euros value. i picked some snacks and when i showed the app voucher on my phone they did not accept unless it was paper printed. i left the stuff there. 28.02.2018 16:14
this is not meat ! mcdonalds is better !!  french fries not good either.   only the beer is ok.  far too expensive for what it is.   nice situation thats all...
"this place is very strange. you wait forever for service, but some people are evidently fine with that. the staff are quite abrupt when they do finally notice you, and they are not particularly rushed. looking around though you feel that you might be the only person with a flight to catch, as plenty of people are smiling, drinking and chatti "

"the service and food was so bad, i downloaded tripadvisor, created a new account and made my first comment here just so i can tell you all how bad this place i "
"not a good choice. they were very busy, so i felt like i am annoying them with my questions. long waiting time for baverege, but fast food delivery. the burger i had was good teste except for being totatally killed by overcooking... will not go again"
"early bfst when going on a family vacation?? 6,95â¬ for a simple take away sandwich!!!! absolutely unaccepatable"
the service here could be significantly better here. so could the food. at best it is boring snacks - nothing more  on the positive side the het paleis is placed centrally in schiphol airport.
"pricey place, found a hair in my food, pointed it out to waitress who took my plate away and never returned with an explanation. later went to pay and they charged the full amount saying the hair i found was from an artichoke even though no artichoke was on the plate. best to avoid. "
"sandwiches and coffee before boarding a flight. 45 euro for 4 sandwiches and 4 drinks .. is overpriced, especially if the coffee is not good. went to neighbor starbucks for a good dopio afterwards."
been here twice or three time on business transfers. ( not always my choice). the food is quite alright. i had the dutch burger (without bread...coeliac). they were happy to modify the meal for my gluten requirements so that is ni 
"nice service, food is ok (we had some snacks before our flight), drinks ok (a standard dutch pub measure.) beers fresh from the barrel. but prices are a real rip-off. for a ketel1, where you pay in a normal pub between 2 and 3 euro, 8.50 was charged. for the dutch delecacy bitterballen we paid 7 euro for a portion of six whilst in normal pubs you pay between 4 and 5 euro. a 3 for the pub but a 1 for the rip-off"
"we were changing planes in amsterdam and have used this place before. the food and service were always good. we arrived there with around 55 minutes before having to go to the gate for the next plane, ordered soup and sandwiches and a couple of beer "
"people working here really hate their job. if not, they do a good job of acting. donât be surprised to be forever waiting at your table because waiter will never look at you. you need to âgrabâ a waiter for servic "
"we came here for a cappuccino and were sitting outside. after some time without service we went inside to order and the staff was very rude. one waiter told us to order at the bar and at the bar they told us to order at the waiter. the waiter thenbtold us he would make a round through the bar and would serve us very last. finally after 30+ minutes another waiter served the cappuccino by almost throwing them on the table. very bad service, do not go here. horrible place!"
"airport restaurants are airport restaurants. so we dont use them with great expectations. but this one nearly drove us insane with the service. we had to remind our drinks four times, and kindly so. in return we had rude attitude instead of an apology. i urge the owners to train their staff about the basics of etiquette if hey want to keep charging the prices they do."
airport cafes are airport cafes. very seldom a place you return to me. this is no exception: i will not return. overpriced caesar salad and a sloppy served white beer. service quite nonchalant.
"this is one of the best places to eat. you can read my many reviews as i am a frequent guest. the only problem most of the staff suffer from is arrogance and lack of real customer service. the typical waiter looks away from anyone so you need to stand up and get attention if you want to order. typical unfriendly posture, hating the job or simply no education in hospitality at all. i have been here over 20 times now and must say this is the core problem of the staff; no hospitality. they are there to make their hours and unluckily serve you when they feel like it. nothing wrong with the food; just with the people serving  "
"i was recently departing schiphol and wanted to try a new restaurant, and when i walked past the striking two-story building-within-a-building of the grand cafe het paleis, i thought it would be a good choice. after nearly a 10-minute wait to be seated, i was ushered to a dirty table by a server who promptly disappeared. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and, when i asked politely, gave me a menu. i ordered a eur 6 belgian trippel and the dutch burger, a 180g beef patty with gouda and bacon. although the menu doesnt mention it, the burger comes with fries. the food arrived in about 15 minutes and was delicious. once i finished eating, i waited another 15 minutes or so for my check. the food was quite good, and the hardwood, glass, and brass decor of the bar is pleasant to look at. however, the service was slow even by european standards, so i wont be going back."
really slow service. we had to wait for 20 min for two salads. the tables were not cleaned and the service looked really unhappy with their job. not coming back.
"food was ok but we had to wait 15 minutes and call 4 times the waiters to order our meal. actually i had to go myself to call one of them to fibally get attention. even after the order they left the table dirty from previous customers and i asked one of the waiters to clean it up. no follow up, so i asked again another one who answer that she did not have anything to use to clean it and it was not her job and suggested me to ask another one. therefore for the second time i had to get up and go asking to clean the table. when they finally delivered the food the table was still dirty and the waiter started putting down our plates on the dirty table. i told him i would not have eaten my food on a disgusting table with glasses and food from previous customers and after another careless comment and simile from the waiter, he finally cleaned it "
it was not that busy and apparently they couldnt accept more people in the restaurant! i find that really disappointing since it is the only real restaurant to eat at schiphol... maybe we could try next time.
"went there for dinner. many tables free, but no one care to clean them. no waitres no hostess to guide you to a table. when asking where to sit; choose any table  but the case was no clean tables. aprroaching the staff was disappointin "
in an airport the restaurants should be very quick and understand deadlin 
"been there for breakfast. ordered  small paris breakfast  , that includes a glass of juice, croissant with marmalade, butter and jam, but no coffee . felt myself fooled with breakfast that doesnt include coffee and need to order as extra, that makes the small parisian breakfast quite overprice "
"i used to go there every time i had to go to amsterdam. it has changed, though. and, i must say that it has been for wor "
"beautifully decorated buzzy place, after 10 minutes you forget you are actually at the airport.  after 30 minutes (with no food) the thought of catching a flight comes back to your mind.  after 45 mins you want to fly home.  shame"
"looking at the same menu as 10 years back, there is a limit to how many times you think chicken satay is exciting. but really there is a huge lack of good dining options at schiphol."
"according to the airport information desk, this is the only sit-down restaurant in the main terminal of the airport.  it was not overly cramped, the food was pretty good, and the price was acceptable by airport menu standards."
i was there looking for a lunch when i was waiting for my transit flight back to hk. my husband and i walked in the restaurant a waitress asked 
queues too long for average food and snotty waitresses who think they are goddesses who have the power of life and death
"busy place in the heart of ams airport, where i usually have dinner before flying back home with a late flight. staf is really welcoming, and there is a variety of meals for you to chose from, from light finger foods to full size burgers."
"i wanted to go to a proper restaurant in the amsterdam airport so i came across this one that looked decent. i ordered the spicy coconut soup, along with bread. oh my! the soup was very cold when it arrived. and the spice level was non existent! it should not be advertised as spicy when there is honestly no spice whatsoever. i was actually confused about thi "
"good service, quick and friendly. good standard pretty good for an airport . as always for captive audience pretty pricey, but if the food is ok you dont mind too much. this restaurant fits purpose and as better than most."
"supposedly table service, dont be fooled. ignored for the first 15 mins and no the place was not busy, and quite a noisy place with echo and a tad cold. i ordered satay, which was dry and stale along with the fries. there was no love to be found in the food at all, they are not thinking about your next visit. definitely overpriced for the quality. will not return."
"last dinner in the netherlands for this time. an ok ribeye, a good tiramisu, a good bottle of rioja matching the ribeye perfectly. to end wit "
"ordered a plain rib-eye steak medium +. the food came after a long time of waiting, and it turned out they had brought the wrong order. i pointed this out and told that i had ordered something else. then i get a steak that is raw and cold, which i again explain is not okay. after an eye rolling they tried again after a long time of waiting. i ended up with a bad and tastelessly overcooked steak and side dishes and vegatables melted completely. it appears theyve put everything in the oven for re-heating. (at this point i realized this, since the plate was burning hot!) poor service and food, overly priced! left with the decision that im not coming here again for sure. ps. im a former chef and a waiter, trust me on this one."
i had a caesar salad and the satay chicken skewer

"stopped for a meal before our flight, but might as well not hav "
"not exactly grand rather big and spacious self service place, you wont have to wait to be seated. popular and always busy, just opposite security checks, yet the food is fresh and plentiful."
we had beers here waiting for a connection. the food seemed quite good and primarily dutch. beers are ok in that you get more choice than just heineken. it has a nice atmosphere and looks different to the usual airport bar.
"airports are often a challenge when you want to eat something proper, still have some time left and not granted access to the lounges. you often have the fast food places, bars with bar food, sandwich counters and such. so yes it is nice to be able to sit in a bit more restaurant type grand cafe where there are waiters to help you. then at least you dont have to carry your food tray in one hand and your lugage in the other, which is often not practical when you travel alone. this place would suit you. staff is friendly, bit clumpsy in my case. food came quick. yet the quality is compared to the price not in balance. its too expensive. the flavour is average and you can make it yourself at home as well. even the taste was of product you buy at your local supermarket. why 20 euro almost for a chicken sate with pre fabricated tasting rice. and almost 8 euros for a small glass of wine? it is not a premium place, the airport prices again. unfortunate. i picked 3 stars as rating where it should be 2,5. convenience yes, quality no. "
the food and service were o 
"i pass through schiphol frequently and its hard to find somewhere to kill time and relax over food in the airport. this place is not inviting - crowded, noisy and with cramped tables. but surprisingly the food was ok - generous, tasty and comforting chicken satay. and the service was civil and quick enough. what a horrible place to work as humanity surges in and out, either bored witless or frantically rushed. i think the staff do pretty well considering. for an airport its better than cdg paris but not as good as lhr t5 london."
"nothing to complaint, but those airport restaurants always create this nonsense stress feeling. difficult to enjoy. they are probably trying to rotate the tables too fast. too many tables. too much noice. service just ok. you are a number, not a customer."
"we have tried it several times because it is a restaurant on airport schiphol where there is service. but that is just the problem: the service is sooooo slow. when tou ask about it, the utterly uninspired staff simply says that it is normal to wait 45 minutes for a simple sandwich. with no regret whatsoeve "
"not only they did not clean our table, but we had to order 3 times. we did not get glasses for our water. the staff was incompetent and lost - everyone saying someone else would serve us. we wait for the food. and we still were seen as inconvenient because we dared to complain."
"cant say that id eat here again. i was left standing by the entrance for a minute or so before i decided to simply find myself a vacant table. plenty of waiters saw me, but none of them bothered to acknowledge my presence and help me to find a tabl "
"look nice from the outside. a little bit noisy with music and bad acoustics. got a ride year which the cook seems to have cooked instead of fried. bad quality meat with another of fat (even for a rib eye). the vegetables were lousy, however the mashed potatoes was good. there were oot of ice for the dessert at 5pm! the servants were a little bit slow but nice and friendly. not a place i will visit again"
"where in the universe does fast and attentive service matter more than anywhere else? yes, on an airpor "
schiphol airport does not have that many places to go for good food. this grand cafe offers very decent food. that is simply the reason why i go here. i frequently visit this place when i travel outbound at lunch ti 
"only restaurant we ever go to at schiphol. waiters are friendly and the food is ok! its hot and tastes good. seriously, they make the best bitterballen ever eaten at an airport."
"ok place, but typically airport cafÃ© with nice food but double or even triple price. it hurts to pay 3,15â¬ for a small bottle of mineral water, when 1l in the super market costs 0,65â¬. good offer of sandwiches and friendly staff."
went in to get a burger with chips and a co 
"average food at an above average price, although to be expected in an airport. unfortunately the service was abysmal, 45 minutes to order, the order wrong, and no attempt to ask whether it was right. on making a complaint, no attempt to address the issue. i was left with the impression that it didnt matter, since im unlikely to return anyway. "
"my plane was delayed by several hours, and was prowling the terminal looking for a place to wait/relax/eat. of the many eating choices at the terminal het paleis was by far the best. great ambience, food and drink. prices ok, except for the beer which was expensive. "
"i arrive on saturday during lunch time at grand cafe restaurant. during this time, waiters are supposed to run everywhere and be busy. as i will have a long flight, i decide to have a good lunch and i always wanted to go to grand cafÃ© as i often travel trough schipol airpo "
the worst burger at the highest price (20â¬) and with the slowest service (50 mins). very nice job. just because its in the airport and people come and go... if this kind of sub specie of restaurant was in any town of the world the number of clients would be zero. 
rude waiters with an attitude problem. slow service. i will have a beer elsewhere next time. i suggest other do that same.
food was ok. service was slow for an airport restaurant. waiter rude. but less stressed than food court. probably better to eat land side.
had dinner with friends. service was efficient and the food tasted good. the ribeye steak was well prepared and tender. dish lacked a good sous.
was asked to take a table. the waitress too ages to arrive by which time it was too late to order.  on top of that almost all the other places to eat were closing and wouldnt let us in. appalling.
more than ok if you adjust your expectations to the environment where youre in. service was fast and friendly. sufficent choice for a wide public.even the setting is ok and makes you forget youre only at an airport.
the restaurant is roomy and the interior of the restaurant is much above averag 
"this looked like a nice restaurant, but admittedly not particular impressive. the service was slow (the waiters simply had to much to do), the food the usual dutch style food without to much taste. we thought we had plenty of time but a the end we did not as we waited an unusual long time for the food from the kitchen. doubtful i will be back."
"as soon as we stepped foot in the cafe the staff were instantly rude as we asked if they had english menus. when we was ready to be served the lady completely ignored us. slow service for drinks. once our order arrived it wasnt pleasant for the eyes. both our dinners were cold and dont taste very nice. unfortunately we had to pay for food we didnt eat! not impressed!! over priced, rude, horrible place.. dont go !!!! "
"second time through the airport and thought we would try something different from our prior stop. our breakfast meals were average at best. it was quite a bit more expensive than the mediterranean sandwich shop next door. what it did offer was a more private dining experience. if you have the time to sit around for a while you might enjoy it better than next door, otherwise i would stick with the mediterranean place. "
"food nothing special, but could have worked for hungry tummies if it wasnt for the extremely poor service. all waitresses pouted and were not interested in our orders. when orders were delivered some of the sides were missing and they found it sooo annoying to go get it that they lied and said they didnt have any (other waitress supplied later at our request). would not recommend and will not return."
"if i have a stop over at schiphol with a connection to an eu city, i like to stop for a broodje kroket at  het paleis. the service is not always great, the food maybe not what you want/ like as an international traveller, but as a dutchman its like coming home, kroket & beer. decent breakfast as well. last time, august 16, i got good service. but again nothing compared to us standards, unfortunately. ( dutch people: it is the last ( or first) resort) to eat kroketten or bitterballen once you passed customs. i dont think there is a place to order this in the international area at schiphol. cheers and enjoy"
"went here for food before flying home and left most of my food.on the plate. i got ham and cheese.melt with chips. chips were cold and tasteless and toastie seemed dry. my boyfriend enjoyed his bitterballen. waiter wasnt very friendly.and threw our.cutlery at us, wasnt impressed.with this.place at all. "
"we have had good and poor experiences at this restaurant, it all seems to boil down to the waite "
cold food. overpriced. how can you serve cold chips or cold toasts ?  better go to starbuck and buy a muffin with coffe....
was travelling through schiphol a few weeks back and was delayed for a few hours so ate at the grand cafe. the staff were very warm and friendly and offered advice on the specials etc and the restaurant was extremely busy however every customer got 100% attention. the food was served quickly and was nice and tasty and if i am stuck in schiphol again i will be back.
"abysmal and slow service - their interpretation of caesar salad, by the way, is two lettuce leaves and a pile of cheese and mayonnaise - you would think an airport restaurant would be prompt and attentive but you almost have to trip these waiters as they walk past to get them to stop - if you pay with a credit card, youll have to walk up to the waiter station"
"i cant tell you anything about the cafe/restaurant, because there was no service at all. we waited for about 10 minutes and none of the waiters had time to take our order, even though they saw us sitting and gesturing. i guess we were in no-ones service area. go to bubbles! much better!"
"i did not have the lamb like a previous reviewer but the chicken satay was lifeless with a very salty satay sauce. i also did not appreciate that it has one of the airports smoking areas, an ambiance i would prefer not to have with food. the service however was very professional and friendly and the place had a buzz."
"1 totally disinterested waiter present, engaged with phone, not approachable for simple question. not only me but others aswell"
"i bought two small cheese baguettes, crisps and a bottle of water and it came to 24 euro which was really expensive."
too expensive for what you get. the coffee wasnât good more like hot milk and the staff couldnât tell me what was the flat white or the latte.
"everything seemed tasty with pleasant presentation, the ambience was good and spacious  clean and neat. the staff was friendly and served us efficiently. however the prices are way up there. check prices before you buy."
"i saw a mouse on 3 occasions, i reported the matter to the staff in bread and they informed me there were mice everywhere in the airport  - totally unacceptable"
made a mistake in the price... not eager to fix it and gave back the change in 5cents as a vengeance... top management skills there !!!!  in short avoid !!
"i donât feel the need to add any further details, overpriced and stale. choose anywhere else to avoid disappointment."
"two very average ham paninis on disposable bags, two coffees in paper cups and one small bottle of water with no glass, all for â¬33! part of this was â¬6 for an extra shot in each coffee- that is â¬3 per shot into an already made coffee. also, if you asked for one shot less you did not get a â¬3 reduction. and to add insult to injury the coffee comes out of a push button machine and tastes crap. in the uk âbreadâ is slang for money- the name sums them up well. donât bother eating here."
"departures in schiphol is limiting for coeliacs. i was delighted to see this time that bread has gluten-free options. choice of ham or cheese sandwiches. alongside all of the nice and appetising looking normal sandwiches, the pre-packaged gf sandwiches looked weak. i went for cheese and was more disappointed than first impressions prompted. the bread was nice but a single slice of cheese and nothing else in the sandwich just made it a soggy disappointment. all the more frustrating as you got the bread right. just pure thoughtless not putting a proper filling inside. "
"40 euro for a ceaser salad , packet of crisps, a sandwich, a tea & a coffee! realise airport food is almost always over priced but thats just nuts! food nice and fresh but come on guys....thats just a rip off!!"
"pretty perfunctory offering here when you scrutinise it.....sandwiches are fresh and attractive and cold drinks nicely displayed on crushed ice, other than that rather underwhelming, expensive with somewhat indifferent service. itâs an airport so pretty much what you see is what you get!!"
i stopped here for lunch prior to my flight as it was located just past the exit of security. the selection of products was more limited than i expected but i was able to find a warm filled baguette to eat. the food was expensive but i had come to expect that in an airport (10 euros for a baguette and soft drin 
the food was good but staff ignore dirty tables. i was wiping mine and the staff member looked and kept on walking. every table piled with crumbs.
"tried a sandwich with egg mayo, bacon and avocado. it was really tasty and a good snack whilst waiting for my plane."
"the tables and chairs were covered in spills that had clearly been there for a while. when i asked the waiter to clean up, he wasnt sure where to find what he needed. after a long while he emerged with a wet towel. no disinfectant. im not sure hed ever wiped a surface before. he seemed new to the concep "
similar to pret a porter starbucks costa but not quite as good  service was slow and not well organised  panini was plain compared to others
bread as hard as a rock. two stars given as  staff swapped my boyfriends coffee as he accidentally put in pepper instead of sugar
"somewhere to stop for a light bite when in the airport. managed to get breakfast for 4 people for less than 40euros. the sandwiches at ok, nothing special. a nice cup of black coffee"
thought it would be good for a quick sandwich whilst passing through the airpo 
"waiting for our flight i purchased a coffee and cake, nothing special, food a bit bland, then i tried the fresh orange which was a bit tarty instead of the usual sweet.  needs market research to improve, ok if in a hurry though."
not worth going to. its a very busy place but didnt find the food good at all. nothing special. would have rather gone to mcdonalds.
i was very disappointed with the service at bread! the coke which i purchased was overpriced and had more water pumping into it than actual coke. also the hot chocolate we were given was just an empty cup with a sachet in it which was very weak and was not worth the money as it was very bland and felt like a low budget product.
"rude staff member , unhelpful , i would not  spend my hard earned money at this establishment again , i would go to the many other eating place where the staff treat you like a person and not an inconvenience ,"
"whilst i appreciate that 8am on a monday morning is rush hour, there is no excuse to put the slowest server on the tills and then not do anything about  "
"the fact that youre in amsterdam doesnt make a difference. if youre not picky about your food sitting out on the counter, or have a delicate palate, then this is an ok place to grab a bit "
"this place is okay for a quick bite, just dont expect great taste or reasonable prices! we had two glasses of orange juice, a caprese baguette, and a croissant. the orange juice was fresh and lovely and the only saving grace, because the bill certainly wasnt!"
"by far, this was the worst piece of pizza ive ever eaten.  it had absolutely no taste.  the tuna fish sandwich was just as bad.  try some other place in the airport to eat!"
"small bacon & egg sub - â¬6.25, 2 x juices - â¬11.50, small bottle of water â¬3.15. are your eyes watering? yes, its overcharging time at schiphzl airport! average fast food at top restaurant pric "
"youre flying from terminal h at schiphol - theres little to choose from in terms of food. the selection at bread looked tired, wilted or just over-cooked. the only item that was enjoyable was the green smoothy which was a blend of vegetables. i will give bread a miss on the next time through schiphol."
picked this place for breakfast from among the many choices at schiph 
classic overpriced airport fare. tastes okay. got two sandwiches and soft drinks for eur20. wont rush back any time soon.
had breakfast just now. simple bread preparations . nothing to shout about. no fancy ingredients. good choices of juices. vegetarian options available.
"i travel a lot and therefore i am used to the stupid prices at airports, however this place ranks as one of the worst for value for mon "
"no good for people having bread diet... plenty of panini, sandwich, toast, pizza kind of things... fresh juices are also available.."
ideal for a sandwich or snack but they dont appear to have enough staff to clear the tables when the place is busy
"schiphol airport is currently undergoing refurbishment work, so some restaurants have closed/relocated. looking for somewhere with space, i came across bread downstairs in lounge 3. as its name suggests, it specialises in bread - sandwiches, paninis and pizza. ingredients were fresh, but there was a wait to pay, tables werent cleared and the cutlery bins were not replenished. however when i asked staff for cutlery, they were quick to fetch it. you can access schiphol free wifi here."
"yes, they serve bread at bread!. nice, gimmicky decor. our paninis were okay, almost tasty. the plates were weird, gimmicky. all in all we might grab a panini here again. the service/checkout was kind of slow, but on a trip with layovers, who really cares..."
"the food was good, with quick service. but when i asked for more knives and forks - you need a metal one for pizza - i was waved to a second location. there were none there either."
"if you really have to eat at schiphol airport this is one of the best choices. nice sandwiches, pizza slices and panninis."
absolutely disgusting service. i 
nice and smiling service from a lady with beautiful nailsâ¦but the croissant was average and so was the coffee. for a ristretto priced at 4.95euro you should make an effort !
donât go here - hot chocolate is not really a chocolate but milk with bitter non-dissolvable particles. the tables are dirtyâ¦
"waiting for our flight, lets have some good coffee. nope, dirty tables, floors, poor service, no water with the espresso, no chocolate. no pride in their work. and very expensive. will not return here..."
"had a csppuccino here while waiting for my flight. i know in airports everything is expensive, even if this coffee (5,70 â¬) is more expensive than other airports, this is not the main probl "
"my wife and i had a layover here and wanted a quick break and snack. we selected ham sandwiches after a bit of confusion at the cafeteria-like front end. they have a very nice and quiet dining area in the back away from the hustle of the airport, although some people that arrived after we did had a hard time getting a seat. they also had a wield little mystery scent row of atomizers on the wall, and some people were blocking the hallway to the dining area as a result. two sandwichs and drinks were $29, a bit on the high end, but nice to catch a bit of quiet in-between flights."
a fruit bowl of 20 pieces is $8. coffees are > $10. taste is below average ... big no !! service is good but premium on food is not worth
"a place is only as good as every bit of item in its menu. in this case, their croissants and coffee are very  average. they should stick to what they do best - chocolates."
"i last tuesday while i was waiting for my flight i bought tre small pieces of the block of chocolate that they have at the counter. it was very goog looking and expensive too (5 â¬ / 100g). it was also the nastiest milk-chocolate we have ever tasted in our life! the chocolate tasted like soap, perfume or some kind of old make-up. because my flight was already aboarding it was unfortunately too late to turn around and go back to the store to complain about it. my advise to all of you that are tented to buy their chocolate: taste before you buy! it is not only expensive, it is also discusting!"
enjoyed this cozy spot in schipol. the dark chocolate drink really hits the spot in the bleary early morning after crossing the pond. brightens the morning!
"do not get fooled by the nice appearance. this is not a nice place for a coffee and cake. the coffee is nothing special, and the chocolate cake is not worth a try. even worse; the cutlery was dirty, here were hear in the cake. starbucks which is just 50 meters from cafe chocolate is a far better choice!"
"too slow. we left the queue. only a few people in front of us, but we never saw such pathetic personnel. how much walking to and fro can you do for a cup of coffee?"
"i wanted a hot chocolate, i therefore ordered their specialty hot chocolate... only to discover that its some not too hot milk with a chocolate block insid "
"i paid 8.25eur for one of the worst sandwiches of my life. i had a omelette-bacon sandwich that was clearly rewarmed because the bacon had that distinct rancid, soaked dog hair taste. absolutely terrible."
"just a few figures to explain my bad opinion: a cold piece of pizza for 9.25â¬, a dry tosti ham/cheese for 8â¬.no possibility to hear it (even in their kitchen) and employees just busy talking together.... but unlike all the other restaurants in the country, this one is open . "
"perhaps for an airport restaurant, the prices are appropriate but the food offered is just mediocre. we didnât find the staff the least bit friendly but rather indifferent. not a good experience at all"
worst place in an airport that i have ever eaten. the sandwich was stale â i threw it out after one bi 
"had a dried warm panini, water and a fresh smoothie. costed nearly 16 euros.  the panini was overcooked from staying hot. i saw the lady throwing them all away after it sold me mine."
the quality of the food was good but we bought a quinoa salad placed in a bowl of a size that make you think that contains a good quantity of food and then you realize that the bottom was raised/deformed so contained much less portion. the supervisor said that they had run out of smaller containers ..
rip off  way to expensive 7euro for a panini .coffee 4euro .    the only value was a banana for 1euro...
"terrible food. very expensive. very unfriendly staff. i wouldnt recommend this to anyone, even my dog."
landed at schipol at 2 in the morning. this cafe didnt have any food except some fruit bowls for 8â¬.
"its not easy to eat at schipol airport without being hit hard by prices. here i could eat a salad with tuna (without onions) and a nice sandwich with jambon and dried tomatoes at an affordable price. bread was not exactly as mediterranean as i expected, but tastes were a plain ok: i dont think that other restaurants offering lasagna at 20â¬ or pizza would have been good enough for an italian traveller. this place is fair enough for a quick pit stop without stomach aches. good."
overpriced terrible food!!! the juices werent fresh ( dispite the fresh juices sign ) and the coffee was awful...
"overpriced, food was as hard as a rock. tasted like it has been there for over a decade. :( would not recommend."
nice seating area to drink and eat. variety in food and drinks offered. the staff was friendly. prices are airport-like.
"ok, i know, this is an airport sandwich bar. but that would suggest they know they can expect lots of people at certain times.  all i can see around me are dirty dishes. this should be handled much better."
"the airport restaurant offers a nice selection of pricy sandwiches, some of those not warm any more once you pick them. the restaurant is located in the middle of schipol airport and offers some of the rare options to seat there. however, the tables are not cleaned properly and the atmosphere is rushy. once youre hungry on your trip definitely an option, but no must to be."
"awful, even when accounting for the fact its in an airport. the paninis we had were terrible, completely without taste and of course overpriced (airport prices). the eating area was more concerning though as it was filthy, just filthy. the floor was covered in bits of food scraps and was sticky underfoot. the tables and chairs were dirty and the tables were also very sticky. a cleaner wiped down one of the benches holding the cutlery and its condition was worse afterwards as the rag he used was old and dirty and made the bench smell rotten. i find it hard to believe that schipol airport allows such a dirty place to operate."
"tasteless panini tomato mozzarella, asked for small fresh (seems bottled) kiwi/orange with a sigh and a look like i was asking for a million dollars, walked away ... too much staff very busy with themselves .. amsterdam scene totally not interested in guests (if existing at all for them) so many other places here!"
my wife and i grabbed lunch here on our layover in amsterdam. we each got a salad and split a sandwich. the crowds were not heavy during our visit so we managed to find a table and eat without much pressure. we were satisfied with our lunch selections. prices were reasonable for airport food.
"but, at schiophol, its not only airport food. near this restaurant you can take the escalator to the domestic section of the terminal gates (the high number gates on d). just outside d3/d59 (the same gate, btw) youll find a nice outdoor lounge area. enjoy your airport food there. it tastes a little better."
disregarding the outrages prices (airport) this is a bad place to eat for many reasons. labels of the foods are wrong or food is put at the wrong place in the buffet. almost half of the tables are vacant but not cleaned. staff is unfriendly and they dont care. huge long queues. mozzarella panini that i had tasted like nothing! just terrible.
okay for a quick coffee and sandwich. difficult to get a seat so prepare to wait. the coffee is not the best but the sandwiches was pretty good actually.
awful food for simple sandwiches during a business trip at schiphol airport. very poor sandwiches even if coocked. i tried even lasagne pasta and the taste was awful.do not repeat. service quick and place clean.  price average.
"i ate here twice in november and december. having a three stage flight one gets to feel stale and tired in need of an uplifting eating experience. the decor is good and i was drawn by the name meditarranean as i live close to the med and am used to a lovely fresh diet there. many people are in transit here and have endured the best that in flight catering can offer, so when you land you hope to have aomething fresh and tasty. the food is reasonable but a lot of it is bread based and didnt have the zestiness i was seeking agter stale hours of flying and hanging around aiports. on my second visit i had a tuna salad which was very uninspiring, lettuce leaves, tuna and some very greasy olives. fruit juice was very expensive. its ok but i vowed to find something better on my next trip. i found it. see my review for bubbles."
"i had one of those 16-hour layovers when it is too little time too late to go anywhere, but too much time to spend at schiphol. as i was sitting on a chair in front of this sandwich place, first one then two mice caught my attention. i decided, with a shudder, that i am not going to eat any of those luscious looking sandwiches. by the way, other than the mice, they did not have much to eat there anyway until early in the morning, when the mice, understandably, become invisib "
"probably my(our) most frequently visited restaurant at schiphol. seems generelly fresh and of good quality. a few different sandwich options to choose from that should satisfy most people. has also become something of a tradition to get a muffin here, though i think these are made elsewhere and the same you might find different places around the airport. sometimes pretty (too) crowded."
"i had a long wait between to flights, so i went in to this sandwich bar and took a tasty tuna salad with an italian beer. good choice.  friendly staff."
"grabbed a couple sandwiches and drinks for my flight. not expensive. easy in and out. i had the pane serrano and the pan mozzarella, both of which were good."
"2 cappuccino, 2 sandwiches, 2 panini...â¬35,- this is a selfservice restaurant, no a la carte. better to sit nextdoor at the a la carte restaurant. same prices, better service."
"breads are delicious, but due to the layout, before you have picked everything you need and paid, it takes forever to complete the process."
"the sandwiches are ok. its stupid slow set up if you are busy. it takes forever to get through. the handing of trays, glasses, suitcases sucks.  the only reason we keep coming back are one thing.... they have the best cheesecake ever!"
"we had a lengthy layover in the amsterdam airport. there are not many options for food, but we chose this place since it looked better than the other options. the sandwich i had was better than i expected and my wife said the same. in general it is an average sandwich although for a typical airport one, it was a little better than most. my recommendation is to eat before you get to the airport, but if you have to eat at this airport, it is a slightly above average place. "
"this terminal doesnt have good food options. the mediterranean sandwich bar is the healthiest option. i had a smoked salmon sandwich. it was fresh and tasty. in terminal 1 you can find better restaurants, i highly recommend the dutch kitchen."
"1 of 2 beers ordered tasted flat and the gemengdbittergarnituur (âsnack plateâ) was a disasterâ¦ fried everything including braunschweiger!? which really shouldnt, i can now say, be deep fried."
what a sulky english speaking lady who was not interested at all to welcome us at this restaurant. family with 4 we left without even ordering.
"i would have had something to eat here but the three grumpy men put me right off!  talk about long faces, unhelpfulness and poor service just put me off deciding to stay after my drink.  the food looked average anyway."
"this was a sit down place in the schiphol airport mall area. limited menu. we were hoping for dutch pea soup but server was abrupt and said it was only served in winter so had an only fair tomato soup with meatballs. our two entrees, ham and cheese sandwich and toasted cheese sandwich were just ok."
"stopped for a short bite to eat, looks nice but is very noisy insi "
service wasnt great but did eventually get served. i asked for a medium well steak as the menu was quite limited. i specifically said no blood....see picture! all grilled food is done at a separate restaurant across the way which is weird. not cheap either!
"we visited here on our return flight and took a seat, the waiter an older gentleman served everyone round us, we spoke to him a couple of times and he just ignored us so after 15 minutes we left without being serve "
"located at the end of the airport, this bar is a god option to have a drink before a flight, or if you are waiting for somebody to arrive as well. the selection of beers is a bit small, and the food menu is very basic, the food is good, but you can find better options around."
"we were starving and wanted a quick meal. we ordered hamburgers, fries, tea and cok "
"this is more of a pub than a cafe. they sell a lot of beer and some food (which they periodically run out of). waiters are rather unmannerly bordering on rude - but they befit the place they service, especially if you sit and watch the types walking into the bar for a pint. so, if you like the burly, rowdy style for a loud get-together of ole-boys, this place is for you. if you want to take a girl out on a date - find something more elegant. and definitely no children."
"tasteless apple pie, cold server that acted like we were interrupting him and he was doing us a favor, altho the follow up server, a woman, was very nice.  dont go there, not worth the time or the money."
"stopped for light lunch at the airport.  poor quality sandwich compared to other cafes.  two slices of cheese on a hamburger roll, not what you would expect in the netherlands"
"better than par airport restaurant. limited menu, but good basic food. the waiter was super friendly, funny and attentive."
"i dined here with 2 friends before a flight, and the restaurant was out of many things on the menu.  the help were not very friendly."
"food really bad, the steak was so small could not believe it. quality very bad and price way too expensive for the quality and quantity. will not come back."
"wanted to get a drink before flying out. place looks nice and thought id give it a try. had to wait 10 minutes to get the attention of the staff, then waited another 15 before giving up on my order for coffee and jui "
"whoever your chef is, the aussie or brit, i cannot fully get the accent when they swear, do your staff and yourself a favour and fire him. your food should be edible, food is edible as well."
"kitchen staff completely lost with over 30 mins wait with around 20 tables seated. cashier/ staff attitude rude, unpolite and aggressive. if they are unable to run the place they shouldnât do so"
even though itâs in airport it is expensive. staff are friendly and chatty though. didnât try food but beer was nice.
"lacking in vegetarian options no milk alternatives, vegan forget it! slow service, had to wait some time to pay."
terible service! do not choose this restaurant. the food took very long time and was golf. we complaint but the waiter was teribly rude. never again
several places to eat or drink at schiphol whilst you wait. this is a decent enough place to stop. reasonably priced and fairly comfortable. i like to try a couple of places whilst i wait. this was ok but nothing special.
the architecture is very nice. the prices are high as usually at the airports.   the big advantage are the opening times. even very early in the morning you can have something to eat or drink.
"the food was really big portions and it was worth the price paid. the service needs to be a bit more attentive to new customers, as they seem to just wonder round and cannot distinguish easily new customers. saying that, the service was welcome, smiley and very quick in bringing the food and coffees out. "
waited for 20/25 minutes before someone came and took my order. had to ask for a menu for a few times before i received  
nice coffee but incredibly poor and inattentive service. breakfast was slapped on the table with little attention. disappointed.
"the plaza is directly outside the arrivals hall of schipol, and above the railway platfor "
"had the lunch special which was a small soup and a grilled sandwich with goat cheese. i thought that was very good and i love goat cheese. i asked for a âglassâ of water, and ended up with a tiny bottle. this is the european way of charging you for water and i figured that was on me but i was still surprised when that tiny bottle was â¬3.25. outrageous. "
always rude staff! have tried to eat there  a few times and they always say that a part of the chowded restaurang a close so they dont can have more guess.  choose another place!
had a craving for a hamburger and theirs wasnt bad at all....that and a bloody mary made an airport lunch pretty ok...service was stressed at best and we were ignored. place is short staffed for all the tables being filled.
you would never know that this hopping place was so bad with service. it is hard enough to find a spot to sit. once you do it may take a while to get noticed for your order to be taken. 3.20 for coffee that is good. ordered an additonal espresso. long wait. the redeeming factor for this not so grand is the chance given to people watch a little longer. prices reflect the captive schiphol travell 
"after a long waiting time and remarkable skills of the waiters to avoid contact with the guests, it became finally clear that the waiting time for food was about an ho "
great place to eat and meet. i didnât experience the poor service that others have complained abo 
iâm here right now waiting for 15 minutes and nobody came take my order. and i canât get nothing on the bar.
"a club sandwich can mean a variety of things, my experience at around 17:00 on sat april 28th was quite extraordinary bad! bread - ice cold, slightly toasted - yesterday? bacon - ice cold, hard and extremely dry - with texture of old shoe leather! chicken - some small and again ice cold and dehydrated white pieces of flesh that could have been chicken, or just about anything else... 100% taste-free! in addition to this, some green fragments of an undetermined vegetable - and in between all this, a few white, soft, cold pieces of something unclear if it was remains of an egg, or some kind of sour cream based substance. this meal was totally disgusting - and should have been returned to where it came from, the fridge or rather the wastebin! but the waiter vanished - so there was no-one there to address! when i made the order, i asked for some sparkling water, but she claimed they didnt have it (!) - and she told me something about dont ask me why - so she may have feared i would through the so-called club sandwich at her, so she disappeared... wisely enough..."
"after queuing up for 15 minutes to get a table in the only restaurant where you get served at schiphol airport that i could find,i was told that there is a waiting time of 30 minutes for any food. this is not acceptable for an airport restaurant.why not telling me that while waiting? "
"i was there to await and arrival. i sat down and was approached rudely in an unprofessional manner. the menu was very greasy and over-used. the prices indicated on the photographed menu are very high for dutch standards, â¬ 4,10 is an outrageous high price for a standard draft beer in amsterdam. therefore all in all not a good representative service and price for amsterdam customs."
stopped in the arrivals area and have lunch comprising of a smoothie and an italian burger. the burger had  mozzarella and pastrami and overall pretty good.  smoothie was just like fruit juice so not really thick.
"ordered ribeye with veggies and baked potato, arrive colder than my beer, waitress agreed, sent it back, arrived back a few moments later luke warm.   very nice staff hence the one star....but terrible food"
"on a transit through amsterdam airport, so forced lol, to have a drink, good choice of wines and food, stuck to just a glass of wine, service was pretty hopeless, barstaff despite having the technology still walked around auctioning drinks!"
"dreadful service. rude, got order wrong and waited forever to be served. bland overpriced food. avoid ."
"i often wonder why airport restaurants are so bad. is it because they think that they have a captive market and no one would come back anyway? anyway, not great food, terrible service - the older man that served us was entirely useless and clueless - and exorbitant prices meant that we will definitely not be back."
i have visited here 5 times but have only been served twice. tonight i walked out for the third time after 15 minutes. just cant get served absolutely the worst service i have ever seen

"the service is excrutiatingly slow - you get ignored until you raise your voice, and then you are served huffily. the place is clearly understaffed so it would be better if the staff kept their conversations witheach other shorter, and paid more attention to the customers - and it wasnt particularly busy. prices are standard for amsterdam, but if this was not at the airport, they would go bust very fast. odours of old cooking oil wafting from the kitchen convinced us to rather eat elsewhere."
"even by airport standards this place is substandard.  too hot inside to sit at regular table, and patio tables were tiny.  food was eatable, but that is about all.  obtaining and paying bill was a chore."
"after eating local food hoping for good food. was more like thawed food microwaved. fries were bit dark, older shortening. pork was tiny. bit pricey but at airport expected. ok for on the go."
the service: the service could be better. we were waiting for a waiter or waitresses for at least 15 minutes and it was not bu 
"service was poor, place wasnt that busy, had to call over a waiter numerous times. had our 76 year old father with us, he was using a trolley to lean on as we walked around the terminal, it was left near our table to use again as we were leaving and a waitress came over and was rude and asked us about the trolley as it was in the entrance way and it wasnt, it was next to our table. we ordered a toasted ham and cheese sandwich to be rudely told it was only available until 5pm. food quality was good but none of the staff were helpful, when we asked for bill, was rudely told to go the register to pay. wouldnt go back."
we kind of expect more from schiphol and this place was ok but not much more.  a competent menu but wait staff seem distracted and certainly not into customer service.....why bother when youll never see most of your customers again?
"limited menu with burgers, some salads and pasta. quality of food ok but absolutely not more. ordered a salmon and asparagus salad but got no asparagus. when we told the waiter we got some more salmon but they were out of asparagus. its that kind of place if you see what i mean. "
not a wide range on the menu but cooked to order. a little pricey but it is what you would expect for an airport.
"likely not having a lot of returning customers ive had bad experience here twice or three times already. staff is very busy chatting to each other, instead of earning the overpaid prices for food and drinks here. if they finally found the way to your table, you better order while you can as they dissapear again to chat with their colleagues if you dont decide fast enough. pay 19,- for a basic burger and some fries. for 21,- you are eating a quality meat burger at the restaurant of the hilton hotel, with in the lobby a nice spacious and quiet bar for short business meeting for example. just avoid this place, not worth it. the only value it has is its location at the arrivals."
"this review is of the grand cafe plaza, situated in the main shopping concourse near the entrance to terminal 3. (some of the photos show a different grand cafe het paleis "
"the cappuccino tasted like hot tap water, no quality at all. it looks like it was made by a bad automatic machine. very disappointing."
the 20 euro dutch burgers were tasty and fulsome and the heineken beer was suitable chilled but equally overpriced. chips on the cold side but otherwise ambience is good and service pleasant and efficient. it is a good spot for keeping an eye on the queues at passport control if you are in transit.
very quick servi 
i had coffee here after dinner. the coffee was average. the service average. good place to sit and watch the passing parade.
good for an airport cafe. dont expect too much. it is not a gourmet restaurant as some people expect....where do they go to travel? it can be busy but it is a nice place to while away a hour or two.

to meet friends and to rest after arrival or before departure.  the location is right next to the gwk tax forms on the arrival floor.  its easily found and the price is cheap.  they have sufficient menu for small meals and drinks.
i used to go here regularly for the fantastic chicken satay. throughout the last years the service has decreased to the point that last i visited i waited for about 25 minutes without getting a menu or the waiters attention... individuals around me faced similar service... i was forced to leave. adieu grand cafe!
"this cafe is on the right spot. easy to find. just when you arrive, take your luggage and walk through exit :) food is also great. we had hamburger and chicken wings. staff are friendly. this is a good place to chill when you arrive and before your departure."
"the place was having a really bad day-- the card reader was down so they could take cash only. however, that does not excuse eggs, sausage, and bacon served cold or tea water so tepid that it was unable to brew tea. and, when asked what kind of tea we wanted, we said earl gray at the urging of the staff. we got something else. while i understand they were having issues, the food and tea could have been served hot, especially given the large size of the staff on the floor."
"theres nothing grand about this cafe, but its one of the few real restaurants at the airport. we had lunch there on arrival as its the most convenient place to go. however if you are hungry and want fast service this might not be a good choice as we waited for almost 30 minutes for a hamburger. food quality is decent, and price not too unreasonable. best thing about it is you can sit there and watch the world go by in the arrival hall and be entertained."
"called in as i had a 4 hour connection and ordered a cola and a club sandwich, not something i though would be too testing to prepare and ser "
"least bad choice of restaurants in b/c piers  waiting staff make it clear youre there to order food and to be quick about it. quality of the food is distinctly average - price-wise however very high, even for european airports."
"after 20 minutes of sitting and being utterly ignored i came to the counter and asked the waiter how long would i wait. wait for what? was his resolute answer... he came to our table after couple of more minutes and forced himself to take an order. i asked for sirloin steak to be told that there was no such thing in the menu. when i pointed it using my finger, the reply was oh, that one... then we had a brief discussion on good manners to which he just laughed at me and left our table. few minutes later a lady waitress came to... take our order! to my remark that the order has just be taken she replied that there was nothing on the computer. at that point we left to never come back to this horrible place. "
"nothing special, just airport quality. dont expect hospitality and feed yourself. why cant airport restauarant offer more?"
"plenty of food but as usual, expensive because you are at the airport.  wide choice of foods on the menu.  something for everyone."
"good space, east to sit wth luggage, english menu, ok selection, nice draft ever, seated quickly, waitress came up quickly ordered drinks said shed be back for our food order. did not return, asked another water if he could take our order, he said no had to be our waitress and he would send her. that didnt happen, eventually flagged down another waiter he took our order no problem. so good, but insistent service"
"while the food was average, both waiters i eventually was in contact with, made little effort to conceal what a annoying burden i added to their day by utilizing their services. i generally have a fairly relaxed attitude to the level of service, but this is one of the very few places to which i will never return."
"the food is average, even for an airport.  the service was good, speedy and friendly.  the price was 13.95 for a burger, fries and a beer which i was charged for twice! - check your bill...."
"after our flight we wanted to grab a bite before going home. after 5 minutes we ordered our food. 15 minutes went by and still no good or drinks! what made the long waiting worst was that people who came in later got their drinks earlier then we did. we will never go there again. the place is clean and nice, the food is good. "
"had an evening meal, which was quite ok, even though the meat could have been more tender. the service was slow though and far from impressive. overall good value, but service leaves room for improvement."
"good wines per glass, menu shows quality but still the dishes need to be cooked with care. all my requests were granted but i prefer to eat without need to ask."
"i had dinner at otium, the restaurant at the radisson blu. it was pretty good. i had the chicken supreme which is a chicken breast with with an asian sauce, bok choy and udon noodles. the flavor was good however the chicken had quite a bit of skin and fat and was a little rubbery. it wasnt bad, but not great eithe "

"i had a conference in the hotel, and i hesitated going to amsterdam. you can pay 70â¬ for a taxi (20 min), or take the shuttle (free, every 20 min) back to the airport and then the train (8â¬, 30 min), and then transport to where you need to go. not worth  "
"went to the otium restaurant when staying in the hotel recently. i was quite hungry so ordered from the main courses the chicken with potatoes and vegetables - i believe it was â¬24. when it came it looked like a childs portion - a small chicken brest, 1 carrot, one small piece of broccoli and 2 small potatoes. i finished it in about 5 minutes and was still hungry so ordered so ordered some bar finger food. what i had was nice but they are charging â¬24 for presentation so it was very poor value. i could have easily eaten double the amount, so if your hungry go elsewhere."
my husband and i had dinner here the night we stayed. for the price i really expected better quality. i had a filet or at least that is what i ordered. it was unlike any filet ive ever had. it looked like a filet but it was tough and not very tasty. the texture reminded me more of a club sirloin.
"this restaurant feels like its trying to join the big boys with terms like sous vide and smoked potato foam on the menu. we selected truffle risotto which was properly cooked but absolutely tasteless. there were tiny flecks of something brown in the dish, but it might as well have been sawdust for all the flavor it added. even the shaved parmigiano cheese and the bits of asparagus in the dish didnt manage to add any taste."
"we stopped in while staying at a nearby hotel, the park inn. i had the risotto with truffles which was cooked correctly but the broth was not boiled down properly and so it was soupy. i complained and the friendly waitress asked if i needed anything and suggested a free salad. her kindness was appreciated. with the risotto and a plate of cheese divided with my colleagues and part of a bottle of wine, i paid 31 euro."
"i stopped by for lunch while waiting for a flight. the food was very average, then again the prices arent too steep eithe "

"staying at the radisson blu there isnt much option than to eat at otium, and although its not great value-wise i had a decent dinner."
"otium is unfortunately the only local dining option if youre staying at the radisson blu airport hotel. the service was slow, portions were small, the food is not very good and it is quite price "
"i came here because the radisson park inn hotel kitchen is closed on sundays, and they advised to come here, since it is hosted by the radisson blue hotel. i just wanted to have dinner, possibily without having to go bankrupt. i decided to take a quail salad: it costed about 12 â¬, and it was a portion so small it could have been ok for my 2 years old niece. just to give a term of comparison, for 10.50 â¬ at the radisson park inn you can have a chicken salad, which turns out to be better both in quantity and in quali "

"ate solo in the bar area. food was good if a little on the pricey side, but not excessive for an airport hotel.   sadly getting attention of waiting staff was painful, nice people but not attentive"
"the food is very overpriced for what it is - take 50% off and youd be in the ballpark. food was very plain and bland. even the burger (well done/no blood) came out with raw meat, they were reluctant to cook it more and all they did was sear the part showing and when bitten into it was still raw. even with very few patrons, they took ages to do anything including bringing the bill which had no discount despite not eating the uncooked me "
"i was staying at the steigerberger airport hotel due to a missed connection at ams, and the airline included dinner with the room. it was a sunday and only the bar was open. i had a chicken sandwich, which was ok. when i gave the server my voucher for the free meal she got a little upset because apparently one can only get certain items off the menu with the voucher. i explained to her that no one told me that, and her response was, you didnt ask. i guess you can be rude when travelers have no choice. if id arrived earlier in the day if you have time, take the train into amsterdam and eat at one of the many excellent restaurants there."
i had a meal here while staying at the steigenberger hotel. the burger i had was tasty but the price was quite expensive (â¬22). theres not really any other options though so youre stuck here for food unless youre driving.
"food is ok and the staff are very friendly, this is however the only option if you stay in tha steigenberger hotel over the weekend."
i walked from airport to avoid eat some âairport foodâ and following the hotel ranking. i tasted the salmon that was delicious but the servi 
"nice place, pretty good food. watch out for the recommended for two persons menu item. itâs way not enough for two (price is, quantity isnât) the extra burger was needed to complete the meal."
"in europe tips are not the main portion of income, but tonight, i dinned alone and another stranger from same country sat alone next to me. we struck an engaging conversation. we converged to 1 table and paid our respective bills while finishing our beverages. we were asked to move to the bar bc they needed to seat others waiting. many empty tables around and waiter, balraj asked us to move to bar area. we did and 12 min laterâ¦still empty seats. as a diamond with hilton, i may switch to marriott bc of serviceâ¦or lack there ofâ¦"
front of house service was brusque and off hand when we asked to be moved from a very large and noisy group area.  took ages to get out 1st course and even longer for the 2nd course. food was bland. a very impersonal experience.
stayed at the hilton the night before our flight home so decided to have dinner here in the hotel. appetizers and entrees were good but nothing special or outstanding. think we could have had just as good a meal or even better at one of the many restaurants in the airport mall and for less money.

"this restaurant is very interesting place to review because it sits in a classification between being clearly preferred and feature restaurant of an international chain hotel and also, perhaps, it wants to have its own identity. having read some of the other reviews on this site, i was expecting the food to be stronger than it was based on my two opportunities to eat he "
"i ate dinner here earlier this week during a layover at the hilton schiphol airport (this is their on-property restaurant). overall, its a great restaurant with lovely food, a nice atmosphere, and seats where you can watch the chefs/cooks do their thing. id easily increase my rating to 4-5 stars if it werent for our server, niki. i say server because she only visited our table 4 times during the evening; to bring us menus, to re-fill our water, to bring the dessert menu (which we had no interest in given her poor service) and to bring our bill. i will say hats off to the rest of the team, who took our orders and brought our meals, as well as checked on us to ensure all was ok. niki did none of these. she was simply horrendous and if you choose to eat here, avoid sitting in her section."
"the bowery is the upscale restaurant of the schiphol airport hotel. it serves expensive but very good quality lunch and dinner dishes. using high quality and local sustainable ingredients. regrettably during a busy lunch hour it was seriously understaffed leading to the ball being dropped ... cutlery forgotten, food coldish, slow with the bill. atmosphere also a bit unrelaxed with many conference lunch eaters coming and going. staff managed to remain friendly despite the pressures. "
we both went for the asian menu selection. i had the beef and my friend had the sticky chicken both of which were very good. i ordered a bottle of rose - which was very nice but once our glasses were poured the bottle was taken away. it was never topped up unless i requested it from the waiter despite having an empty glass for over 10 minutes. we had almost finished the bottle - about 4cms left in bottom when he took it away and brought us a new bottle. i said i wanted the remainder of our bottle of wine not a new one and he replied that he had thrown it away as they never serve the last drop of wine due to sediment! i have never had this with a bottle of rose. maybe with a red. so i felt we were cheated out of a glass of wine! itâs the principal not the cost. so be aware when ordering wine here. 
as we were stranded passengers we felt slightly segregated from other guests because it was a free service! the food wasnât great compared to the bar food we also had during our stay! was almost like we had âleftoversâ however the food that guests were eating looked amazing as we walked through to our buffet 
"have you ever been to one of those restaurants where you pick up the menu and after scanning and re-scanning it, you think, actually im not really sure i fancy any of this? id just like something simple, easy-to-understand and comfortin "
"had my breakfast here for 5 days. typical same menu every single day. lunch a little variety. really, not impressive at all. the good thing, staff are nice, warm and courteous. "
"the restaurant claims to serve the best burger in town. well.. they dont. if they wanna claim anything, it might be worst burger in town. the burger was hard and rubbery, the tomato and gherkin were almost frozen, the bacon far from crispy and the taste almost chemical. after trying everything separate, it was clear that all products used were far from good. with b-quality its hard to make the best burger. staff was friendly but quite inexperienced. and way too much hassle: unfolding the menu, introducing them selves, asking whether we want the drinks menu on the table or not, the bill in a little tin.... a concept can be nice but this is too much for our taste. we also tried the mushroom croquettes (yuk!), the gyozo and other things and nothing made us very happy. they could do so much better. and with their prices they should do better. "
staff is friendly. food is taste good but a little bit pricey. burger is recommend. please make sure staff is put a right room number on the bill.
food was good but staff attitude poor. at peak times staff tends to be very hectic and forgets many orders if you come with a group of more than 5 people. inattentive and insensitive to customers.
ordered still - gave sparking. ordered medium well - gave rare. but worst - husband ordered seafood bisque - gave some kind of chicken soup instead.... and no takeaway allowed of leftovers if u dont finish - never again 
"whether you dine alone or with a 3 [as i did] it is really comfortable. staff is knowledgeable, wines are tasty and all three starters that we ordered were up to expectation. the main course however was not. the nasi goreng had not enough flavor and was not indonesian enough. too bad, this could be a great dish on the menu. but, there is enough to choose from so hopefully other dishes are more tasteful. for sure a place to return to."
"staff was friendly and welcoming. some issues with the service but nothing serious. food was only average, i honestly was expecting little bit better for the price. pretty standard hotel quality, nothing really wrong with that."
"as other reviewers have noted, service is spotty. it took more than ten minutes to get any drinks on my table. i saw several patrons actually get up from their tables to go ask for their checks. fortunately i brought along something to read. food was ok, but not outstanding. "

"bright (almost too bright), airy and welcoming restaurant in the schiphol hilton. exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. swift, attentive (tending towards too attentive....this is a fine line guys!) service. ate dinner and breakfast here recently. food beautifully presented. dim sum, excellent. nasi goreng very bland. the prawn (tempura style) was rubbery, cold and undercooked. the coating soggy....bit unfair to raise this now since i didnt complain at the time and allow problem to be rectified, but notice this wasnÂ´t an isolated case. breakfast was very good. appreciated those small touches....coffee brought in large thermos....orange juice served and topped up....one of the lovely staff tempted us with warm pancakes brought to table. may i suggest seating larger groups away from couples? we fled a raucous group of men placed next to us. sorry....do not do loud in a morning."

"while staying at the hotel it is a logical point of getting food. however, while the food quality is quite good, the service is very very slow. some guest were waiting 15 minutes to pay..."

"the food was good, not exceptional. but very convenient, as i was staying in the hotel and the price of the food was reasonable for a 5 star hotel."
"the hotel is very nice and we were looking forward to an equally nice meal after a very long day of international travel. we arrived at 9pm. the restaurant was not busy, but we had to wait ten minutes for a table. that was our first sign that things would not go well. finally, we were seated at a table that was not dressed. a couple who arrived after us, received menus, water and a greeting from a waiter before us. we waited and waited. nothing. after ten minutes, i called over for a waiter. we received menus and had the table set. we quickly decided on our choices, but again, no waiter. he had disappeared. we waited so long that the couple next to us were served bread and their drinks. there is an open kitchen where we watched a frantic chef fussing over dishes. he was expending so much energy, but it seemed misguided due to the bad service and so few tables to serve. i called over the hostess once again so we could order. she took our ordered and explained that there had been a delayed flight and the restaurant was crunched trying to prepare dinner for the passengers. there was a buffet already set up for the delayed flight. it was a poor excuse. our poor service was due to a disorganized staff and lack of professionalism and experience. surly, an international airport hotel should have well trained staff prepared to serve tired travelers. no one comes to the airport just to eat out. everyone there is traveling, jet lagged and wanting to eat and move on. i ordered miso salmon and my husband ordered a hamburger. my salmon sat under a hot lamp for nearly ten minutes while the chef fussed over stylizing plates. the salmon was overly sweet and over cooked. we were so annoyed by the entire experience we couldnt wait to get out of there. we would stay at the hotel again, but not eat at the restaurant."
ok hotel is ok a la hilton bit far from terminal advertised closer its a serious walk all the way at the e 
average breakfast and dinner. good value for price since breakfast is juts 15 euros and you can have continental buffet and fresh made omelet.
"this place is fine if you are staying in the hotel, but i wouldnt recommend it otherwise. breakfasts here were good with lots of options. service was friendly, if a bit disorganised,"
"the quality of the meals was good. i liked tom kah kai. it was a little bit salty though. steak tartar was excellent. my wife ordered asian wrap, which was not the one she expected. the problem is waitresses. they were very nice, but not efficient and not professional. they socialize each other and do not pay much attention to customers. a lady next to us asked for the dessert menu, but nobody came back to take order for 10 min. not surprisingly she just left. they need to be more trained and the ms ages should watch how they are doing for customers. we did not get bread and some au de voir despite the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine."
"this is the restaurant of the hip and fun schipol airport hilton. the interior is modern and trendy, but for some inexplicable reason the waiting staff are dressed as farme "
"i was taken to my table but then ignored for the next 10mins, until i finally got someones attention to provide me with a menu. why dont they leave a menu with you once you reach the table? the codfish had little flavour but the accompanying bread was delicious. disappointing."
"presentation was nice but the taste was very average. service was friendly and efficient. they are still in the startup, do plenty room to improve."
"the host was friendly, took a long time to get a menu and bead provided was really great as was the butter etc this was the go "
"i was intrigued by the write up about this restaurant, so i asked for a seat where i could watch the kitchen in action. interesting, but didnt see all that much. while steady business, i was most disappointed with poor service. i waited at least 15 minutes for my plate to be cleared and then another 1/2 hour for my server to bring my check! the menu choices are mediocre. the fresh roasted veggies were greasy and underwhelming. would probably take a cab to eat elsewhere next time considering the prices, selection and service. there is an amazing sized hamburger on the menu for the hungry person, though!"
"great food selection on menu, and terrifically cooked. only negative is the very slow wait between courses. fifteen minutes between ordering and soup arriving; then ten minute wait for main course, and then fifteen minute wait to receive dessert (in fact had to remind the staff each time to bring the next course) - all this perhaps because the restaurant (and the hotel itself) are new (opened in december 2015) and still undergoing shake-down."
"we decided to discover bowery for a lunch. the place is nice, with a great decoration and atmosphere. nevertheless the service was a complete disaster! arrogant, unprofessional, more than 40 min to get dishes... bref unacceptable for hilton and a nice moment which turn into a nightmare!"
this really is a pathetic and pretentious place. the worst was the very agressive pushing by the waiter to leave a tip on the credit card. upselling the (good) house wine as if it was something very special was plain silly.
service was mediocre. asked for something light because i was not hungry and got a big heavy slab of mea 
"a bar and restaurant, all mixed together. the resatauant serves simple food and a speciality called the daghap, every monday. food for a low proce."
"we have previously had breakfast/ coffee here and, though the service was often slow, the food was good. today, however, we had no opportunity to sample the food, because we could not find someone who would serve us. when we arrived there were two customers outside and two inside who had already been served, and four tables were still littered with old cups etc. we asked twice for someone to take our order, but no one appeared. after ten minutes and still no service four other tables were occupied - and not served. meanwhile one customer outside who had asked several times for his bill (to no avail) left without paying. we registered our dis-satisfaction to someone who appeared to be in charge, who told us there were problems with their new system, though she and her colleague had been busy with arranging a pretty display and not clearing tables or serving customers. we were at least offered a cup of coffee which we declined. we shall not be returning."
"i went there with my son on a sunday midday to have some lunch. we sat down outside and looked at the menu. there were two waitresses serving the terrace of which one had sat down with some clients (her friends?) and was in a conversation with them. the other waitress took orders at some tables. she passed our table five times without even looking at us. at the sixth time i asked whether we could order something. she replied: âyes, but i am very busyâ, and immediately went inside. again, she did not even look at us. when she came out after another two minutes, she again passed us without paying attention to us... unbelievable. at that point we got up and left. unnoticed by the two waitresses. absolutely uncalled for: what a rude, uninterested, incompetent staff! we live in the neighborhood, but will not be back."
"i have tried on numerous times both pizza and pasta - and sad to say i rather buy frozen ones at albert heijn or make my own - my kids dont eat them, and i must say we have been dissapointed everytime. we wont be back here again at all"
"we went there with the family after a firm forrest walk. the staff was welchmng us very friendly as we arrived with no reservation. the staff presented the menu and the drink were taken. we ordered some starters and some main courses. the starters, a bisque with ginger and the tartar with carpers. then we had some salmon and a venis "

especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"
"lovely dinner, though seated very close together.  menu was nice, good execution, wasnât wowed weâve had a lovely dinner, waiters were nice, all was clean."
"we had the 6 course tasting menu, everything was just pretty much ok, nothing spectacular, nothing to remember. i guess prices are fair"
"the food was good, but the restaurant is very noisy (bad accoustic). the room is small and packed with tables, which makes it less cozy. i had a draft on my neck from the air conditioning."
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the satÃ© was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brÃ»lÃ©e very good."
with a guest at restaurant at bomans settled down for an evening me 
"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend â¬120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.
"restaurant is very conveniently located for locals to walk to dinner rather than drive. food of decent quality (but would not use the superlatives i see in other reviews), which for us was what we where looking for. price was on the high side for the achieved level of the foo "
a small restaurant in the middle of the mainstreet of the village. make a reservation. good food list with meals you expect. the meat dish liver is perfect. ask for a table not to close to the entrance.
"very decent lunch platter, very big portions. terrace is nice with shade or sunshine options. service wasnât the quickest, but overall it was okay."
"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staffâs eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying âdat meen je niet!â she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long sheâd like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadnât made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was âoerâ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though iâd ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that heâd promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.
"large restaurant with all you can eat buffets; fish, meat, chnese, etc. temperature so, so. saladbar was ok. drinks are expensive or choos al you can drink for 2 hoursâ¦â¦."
stopped for coffee and pancakes but then had the very embarrassing experience when we came to pay that they didnât accept visa credit or debit. it has to be cash or a dutch bank card! first time after five days in holland we had to get cas 
food and service was very good even the owner of the restaurant came a couple of time to our table to talk with us. in general a good experience only the menu could be a bit bigger with more options.
nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
"its as if the staff walk around actively trying to avoid getting into contact with customers. ive waited for 10 minutes, 3 servers walked by and none of them even said as much as hello. ive walked away from their terrace for the second time in a few weeks now. this used to be a fantastic restaurant. good food, good ambiance. sadly, they seem to have slipped. "
the meat from the grill was very dry and some of the side dishes rather poor. a good feta saganaki and greek lukanica did raise our final opinion
"i come here multiple times a year and usually i enjoy the food. tonight was below anything ive ever seen. i got served a well done steak that should have been rare. i sent it back. the second steak was a pathetic thin piece of meat, that was obviously put straight from the cooler on the grill. it was dead cold. i was the only person in the group who wasnt eating, yet the waitress manages to completely ignore this. she even goes so far as to come to our table to ask if i want anything to drink. about 45 minutes later, when clearing the table she asks was it not to your liking?... no, i always leave my steak untouched on the plate... the chef didnt wish to come because he was too busy with the other 3 tables. i left and i wont come back. "
food is all inclusive as are drinks but is of a poor quality.  our kids had to go out and get takeaway pizza ... golf was fun though!!!!
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25â¬, and salad 9.75â¬. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"we took two burgers on the lunch menu. bad meat, bad bread, almost no salad. non smiling service. not a great place. though it is well located."
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."
"went there for a drink and snack, waitresses very friendly and correct! ordered nacho with guacemole, it came disappointing, hiddious! guacemole came out of a tin, processed rubbish! never seen this before. the ladies toilets stunk. definitely need a good cleanu "
"good place to go for a drink. de brasserie had a central location in emmen, friendly waiters and a lot of beers to chose from."
"ill qualify this review first by saying im irish with a dutch husband well versed in all things irish and particularly fond of a pub of the irish inclination. after moving to emmen we were quite excited to find a local irish pub. so the husband and myself headed out one evening. firstly, the staff are great. friendly, helpful and around just the right amount of time. full marks. waiting staff, these stars are for yo "
food: 3/5 
i asked some vegetarian options among a rubbishy pre set tapas meal. after 45 minutes scouring through random pieces of meat i found 2 meager options. luckily the waiters gave me enough time to find it before being able to serve the next round.
"the restaurant has got a nice terrace and plenty of indoor seating. menu is mainly deep-fried food. the actual cheeseburger i got was greasy, tasteless and rather expensive."
sorry to say this but the food just was not go 
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
i went here a few times. first of all i have the feeling it does not get better. furthermore i dislike the fixed prices. i went here with my pregnant sister and when she wanted to replace the more expensive beef with the much cheaper giros meat (as that is not good during the pregnancy) she was still forced to pay the same. some guests also got a free ouzo but not all.... that is not very nice. all together a rather average experience.
the plates of the main course where full of meat as is normal in greek restaura 
"they say its the best greek in town, but thats not hard with only 2 option "
"nothing special, weve been to worse but weve been to a lot better greek restaurants. we prefer to drive to meppen germany and have Ã  greek meal there, so munch better!"
"well, the title says a lot, doesnt it. perhaps im being a bit negative, but after visiting them 3 times i keep getting the feeling that i should not come again. one time i was there i requested that i would not like a scoop of chocolate ice cream in my trio of ice, but rather have an extra vanilla instead.. i was gobsmacked when they told me that i could only order what the menu said !.. ( still cant get my head around that ) last time i had no choice as the other restaurants were fully booked, so we just sat there outside, waiting for someone to come by.. ....... which took a while... and when someone came, we asked for the menu, ............ which never came, so we collected it ourselves. and after reading that for a kids menu under 12 y.o. the child would have to prove it by an id, thats when i stood up and wen "
"the location in the center of emmen is excellent. nice and cosy restaurant. the food is ok, but not special. service is good."
well its okay but not one of the better restaurants in emmen. there are better options for a lower price.
old outdated restaurant with an outdated menu. we were the only ones in the restaurant and when i ordered a double espresso she gave me two espresso on top of eachother. so that isnt professional at all and the prices are way to high for the food and service you get here.
more a bar then resturant. had carpaccio which was placed on buttered bread. first time eaten that way and i guess there is a reason. it does not work.
"service is average, but nice. food is average nothing more nothing less. competition would be great for this restaurant i presume. asperges were ok but not really good, fries and wine average, everything is average here. i think they are great for large groups and tourists, for great they really have to make a huge step. "
"the usual, standard layout and optio "
place looks well decorated and compared to the past the long cues are solve 
"the food is not well cooked, very few dishes. last time i ate raw potatoes and a disgusting cake. better eat in another place."
visited la place this afternoon 
"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
"well, its not easy to find a vegetarian menu at this place, only coleslaw and corn so my friend took what he needed and we went to another fast food restaurant next door. we came here before the lockdown"
i just came by here at the drive thru for a quick dinner whilst we were sat waiting for the food window we saw 6 pretty big rats running around in the space of 7 minutes 
canât describe the lack of efficiency here. i sat at the table for 1h with my family waiting. what did we order? 4 simple paninis and 2 soups. the amount of people during this hour that decided not to wait and left was impressive (also the trays with drinks brought to empty tables and back into the fridge after being re closed). for our drinks weâonly â needed to wait for 30min. i must say that the food was great. or we were just starvin 
"the croque monsieur was reheated and absolutely dreadful. have been before, but now they have started reheating the food i will never go back"
first of all the menu promised a bread-sommelier to help with the decision on what type of bread would compliment your topping. the only question we got was white or brown and later they came to me that they didnât even had brown bread. and just fyi at this moment there were 5 tables and 4 waiter 
"the first impression was not so good. despite hardly any guests in the cafe there were many dirty, not cleared tables. also one chair at our table was dirty. as we were hungry, we decided to give it a try. we ordered a full lunch with hot meals and drinks plus tap water for the kids. however, the restaurant refused to serve the tap water and came with small bottles for each of the kids. why is unclear: we were spending enough so why no tap water for kids? why wasting bottles if tap water in holland is superb? we did not get a good answer: only âcompany policyâ. the food itself varied from good (salmon, ârundvleeskrokettenâ) to mediocre (pancakes, fish and chips). service was quick. when we paid (unfortunately you cannot pay at the table but need to go to a till) we were very surprised to see that we had to pay â¬0,50 for ketchup. the fries came with mayo, so why not change for ketchup? in conclusion: not a good experience. will not come back. "
we had fish and chips and chicken satÃ©. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"too much pepper in the burger, fries tasted a bit like they were made with old oil, but the spare ribs were juicy and tender. nice outdoor seating."
"we ate good steaks only we received only one serving of french fries instead of two. some people who were alone received one serving of french fries same portion we received. it was not fair. then we finished our food, the waitress came & we asked why only one portion. i forgot what she said. just like discrimination because we were the only brown people that time. she asked if we wanted another portion of french fries. ah ah... what an excuse!...we were finished already. then she asked!!!the place is good & food to "
i ordered take out 2 rib menus. the ribs were extremely fatty and with a lot of bone splinters. the taste of the meat was fine thoug 
"service was good with friendly staffs. starters such as mushroom with cheese, goat cheese, onion soup and smoked salmon, were excellent, they smelled really good. main dish had a reasonable portion. meat was good. fish was tasty. if you arent in a hurry for dinner, this place can be your choice because it takes a bit time to get food delivered to your table."
"we were with the four of us. we told the restaurant we were going to the theater after dinner. we had two hours planned for dinner but after one and half hour we were still waiting for our main course. we told the waiter we were concerned , but that didnt help much... we did make it in time but it was only just."
"we first ordered drink and then lunch. after seeing most of customers got their food, we asked a staff (there were only 2 staffs) about our food. the staff looked blank and said she did not take our orders. unbelievable!!! she looked into her note and found out it was her. it took in total 45 minutes to get lunch. food was delcious though and restaurant looked cozy though. "
"this place offers a 3 course menu with different options for a good price, eur. 14,50. next to the dinner menu they offer an extensive beverage menu with some nice cocktails. the place itself is very nice and attractive however the employees are not service minded at all. as a customer you have to ask them for a menu, ask them to take your order, ask them to clean the table etc. that is sad seeing how beautiful the place is and the potential it has. you can have a nice time there for dinner and lots of fun drinking after your meal but the service doesnt motivate you."
"service in general was fine, altough one of the guys forgot that i ordered an extra beer. but one of the dishes we ordered totally did not match the menu. it should have tomatoes, bascilicum and ..., but it had totally different vegetables and a bell pepper sauce - which was for sure not mentioned. next to that, the dish was super saulty. so we were nit so happy about the food, we did get a discount when we mentioned it though."
"normal bar, trendy inside, but very poor waitering. more then once i ordered my drinks at the bar which they would bring to the table and then waited more then 20 minutes. the bill is also qwuite often a surprise..."
waited a long time to be served. then waited a long time for my drink. when i ordered my meal and second drink it never showed so i just got up and left. visit lelystad regularly for work but wont go here again.
"i very rarely write negative review but this time, i canât resi "
"good service, mediocre lunch offering, better dinner options. nice view over the marina. we were there for lunch and it was rather quiet but i can imagine it is a vibrant place at night when all people from the boats come in for dinner & drinks. should be nice!"
we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.
they probably took a different road for succ 
"the menus are not in english, but that is ok. what i donât think is ok is having a waitress that doesnât help you find out what you want; asking for fresh bread with butter a side and getting roasts and butte "
terrible service. rude with no smile. didnât allow us to order take out from the restaurant or even to see a menu.  charge money for using the restroom â  no vegetarian options.
"this is not fine dining but you can get a decent meal! i had a steak which was oke, the vegetables and potatoes were nice. one of the better highway restaurants that i have been in. they had a busy night, i could tell, but were still quick and friendly. "
"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajÃ©."
"we went to this place for what we thought would be a quick meal. we ended up leaving without having our bite to eat. the cook seemed totally lost! he would look at the orders and just read them over and over again until finally he seemed to understand what he needed to do. and the place wasnt crowded or anything. many people were just having coffee. we dont know if the food is any good, but service is terrible!!!"
"ok pancakes after visiting the batavia ship, or shopping. the service could be better (forgot about one of the dishes), but the pancakes were ok overall, with interesting topping choices. combines an ice cream shop."
"i received the wrong order and told them not to bother - and accepted it. unfortunately, my partner received his meal 15 minutes later - burned. he sent it back to the kitchen. so instead of having lunch together, we ate in tur "
the place looks nice and clean. we were asked to order some drinks and when our drinks arrived we ordered our foo 
"nice place for lunch or dinner with family and friends. rather good choice of menu and drinken, game room for children. friendly personnel and fast service (however it was rather busy on saturday evening)."
"just outside of batavia stad is this restaurant with a terrace shielded of from the wind, great! food is ok, but not really special. the menu lacks imagination. service is ok, but waitresses prefer to talk with each other instead of looking at the customers"
"the place looks nice but dirty, there were spiderweb everywhere. the service is very bad, we waited long time for our drinks and ofcourse for the dishes too. after we waited around one hour for a lasagna and a caeser salad, we asked the waiter if he can prepare the food for take away. we received a very burned lasagna and a so called caeser salad wich was not caeser at all. we recommend to avoid the place!"
"the food here is fine, and not long waiting time. it is located outside of the mall, so it is fairly relaxed and quiet, which is nice."
"it is a nice place to sit and rest your legs while shopping. service was fast when we ordered lunch and drink. food was good. however, staffs could pay more attention to customers because we tried to order more drink and nobody really looked at us."
"terrible place, ive ordered a sirloin steak without butter. the first time they brought this dish to my friend, although he asked for a ribeye steak and the waiter told him explicitly that this is his dish. after the waiter understood he made a mistake, he ordered a new sirloin dish and brought it with butter although it was explicitly requested without. to summarize do not get near this place. horrible food with bad service from unprofessional team."
"had a coffee here as a cycle trip stop. service ok, drink fine, nothing special, nothing wrong here."
"liked watching people and the town hall from the terrace, price/quality was just ok, nothing special"
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
now this is a really relaxed place very casual they have excellent food and every week they have a changing menu. always friendly people and in the summertime you can even sit outside. not too many tables so during rush hours it might be handy to make a reservation.
"i found this restaurant to be of a reasonable standard. the staff were friendly and efficient and the food provided was of a good standard. i had lamb which i thought was a little over cooked, however , to be fair there were 28 of us eating having not booked. i would recommend a visit ."
"one of the few places open for breakfast (most places donât open till noon). no eggs here, but good coffee, tea, hot chocolate. we had granola with yoghurt and fruit, and some pancakes. good!"
"warning! the restaurant building was interesting, but at the food was delivered haphazardly and without labels, leaving us to figure out what it was. at the end of the average dining experience we were told, much to our surprise, that they do not accept credit card payments. there was no sign at the entrance warning customers of this unusual limitation. so we offered payment by cash card (eftpos) which is a card pre-loaded with cash, so it is the same the same as cash. but they did not accept payment by cash card either. they suggested that one of us could go down the street to an atm cash machine and withdraw the cash to pay for the dinner! we were astounded that such a third-world way of doing business existed in what is supposedly a first-world country. this is not the way that the rest of the western world does business! their uncompromising cash-only attitude ruined the whole dining experience for us, so we had to ask our party of six people if they had enough cash among us to pay in this archaic manner. very embarrassing and annoying. my recommendation: do not go to this restaurant!"
please donât go here. itâs not even close to tapas. everything badly seasoned and served like they put it in a microwave. literally everything i ate was nasty....
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that âitâs an old hotelâ âyou can leave if you wishâ. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: âso my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink 
"this is a stunningly designed restaurant in an old post office. i was dining alone and sitting at a long sharing table. the menu is deceptively big but different dishes for different times of the day, so the choice per meal is small and all tast "
the choices in the menu were very small. if you donât eat meat or fish youâre not able to eat here. fries didnât taste well. and the didnât had the beer on the menu. bad experience.
grand cafe post plaza  in leeuwarden is a nice place to eat and drink. .........clean and cozy.... the price is good and staff are nice and quick service
"after waiting for ten minutes on a dirty table, that was not cleaned yet, we did ask the girl if we could order, she took the tip from the previous people and walked away with our order, but left the table full with the dirty cup "
the place is cozy and very enjoyable with the cat

the male manager was so rude. telling us to leave as soon as we had finished our coffee and threatening us if we didnât. not a relaxed coffee and over priced. do not go!!! ð 
"after being told they couldnât cater for a group of 10, 4 of us sat down for coffee and cake. the waiter was extremely rude on several occasions giving us time limits we had to eat and order more food by. he said if we didnât order more food and drink within 5 minutes he would kick us out (we were the only customers here and had been sat down not even 30 minutes). he spoke to use disgustingly and sarcastically and i wouldnât come back here even if i was paid. he then proceeded to wave his hand and point aggressively into all our faces trying to move us out our seats of which he scared us so we had to leave. over priced arrogant managers - take your money elsewhere as itâs a lovely little town but this guy shouldnât be in public service."
"we stopped at this restaurant for a coffee in the sun. after 30 minutes we were told we needed to order more food or we had to leave. the manager was so rude, intruded our personal space and waited until we left. do not visit this restaurant, itâs overpriced and the customer service is disgusting."
we went to this restaurant during a one day excursion to leeuward 
"this looked a very good bet - well located just to the side of the city centre on an attractive square and with an attractive interior, this was a disappointment. the service was very slow and inattentive...and one point 2 of the service team were sat at the bar whillst we were waiting to have our plates cleared and the whole dinner process became a chore, including even paying the bill which took just so long. the food itself was ok....not outstanding and certainly not good value (expensive for what we received) and the menu and drinks menu was surprisingly restricted. staff were very friendly, i must say, but just the whole system was slow, slow, slow."
"i came across a good deal for this restaurant, which was why we ended up here in the first place because iâd never heard of i "
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but donât order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. âiâll tell the chefâ was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
"bad place, the menu is different from the one in the photo. a waitress spilled sauce on my girlfriend, dirtying her jacket, shirt and trousers. they never apologized or gave any discount, they didnt even ask if they could help. also the meat wasnt good, it tasted like supermarket meat. "
"we booked a table for 5 persons but it was not ready when we arrived. this was a bit disappointing. it is a big place and the staff walks around with headsets which makes it a bit plastic and not personal to my opinion. the steaks were delicious, no doubt. but not a place to go for a romantic quiet dinner, more casual with friends."
"at first glance, a pretty and decent institution. beautiful glass sails create a cozy place. but do not rush! appearance is deceiving and this is the case. the second time i visited this avidion, i was convinced that i would definitely never come back and spend my 1.2 or 100 euros. why??? because, disagreeable service. lack of service. sleepy staff roam the hall, who are too lazy to smile, say hello. by their general appearance and manner of communication, you might think that you came to but to their home and they, giving you a huge favor, gave you tea / coffee / dish. further, on my first visit, the lady waiter 40+ presented me with a bill of vegetarian salad and two beers at 25 euros. at first i paid her in cash, even left a tip for a couple of euros. but after that, i looked in the menu to find out the price of beer. and it turned out that my bill was 20 euros. after discussing this, she returned 5 euros. without saying even sorry. today, i decided to look again at this âfarmerâs denâ hoping to catch a different atmosphere there. and what do you think? at the arena, the same ladies. with the same bias, not a welcoming look and complete antipathy. the only plus for today, did not have to wait a long time for the dish, as the institution was empty. but the bill, i had to wait, because the waiter (the same lady 40+) had a nice chat with the man and without paying any attention to me, demonstrating clearly ignore. she did not pay attention that i had already left the table, went to the cash register and was ready to quickly pay the bill. i was in a hurry, as it was time to run on the train. disgusting staff! disgusting service! complete antipathy to the institution, even in other cities. i will not go to this place even in other cities, and i will never recommend this loetje cafe to my friends / acquaintances / relatives."
 we had to wait ages for our meals and the waiter was not friendly. the food was great though and the ambience is super. but the waiters attitude brought the whole experience down. a sha 
"tasty but. starter was a tomato soup with meatballs. it was ok. after the starters er had to wait a long time before the served the main. i had the walrus burger, tasty but it was red inside. i am normally a guy who order the beef medium rare, but you cant serve a burger that way. that is terrible. for dessert there was ice cream and fruit, it was a generous portion."
de walrus has a nice vibe. outside is a basic seating area and the inside is huge and cozy. food is fine.
the most unusual aspect of this cafe is the way they present copious dishes of rhubarb with every meal despite it often not complementing the dish chos 
"food is okay. staff is very bad, they keep you waiting while they are not doing anything. and seem very grumpy at the table. i had this experience multiple times. by far the worst staff in town."
"the walrus is the big name in leeuwarden for eating and drinking. it occupies two and a half historical building and has a large terrace in front of it. the lunch special was a rather sizeable and tasty meatball for a good price, not bad. they could strengthen the menu a bit in low-carbohydrates and vegetarian options. service is friendly, though a little distracted, and not very fast. it was an irritant that the staff were quite busy rearranging the terrace during lunchtime (12:30) on a sunny saturday. removing gas heaters to be able to draw in the huge parasols, storing stuff right behind our back whilst we were working on the meatball. this could be done more pro-actively earlier i think."
we decided to have dinner here as the menu board at the entrance showed some dishes that would be compatible with certain intolerances we ha 
the service runs entirely via an apple ipod. so chances are that the service becomes impersonal. which is the case and the server blames it on the system! 
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere but when it come to the food we were a bit disappointed. the service was very slow and when we finally received our meals they were just average and therefore a little bit overpriced in my opinion.
since entering the city we had multiple attempts of people trying to get us to have dinner at the walrus. one even offering us free drinks if we di 
"went for the second time a couple of months, with similar experience "
"we visited this place on hemelvaartsdag for dinner and it was very busy. we ordered drinks and they came swiftly. also the food was quick to arrive. the staff is wonderful and very helpful. we had a walrus burger (medium rare), pork fillet sate and 2 salmon steaks. the burger was not medium rare as promised on the menu and the salmon steaks were full of little bones. ok, it is a steak and not a fillet, but still. the sate consisted of large chunks of meat, heavily marinated, but not dry. the sate sauce and atjar were very good. fries were great, salad and fruit compote nice. overall a nice place to have an uncomplicated dinner, but the food can be improved."
"dont get me wrong. this place is solid, but from when i started going there three years ago it lost some of its charm. definitely doesnt deserve the #1 rating it has. again, i still go there but there are other places in town that offer better food (unless youre really into bar food). the beer selection though is great as are the staff and the atmosphere is unique. definitely go, just beware that its not really a #1 pick. "
"very central bar/restaurant. staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is good. menu was very varied, with specials available. the quality was fine and the prices very competitive.  recommended for a quick, basic lunch."
"last night we decided to dinner in leeuwarden. i picked the no.1 restaurant in leeuwarden to celebrate our 2 years relationship. service of the waiters is nice they are really pay attention to the guests. this restaurant really busy in the weekend. i ordered vlees trio but sadly the meat its too cold and the fries also. so i told the waiter and they gave me extra meat and fries, but frankly its almost the same they are not really hot when arrive in to my table. because shortly lots of people coming to dinning the service bit slow, we have to wait 10 minutes for our last coke col "
i was here on a monday night on my own for business. as it was the only restaurant with people on the market near my hotel i choose to have my dinner here. i took a glass of red wine and the tame duck for a main course. quality of the food was oke and the amount was more than reasonable. for the rest nothing special to report.
"nice place and food, super slow service. they have some burgers which, personally i did not find attractive (too greasy, simple, heavy...lets just throw some stuff). i waited for a beer half an hour, literally. and also when we asked for a receipt they were slow. excuse was: it is busy "
very busy restaurant. waiters are nice and friendly. food was not very good. steak was weldone and the other raw.
"i went here with a partner for our first date (long distance relationship) we ordered a platter and it was good but after we paid and left we noticed that the waitress who had been cranky all evening and hadnt even cracked a smile or welcome us had not given us the right change and we wer 13 euros short (hadnt noticed at time as she was rushing us and we never recieved a typical bill she just came up with a bum bag of change and told us the price , no reciept nothing so we gave her the money and worked it out afterwards that we had been short changed and 13 euros is quite alot to lose when theire platters of food is about that mu "
"this bar/restaurant is excellent for drinks, tea and cake (i highly recommend the monchou taart) or lunch but not so much for dinner.  i think the quality of the dishes is okay but not good enough to justify the (high) price."
"the location in the historic centre is great, but the food is bog standard stuff, the staff is efficient but are just that, no attention to their customers, other than the obligatory everything ok?"
the service is great: the waitresses were all very helpful and friendly; they were fast and efficie 
friendly staff and ok food. nice atmosphere. lacking a bit in taste of the food- too nice in a way. would liked the tastes a bit more experimental.
i had the fish & chips which was not very expensive but certainly not a bargain either. for that price i would have expected cod but im pretty sure i got hake. staff is very friendly and there is a wide range of beers to choose from.
"the lunch menu contained beaf, chicken, pork, lamb etc  even after indicating i was vegan and explained what it meant i still got a salad with cheese....  restaurant is nice on the inside and has an old school feel to it."
its a nice place where eat something traditional. always was good and the price was not so expensive. good beers and kindness owner!
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of rÃ©cola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"the menu looks promising, the descriptions enticing, but unfortunately... the meatballs were re-heated in the microwave and some were boiling hot, others were cold and disintegrating. not an experience we would care to repeat."
"went there on a saturday afternoon because of mandatory closing time at 17.00.  food was ok, but service was difficult. gave us the wrong wine (white instead of a red). starters were better than than dinner. portions too big and overall not value for money."
the food was nothing special. the spare ribs were very dry. the environment was average. the stuff were friendly and polite.
"alright, this one isnt easy. let me start like this: we wanted to take the tapas all you can eat formula. after a while, we still didnt get any order lists or something alike, so we asked if we could order our food. seemed that the all you can eat part is eating what they give you. you do not have any choice in the matter at all...none of the waitresses gave us an information about the system when we got the menu, nor any descent explanation later from the boss. âwe make everything freshâ¦â donât they all?! the confusing part is this: nowhere on the menu or on the website they mention that the âall you can eatâ formula isnât free of choice. normally all you can eat is: all you can eat and you pick what you want to eat. i think it is reasonable to assume they work the same way. clearly notâ¦ so on to the next choice on the menu: the five tapas formula for 2 persons. here the same problem: you get the most sold tapas of the month, not the ones you want! soooo extremely frustrating. what if the most sold ones arenât the ones you want?! i mean, seriouslyâ¦at âla cubanitaâ you can order anything you want and as much as you like, now that is an: all you can eat formul "
i went there for dinner with coworkers and was totally grossed out. service is super slow. it took almost 10 minutes to get a menu. i only ordered a salad because i wasnt too hungry. when it came i took one bite and before i could take another i found a massive hairball in the salad. the manager offered me something else but of course i refused to eat anything else out of that kitchen. my coworkers said their food was ok but my experience ruined it. the bright side is the manager told me he didnt charge me for the salad...but he did charge me for the drink. ð would never recommend anybody eat there. 
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description. 
this restaurant was chosen by an opinion gave by the recepcionist from the hot 
"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didnât order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didnât show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."
"i was accompanying my partner for a dinner date he had the planed for. he called to arrange a window view for a romantic sunset dinner, but the staff werenât sure over the phone. when greeted at the restaurant, the seating was denie "

located near the railwaystation but quiet. has a nice terrace. not sure about the food quality. rather mixed opinions. good for a quiet drink on the terrace. the inner room is less cosy.
"this was one of the few places that didnt look too pretentious in the area. it was not too late in the afternoon but the place seemed very quiet. anyway, the waitress was very helpful and we had a good, basic, meal."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
amazing refurbishment!! really nicely don 
went in to ask if i could eat but had no reservation. asked if i could reserve a table and come back after a walk. was welcomed by 3 angry staff/owners. never again.
badly designed and poorly maintained recreation area.
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. itâs okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us â¬ 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly â¬ 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"as the title says. the sausage (rookworst) is awesome. the other food is good, nice and the shop is super-dutch. a must for foreign tourists"
the shop is not very special. quality of products is good but not exceptional. the interior of the store is a not very attractive
lower price range department store... no more and no less.
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
service was good but we were there with a huge group of women and we expected (as the sign said) different bites. the second course waa basically a big bowl of chicken wings. not spanish and 0 inspiration. sad thing. it used to be nice and fun to eat here. this was a shame. 
"i really can not understand why it took so long to get our food, it was a friday night but not at all busy, they got our orders wrong and it was not at all busy, which should have been a sign. the waiter was rude and unapologetic and basically had a crappy attitude. the food was tasteless and it was obvious that the cheapest of the cheap ingredients were used. please do not go to this waste of money. absolutely awful."
"well, what to say? i guess we all know what mcdonalds is, and if you dont, keep it that way. they serve what you call fast food. im not against fast food perse, but it should be nutritious, healthy and well cooked. it was not well cooked, im sorry to say. the burger i had was still on some spots raw and under cooked. toilets were dirty and the personnel were rude and impolite. when i asked for a moment to decide, the lady behind the counter walked away and served someone else. i really need only a second to read the menu. fast food and fast serving. oops. im really sorry, i hoped for a better experience, but unfortunately it was not. next time no mcdonalds."
"generally, i do not recommend american fast food while traveling abroad.  however, if you walk by, go in and get an order of fritz with fritz sauce."
"again i am surprised about all the 5* reviews for this restaurant based on the quality of the food we ate. we arrived without a reservation on a friday night and found a table for two. the vegetarian dim sum is fried and not steamed, which was a surprise but tasted quite good. spring rolls were as you would find anywhere. for the sate main the vegetarian choice was just ok (sauces not that good), but the fish was barely cooked let alone barbequed (see photo with review). i could have done better myself in 15 minutes at home, possibly the trainee chef was on this night. as they seem to specialise in sate i found this top be a poor show. maybe this is a place for meat-eaters as wouldnt recommend for nayone to try."
"basic food, basic service. but not bad! for the price, you get fine quali "

"on the plusside the cafe has a great location on the canal. but when we went there it took 45 minutes to get drinks and 2 hours to get something to eat. and they basically just serve sandwiches and other light meals. maybe they had a bad day, but i wouldnt choose this place if i didnt have alot of time to spend waiting..."

"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
"as a snackbar itâs quite commercially operated and loses the touch with its customers , could do with a lot more personal attention"
"went there with wife while waiting for daughter. very nice drinks, superb upstairs which is probably better to sit in than downstairs. good for people watching."
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
"my wife and i had lunch here, i ordered saltbeef and liver, my wife homemade beef burger. i ask the waitress what sort of liver it was, she asked the chef and he said it was cows liver. to my amazement i received processed liver sausage with big white pieces of fat through out. my wife beef burger appeared to be home made, but was cooked in advance. from the time we ordered our meal to receiving it would not have been long enough to cooked such a big burger, it was just reheated, but not hot enough to melt the cheese topping. i eat my lunch after all it was liver, my wife returned her burger, she was offered an alternative butt by now she had lost her appetite."
"me, the wife and our 6month old baby were looking for a place to eat and according to tripadvisor this was one of the best in sne "
"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if weâd reserve a table for 6:30pm, weâd have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again.

"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."
a group of sailor friends we went to the place last night. the food was just ok but the staff were so uninterested in helping us sort the menu out. we waited a long time to be served and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. when we left there was no good b 
"we ate at this restaurant. it was well recommended by the locals but although the food was was ok, we, found the staff we more interested it ting and talking to their friends at another table than looking after us. there are better places in sneek"
"went with a large group, adults and children. they suggested grown up meals to the children, result a lot of wast "
it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"it is a descent restaurant. good dessert and appatizers. but i ordered the triple meat and got a little piece of steak, a sausage and a piece of chicken fillet. not from the grill. and for â¬ 20,- that not a good dish. cheap meat. for â¬3,- more you have a ste "
"the food and wine here is acceptable and its always busy, but if you offer cocktails on your menu - and charge 8 euros each for the priviledge - then you should at least serve cocktails. we ordered two tom collins. the small glasses were full of ice and half full. we hardly tasted anything. unfortunately horeca in the nl is generally over-priced and substandard. frankly i am more angry with myself that i kept quiet and paid the bill without complaining..."
"service was attentive, but food was just average. nothing special. we were only in sneek for one night and wanted something easy, but id recommend something other than this, just bland pub fare."
this restaurant is more of a bar hangout type of restaurant. serves pricey bar food and drin 
"a nice restaurant with a typical european cuisine. intimate atmosphere, and maybe even a little too dark. nice and helpful employees and big meals!"
always s crowded place. decent but not the best. soup for lunch was adequate but not more than that. a bread dish was a disappointment: expensive for the 2 super market lumps of bread. at least offer good bread if you offer it as a meal on its own. also what we got to put on it was below what we are used being offered in other places.
"the food was good,tasty but a bit overpriced 90 euros for 3.also the service was really slow..almost an hour to get main courses!!the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly"
"we came as a family with two teenagers and a young boy. not much of choice in the menu. the teenagers ate the hamburger that came without tomatoes. the little one ate chichen nuggets. my wife the goats cheese salad and i took the chichen wings. in total an average meal, nothing out of the ordinar "
"i suppose you find this kind of restaurant in every city in europe. though the setting and surrounding is very nice, it is the place for having dinner without having to think too much. menucard comes in 4 languages and plates offered are what you can find everywhere (burger, steak, scampis, etc)."
"nice decor, lovely food, service was not good. way understaffed although the staff were really nice and friendly. 14 or 15 euros for most pizzas or pastas, desserts fairly priced, some starters over priced."
"rude staff, and the boss was just soo rude and doenst give a crap about there costumers. never will come back there. dirty,pricey."
the food was a joke. i realy have never had food that bad. no pation to be found. thatâs all i can say realy.   we ate and left to never return.
terrible service and poor selection choice of food on the menu. the facility was not that great. the waiters were not efficient.
"turned-up for a bank holiday drink and snack. service very slow and unapologetic. some excuses about there only being one cook available. 13,5euro for chicken salad. basic lettuce out of a bag from the supermarket, over-cooked chicken pieces out of the fridge, squirted with some sweet chilli sauce. felt royally ripped-off"
"sat down for a special beer and snacks. nice belgium beers ! mixed deep fried snacks came with just some mustard; after i asked (inside), i managed to get some chili sauce as well.  managed to get some sun on their side terrace."
"the name grandcafe conjures up great expectations, but the menu was no different than any other high street cafe. basic sandwiches and coffe/cappuccino. we had a cup of coffee and my wife cappuccino and went in search of something special."
"at last one sunny day during our holiday in sneek so we decided to go for a drink. the first stop was this place. waiting on the terrasse and trying to get contact with one of the waitresses, or waitres. no chance! busy with doing other things than taking care their customers, so after ten minutes we left."
"we only had a snack here, nachos and chips - they were ample. the menu is only in dutch and the waitress couldnt help much. there is comfortable seating inside and out and the toilets are fine. pruces above average."
i have been there with my girlfriend in a warm day of may. we had an aperitif and the service was good as well as the drinks. good place
had an evening meal here which was ok but compared poorly with our previous meal at the de walrus. the service was good let down by food which while not bad was not memorable. to be fair this was a day when there was a festival in town and they had been clearly busy all day and they were getting ready to shutdown by the time we finished.
"on our daytrip to zwolle and sneek, we made a stopover for drinks at this place. the location is great and the sun was out only the service was slow, we had to find a waitress to order some drinks. thats why we decided to try another place for our dinne "
"only go to this place if you just need calories to keep warm. in that case, this place is sufficient. if you happen to look for a good meal that you can enjoy, you should look elsewhe "
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an âi told you we were busyâ. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
just a normal restaurant with decent food but nothing out of the ordinary. kind staff and the size of the portions are more than sufficient.
"if youre looking for nice solid food, you wont be disappointed here. things like schnitzel, burgers and steak are on the menu."
"this coffee shop is across the plaza from the centrall station and opens early. if you need to catch an early train, or arrive in apeldoorn early, you can find good coffee and breakfast treats at a very reasonable price. the atmosphere is friendly and the food is fresh! its only a few blocks away from the central shopping area."
worst customer service we ever experienced in a mcdonalds. 3-4 employees looking at you waiting to place an order at the mccafe. after several minutes of waiting i decided to place an order at the machine. it took 5 minutes until somebody appeared at the coffee machine despite no other tasks at this point of time for the employees. coffee cooking took another 10 minutes. after completion the two cups were placed on a cupboard to be picked up by another employee. additional 2-3 minutes waiting time while most employees were just doing nothing. of course the two cups had no marking indicating what the cappuccino and what the latte machiatto is. overall highly disappointing and badly organized. the management needs to start working on a lot of issues in this restaurant.
"had a mckroket; those are interesting. a pretty standard mcdonalds with free wifi and decent service, but they have the machines at the front so you dont have to interact with anyone if you dont want to, you asocial silly person. :)"
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had satÃ©. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "
"we were in 20 people, ordered different dishes, starters and desserts. i ordered risotto with forests mushrooms and.. it was really bad risotto with champignons.. and frozen asparagus. bad taste, too salty. forests mushrooms only from bullion cube. not worth that price. my boyfriend ordered duck, which was also not so tasty. too chewy and without duck tas "
"my husband and i visited in the opening month. we were quite disappointed and would much rather have a very tasty burger for half the price at finnegans pub in the center. food was edible though, but we wont be visiting aga "
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.

"what a waste. no way she was going to serve me a cup of tea âno way sir, not my jobâ and serving me a kroket that was rotten: âyes sorry, i already thought it was offâ. if i was the owner i would be ashamed. but apparently they completely lost it, donât care anymore and you as a customer should not care either. donât go. there is tons of places in the area that love to serve with a smile and deserve your money more then ever."
"we were there in february for a business / relach dinner ... nice place, cosy place, fresh food, nice drinks ... but can only be considered as exceptionnal, fabulous, fantastic,  "
"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "
"being the most busy terrace at the square, we choose for jules verne. a friendly guy guided us to our table, which he cleaned with a wiping cloth. during our dinner we learned that this wiping cloth doesnt get cleaned! he used it at every table time after time "
"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"not for fine dining, but if you are hungry and want some schnitzel, fries and beer in a comfortable setting in central apeldoorn, you will be happy you came here."
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"i believe several times i consumed a drink, a smoothy, or a coffee, or a hot chocolate, for it looks hip, that restaurant, or has organical products, american quality, but i dont get the things done, that need to be done, its all waste of time. and it costs money, all those things do, and i dont make any friends, anemies, yes. "
"it is a pity that the brick and mortar shops nearby are empty, for rent. the street with the outside tables is not lively. service is fine. food is good."
nice coffee and a relaxed entourage. we did only some drinks but the menu looks great and tasty. one small comment: there was no baby changing place.
"this place is nothing special: just a corner restaurant where you can get bagels (different varieties with different toppings), juices, coffees. bagels are good though, served warm. several kinds of cream cheeses to choose from too. all in all nice place for lunch if you dont want anything fancy."
arriving at 18.00 with a group of

"this mac is not very big allot of trash outside but this can be a moment moment. the food is normal like any other mac so enjoy. your close to the highway so you can go east, west, north and south."
got here with a voucher of vakantieveilingen. three course menu. as starter we had the fungi and carpacio both very tasty. we both enjoyed the main salmon course with fries and salat. we finished with ice and baklava. serving staff is a bit slow and the restaurant is a bit on the sober side. also the marktstraat is not the prettiest street of apeldoorn. good value for money though!
"nice place, not a huge selection on the menu but enough for a nice lunch. went there with my mother and they were willing to change her selection so she could eat it more easily as shes handicapped."
"nice pub, visit it often for drinks and sometimes to have a nice me "
told us to leave because we were having a good time cat was on the bar got upset when we stroked it dont go here owner is miserable
after a lovely day all around the apenheul monkey enclosure. we decided to eat lunch. we both ordered a beef burger. i cut mine in half to see red raw meat and it was stone cold. sent it back to kitchen and it came back to me again raw. donât waste your money here. far to expensive.
"actually, this is a nice place in a nice setting on the edge of a park, overlooking a lake. more of a nice lunch venue than a dinner setting, with a pleasant terrace if the weather is fi "
"nice place for coffee or lunch, but not for dinner. great location, nice vuews, good service if not too busy."
visited after a day of apenheul. tries to be haute cuisine and comes very close. could be bigger portions for these prices.
we called to book and were told that we could reach without any problem: once we arrived the lady told us that she had received no call and that there was no availability. quite shocking to receive such rudeness after having travelled to reach the place.

"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"
"driving along the road into town a big sign in front of the restaurant xl steak â¬17.95. sounds fine. checked on the menu at the entrance: again xl steak â¬17.95. we ordered 2 of those. nice big steaks, modest portion french fries, tiny portion sauce. no garlic butter as promised on the menu. as desert caramel coupe, described as vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and pieces of chopped caramel. the ice cream was very soft and the caramel sauce missi "
"very average food, in an average hotel. staff friendly, but poor quality food for a four star hotel. dinner and breakfast both over-priced for quantity and quality. go just up the road to restaurant de heerlijckheyt het loo, and youll get a much better meal."
"the two other top rated restaurants in apeldoorn were fully booked so we fell back on the navet, rated #3. while the food was generally good, each dish of the 3-course menu was over-complicated. no wonder it took ages for the cooks to prepare them. also, the alsatian pinot gris flavour was off as it had obviously been kept for too long (375ml bottles do not keep well). the last straw was when we were charged a supplement of 17 eur for two small pieces of veal sweetbread which had been offered without information about the cost. its a shame how these small details can ruin an otherwise positive experience."
"it was a take-away hot chocolate, i didnt consume on the terrace, which looked nice enough, because i also feel the need to smoke a sigarette, when i consume such a drink, but i think the wheather was to bad, to much wind, so i consumed it somewhere else."
nice please to hang a round to haven an easy meal with a couple of drink.the haven open towards 6 oâclock in the event (18:00)
we sat down for a quick lunch at this place. the tomato soup took for ever to arrive.   i had one beer and was never asked if i would like another. waving didnât help either!
"very slow & we had a very unprofessional waiter. even with a half empty restaurant. thankfully, food was tasty when it arrived. will not be going back"
"location very nice got outside table, with perfect view of square.  omelet cold and greasy. not able to cafe latte eith lowfat milk. service friendly - but had to wait for service - even very few guests."
"we went here late one afternoon and quickly found a seat. we had planned on just having a drink but as we stayed longer decided to be lazy and have food as well. we had the house red wine to drink, which was nice and at â¬11 per small carafe good value. for food we had vlammetjes to share, i settled on the satay java and my mum on the vissersverdriet. my satay was bone-dry, there was one piece of kroepoek (prawn cracker) and the rest of the plate was just filled with chunky chips. my moms vissersverdriet was smoked salmon on toast, nothing more then that. she even stated that the cucumber seemed to be missing. not worth the price. well stick to drinks the next time we visit. although the vlammetjes were lovely."
"we were in apeldoorn for an antique market, and it was time to eat something. we had a choice of restaurants to go to, and we chose this one because its menu included uitsmijters...a favorite of mi "
"stopped here on a sunny weekday afternoon to have a drink on the terrace in the summer sun. the ambiance was really nice on the square next to the old town hall, with its carillon bells going of regularly. the service was prompt, friendly and appropriate with a good attitude towards me, my wife and my toddl "
"so we cycled to apeldoorn and sat a grand cafÃ©, at the moment we came in some people where just about to leave their table at the window. perfect we thought so we can keep an eye on our bikes. their cups and glasses where still on the table but we did not bother, because we expected they would be taken away immediately by the waiter. after a few minutes (5 or so) a waiter comes and we order two cappuccino and both a piece of apple cake. after 7 minutes or so we finally get our cappuccinos in glasses which where not washed very well. (meanwhile the other glasses are still on the table) the waiter goes away, and we assume he is going to get the apple cake. but no, he starts hanging out with the other waiters. after 5 minutes we finally get our apple cake. that took long, but they had most likely put it in the oven to warm up a bit. noooo the ice crystals almost on there that cold it was. we where lucky an other waiter spotted the other glasses and finally took them away. for >10 euros we expect a bit more, it does not have to be perfect but a clean cup would have been nice. and in winter you do not serve cold apple pie."
"needed to go into apeldoorn center to buy some gifts.   was a bit hungry and tried de notaris.   simple dishes, but okay.   maybe more suitable for a drink."
"service was poor, too few staff for a busy evening. food wasnt bad, but have waited for it a bit too long. as you get your printed bill after you pay i didnt notice they put one extra drink i didnt have on it. not good, will not go there again, definitely not recommended."
we were there with seven friends and had a fine dinner and a good time! the place is small but nice. normal prices.
"waited 45 minutes for appetisers to arrive. after 1 hour and 40 minutes our main courses had still not arrived so we paid our bill and left. the place was busy but this was really unacceptable - it appeared that the kitchen could not keep up with the number of diners, who are packed into the restaurant with very little space. the appetisers we had reflected the menu, rather old-fashioned heavy french food, and the bread served at table was stodgy white supermarket style baguette. disappointing!"
was there for the first time and invited by a friend. the regular cook seems to be ill for a long time and the kitchen is managed by juniors it seems not knowing how to fry ossenhaaspuntjes. the aspergus soup was fine and the cheese as desert ni 
price-quality fair. due to misunderstanding (....) we have waited more than an hour for starters. nice ambiance. recommended.
i ate here. it looked cute and it was very busy. 
i had a business dinner in this restaurant. outside was terribly cold with snowy. but i liked athmosfer in this place with kind waiters..
"the food at parthenon was far too salty, not big on seasonings, and over-priced for what you got. the atmosphere is nice and the staff competent, but the food left a lot to be desired. if you want good greek food in the netherlands, make the effort to go to akropolis restaurant in alphen aan den rijn."
"as lovers and consumers of greek food on a regular basis, i could say that although the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was good and friendly, the food was mediocre. no real greek taste to anything, nothing traditional, just very plain tasting dishes. also quite pricey for a greek restaurant! the tzatziki had no bite to it, there was no pita or oven bread available, desert was dull and tasteless and the meat and sea food had nothing greek about them. disappointed - will not return!"
"the waiter probably doesnt know how to cut cheesecake, there wasnt part of it and half of pinta of beer costed 4.5 â¬ which wasnt in menu (winter beer)"
"we ate with colleagues as a christmaslunch. for my colleagues the portions were to big so they ordered sides as a main, and all was good, no problem. it took a while and when the meals came, some of them were not really hot anymore, but thats why i reviewed it as average and not good. iff the meals come warmer then they would get four stars ;-)"
"based on our experience just a month ago we decided to go for some decent pub food once more, but were disappointed. the lambsstew was this time watery, the steak too salty, and the waitress by no means as friendly as last time. was it our lucky day a month ago - or was this time the exception?"
"atmosphere is good, what youd expect of an irish pub. staff was ok, but not very fast.  food was very average. wouldnt recommend eating here."
"lovely terrace, descent food, chaotic service. i.e. go for lunch or a drink when the weathers fine - but expect slow service."
"nice place in the center of town. former school of music. on sunny days one of the favorits with locals, because of the big terrace with loung style seats. good spot, but for a beer or so, not for food; menu consists mosly of overpriced snacks and bites. staff sometimes seems more interested in eachother than in their guests"

"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."
"the concept of this location is based on offering a nice space to work, together with good drinks, and offering some meals as wel "
"simple good food, no more no less,  sufficient choice and good to get you going for a long walk and/or ride by bike"
we waited one hour to place our order. then we simply gave up and decided to stick around in the sun (still no one helping us). we talked to four different people in the staff who kept saying âsomeone will come in a minuteâ or âplease wait a few minutesâ. some staff completely ignored us when we asked for help. terrible. unfortunately not many options considering this is a national park.
we have been passing by to have a beer after our bike ride and even after 40 minutes we did not get a waiter to take an order. we went inside and they told us to wait outside at the table and also contacted 4 staff outside. nothing. very bad service.
"from the outside the place looks ok, but when you enter it doesnt feel like a restaurant at all. more like a cafeteria in a retirement home. very old and ugly and not a good atmosphere. the price of the food and drinks is too high for the quality. such a shame because its a great locatio "

"the staff are not the most attentive ot customer centre focused. upon arrival, i was ignored and not welcomed. i could on your staff twice but was promptly ignored until i raised my voice far above what is normal and socially expected. we were eventually led to our table. we were the first ones to arrive however the last ones to be served. customers came after us and were promptly given a drink, orders takenâ¦.i had to shout to one of the ladies serving everybody else, who seemed to be ignoring us. normally at a restaurant, staff members will come and ask you, is there anything i can get you, without the customer always having to attract attentionâ¦.anyways this was not the case. i am also very dissatisfied in the food. i had an octopus salad which literally was cumber, tomatoes and onion with canned octopus ðð¾ my 12 year old daughter could make a more creative octopus salad than that. the only thing that was nice was the view. the customer services was poor and the food was average. the only thing that happened quickly was the staff bringing me the bill to pay. the experience left me wondering if it was because i am black that i was treated soo poorly, as none of the other customer who were white had to shout for attention ð¤·ð½ââï¸"
"was ok, staff is very friendly but the portions were huge and the food was quite salty and all tasted the same. we had a family style dinner and it tasted unremarkable."
"we were with a group of 8 and they suggested a shared platter. the amount of food they brought was ridiculous, it was way to much! food was ok but bland. we were full after the first course and the second course was even more. in the end the bill came to over 500 euro for 8 people. way to much. "
in this restaurant you can have a good greek meal. lunch or dinner. it is a cosy restaurant for families and coupes.
"i have been there on the first night of my stay in arnhem. functional position, just few steps away from the station.  souvlaki just tasted normal. the place is a bit too tawdry for my taste.  average prices."
"visited with grandparents and teens. we all could chose and ate with pleasure. greek is about cheese, thats what i remember most. and there s a limit for me. but that is my taste."
3 of us booked a table 6.00 we ordered 2 pizzas and a starter it was a mess we orderd a wine each. while we were waiting...and waiting and waiting!!! our bill was 70 euros mostly for the wine.. we were shocked.. girls were very nice but kitchen was chaos.. it took 2 hours before we got our dinner..also no anchovis..no green olives... never again!!!
"waiting for 1,5 hours and still the pizza wasnt the "
we went here with a group of 8. we got a table all the way back at the restaurant. lets say it was not the most cosy place they could give u 
"for this occassion we ate from the special ah-spaarkaart menu. luckily this did not mean that there was hardly choice. still we could either chose from this menu or a pasta / pizza. well done! good taste. my oven roasted chicken was delicious, bit cheesy though. "
"pastas is ok. doesnt taste like pastas in italy. staff are kind and helpful, cousy and easy to find from central station. toilets are clean but old and a bit messy. prices are reasonable."
"what do you expect from the pizza chain? a decent pizza at a good price. pasta dishes also available, but i did not have that. the pizza is exactly what you would expect."
"it is cheap; too cheap to make an eatable pizza obviously. the bottom is prefab; tasteless. topping of tuna: dry and no taste. no herbs, nothing. to add some flavour. my wifes pizza was little better."
tried here once very noisy and very very cramped more a young crowd place food was food nothing to talk about we will not be back
visited november 2013. english is spoken and there are english menus availab 
"we went with 4 friends to eat some tapas at la puerta. it take a considerable time before you get something to eat or drink. once they served the dishes, most of these dishes seemed like these were not freshly prepared or the dishes were cold. the only that makes this restaurant interesting is the location, the basements of arnhem."
the food is good here and a nice price. but i would prefer la cubanita (not so far away from this restaurant) to eat tapas.
"great for sharing food. most of it was nice, but used to be better. i was really looking forward to the spareribs, unfortunately they were a bit dry. but other than that, it was a great night out."
the worst caesar salad ever! the sauce was definitely doubled with tap water. barely anything in the plate for 14 euros. what a joke.
stunning ambient lighting but closed early on the monday night that we visited. nice enough for a beer...
"the service is nice but not that smiley and the terrace is charming. but the lasagne was a little bit burned, the chicken wrap was missing some taste, tabasco was 1 year overdue and therefore only poor review."
my favorite part of le bon vivant was the atmosphere. the ambiance was very quirky and charming - full of amusing items to ponder. there was no english on the menu so we had to do our own interpretations however we were able to find something to order. the staff was not very attentive and the food was pretty good but we probably would not return.
"nice location for watching people and vibe on jansplaats. average sandwiches, good coffee, indifferent service."
"we would like to eat with the family there. our daughter has food allergy. the menu card has no information about what is in any dish. the first reaction was that it would be okay. inquiry revealed that what our daughter was allergic to was in a sauce. after consultation with the chef, who repeatedly looked at our daughter very annoyingly, the message was that there was no replacement sauce, whereas so far every restaurant in the netherlands had done that smoothly. drink drank and left quickly"
"we were looking forward to a nice dinner al fresco and as most restaurants were full, we gave the bon vivant a try. nice location and kind service, but truly horrible food! tasteless, endless use of the same ingredients, no correlation between what the menu said it would be and what actually materialized. heaps of chopped lettuce hiding cheap salmon, drenched in greasy sauces straight from the bottle....all in all disappointin "
"fantastic food for good value, located nicely for lunch on the terras in the sun, but sadly the waitress waiting us was terrible and extremely rude!"
nice but nice is very average food was ok but expensive for what we had. staff were very good but there are a lot of better cheaper places
we had dinner at le bon vivant on thursday 9th october. the place looks really nice inside and the waitresses were very friendly and helpful! the meals were generous but this is where the positive feedback sto 
"first and last at the so-called bon vivant in the center. slow service and horrible frozen food. we asked for a schnitzel and got the cheapest kinda chicken nugget you can find. and the fries were awfully salty, barely edibl "
"lots of restaurants in downtown arnhem. this french style restaurant offers a number of more or less standard french and mediterranean dishes. the ambiance is pleasant, they have a small terrace. the restaurant was pretty windy and the staff closed the windows when it was really necessary. french, just not too loud music adds to the french style. no haute quisine, but a good problemless place to come back to, as we actually did. the restroom is rather narrow, well, that can happen with very old houses!"
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."
"if you do not like the combination of rare french fries with mayonaisee, do not go to this restaurant. again, we have the reunie and we spent tea time, lunch and dinner at tr "
"we were five: two adults, one child and two babies. the service at the beginning was pretty good, the waiter explained everything but the main course came after 30 minutes. the waiting was too much since we ordered steak, fish, two chicken nuggets and the restaurant was empty. only  "
visited again after 2 years because in the summer of 2017 we liked the place and the food and ate here 2 nights in a ro 
"ive been at pinoccio during a business trip, advised by loca "
we have been coming to this restaurant for many years on our annual visit to arnh 
"if you want a quick pizza or pasta you can have it here. do not expect the best of food. it is a cosy restaurant near to shops, cinema and theater."
"its a cheap pizzeria and you get your value for money. a fine place for a catch up with friends, without breaking the bank."
rubbish rubbish rubbish and more rubbish the food was tasteless cannot think of anything good to say about it
"i went here with my partner because it is a famous place for pizzas. i will never come back. the pizza didnÂ´t have any cheese and when we complain about it the service was really rude to us. the local is big but they put too many people and tables next to each other, you canÂ´t eat confortably. i will not recomend this place,"
ok this place is cheap and convenient but quality is quite low. our pizzas were rather tasteless and the dough is clearly neither homemade nor properly baked. and why would you add fat on the crust to make it shine? this is nowhere to be found in italy and only makes pizzas look greasier than they are. add slow service and you wont get the romantic dinner you were expecti 
we took time to relax in the shadow of st eusebius church with a few drinks from arnhems meisje. service was swift and the restaurant is in a good location not far from the hub of the old town. a standard but pleasant experience.
good place to have a drink in the sun. good food that is an ok price. good place to meet someone for lunch.
there are many more restaurants serving poor quality food for regular prices. but here they add abominable service and disrespect for free. what a bummer!
"well what can i tell you about my experience at this cafe bar. firstly i placed two hours parking on the meter a short (spitting distance) from the cafe, at the cost of approximately Â£5. (not their fault i grant you) we were sat to a table by a friendly waitress, who then walked off as though sitting to the table was all we had come to do. five minutes past and another friendly waitress attended our table and handed us menus and took our drinks order. two lattes please. these duly arrived at our table within an acceptable time, and we had time to browse through the menu. which really was like putting computer binary in front of me, as the whole thing was written in dutch. no translation. i did think im in holland why would they have the menu in english and fair enough i agree, but then a vast majority of the patrons sat around us were also english, all with furrowed brow trying to look like they understood what was written on the menus in hand. (its a point, is al "
after dinner drinks and coffee with the four of us. staff is full of pretence and annoyingly fake-jovi 
"nice place, very nice terrace, nice fingerfood, nice beer, but the wine is terrible. we tried the pinot grigio, the verdicchio and the sauvignon blanc and they all tasted like acid. this is the worst quality wine you buy in the supermarket and is a bloody shame that they sell this wine. so, if you go, drink a coke or a beer, but forget the wine!"
"in this small street there is this restaurant with two separate locations. we were in the garden, so nice! the staff is friendly and attentive."
"i normally love this place, great atmosphere and food. yesterday we went there with friends. the food was good but the service and staff where terrible! from the start we got the feeling of not being welcome. cold staff, candles where not replaced and they started cleaning around 2230 hrs (vacuum cleaner put in sight etc). i hope it was a one off... "
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
"the restaurant has a large terrace which is great during warm days. the card is rather limited which is a pity, just a bit more choice would have made it more pleasurable. very friendly personnel which is a big plus!"
"of all the places ive eaten so far in arnhem, this was one of the most unimaginative places....  too bad.. my grandmother opened this spot............. all 8 of us were looking at each other and shaking our head...."
"as a local i got here with a friend of mine for a beer after we had dinner somewhere else. this is has been an item for years in the city of arnhem, but i wonder for how much longe "
"i have been here with a friend for an informal dinner. it was goed, nothing extraordinary but for sure above the average of a dutch eet-cafÃ¨. the veggie burger was awesome! price/ quality was also ok. if you are in arnhem, dont forget to stop here."
"we started off with a mix of small dishes (gozo, sashimi, yakatori) and then i had the fish of the days (sea bass) and my wife had tuna. both fish dishes were ok, but were accompanied only by a small salad garnish and some fried potatoes. so it was a bit boring. but from my experience at eating in arnhem to date, none of the restaurants seem to have imaginative menus."
found this place on tripadvisor and gave it a try as we were in the area. i was totally disappointed. came into the restaurant and the waitress asked what we wanted. a table obviously? service was slow and the food wasnt good. very tiny restaurant/cafe. i dont know why this restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants in arnhem. decided not to go for the main course here and asked for the bill. the staff were eating and didnt want to get up to give us the bill. had to go up to their table to ask. ridiculous. never again. 
the restaurant looks nice but we were lucky not to get a table in the basement. be sure if you book a table. the waiters are more busy talking to their kitchen colleagues than paying attention to the guests. when arriving at 17:15 (we did not book a table)there was a slight panic like they were expecting 100 people. at the time we left 2 hours later the place was not full yet. the food took very long. starter and main course in almost 2 hours.... dishes are average. we had to ask twice for the chefs dishes mentioned on the menu.
"having read the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, we were expecting great things from graave â we were disappoint "
having read good reports about this place we were very dissapoint 
"very nice meal, but terribly slow. 90 minutes to be served an appetizer and hamburger. waiter charming and most helpful in choices."
my wife and i ate here while we were visiting arnhem over the weekend for our trip to national park de hoge veluwe. id specifically picked this restaurant for its rating on tripadviso 
liekd the atmosphere and style. disliekd that i wasnt served within reasonable time. actually just drank and left although i wanted to have dinner.
"so they advertise with all you can eat. so from the outside it looks quite inviting. so youre hungry. walk on. because as soon as youve decided to sit down and order anything, the waiting game starts. it takes them around 30 mins to serve you another helping of the all you can eat skewers. and they are badly cooked... i mean badly. no seasoning, burnt on the outside, tiny little quantities of meat hidden between big chomps of union. after more than two hours and forking out eur 40 per person we left hungry and frustrated. never again."
"probably the worst meal i have had in arnhem. i order the prawns to start, and received a very small shrimp in sauce dish for 9.95 euro. at bill time i was asked how the meal was, i explained the starters was disappointing, the response was its shrimps, you should have looked at the menu better. the menu states in de oven gebakken garnalen met een groente roomsaus which to me translates to prawns. and at 9.95 euros prawns is what are to be expected. never to return. "
"came here with my husband and dad, but this time the standard dropped. the food is dull and all we liked was the bread with sauce. disappointed with the results. will think twice to come back. this was our favourite turkish restaurant as i have been there for many years. "
"we went there on a saturday night, not too busy and a very good service. the restaurant looks beautiful with its classic atmosphere, the food on the other hand is good but not amazing, i didnt enjoy too much the pasta crepes (if i had read the menu with more attention i wouldnt have taken the risk) while the picassos chicken had a perfect sauce with an amazing flavor, but the chicken itself was not cooked good enough. my girlfriends dishes were looking better to be hones "
have used this bistro many times in the past when coming to arnhem for the para reunion...but tonight the food was awful...the service was really bad..i have always recommended this place to others...but not no more and i will not be returning in the future.
"if you want something that tastes worse than the cafeteria around the corner and pay about the same.. go here. dry (to long baked) meat, burned and/or overcooked sides.. for simple dishes i can cook at home i expected more. got a glass of wine thrown over me and an apology would not have been misplaced. ive been here a second time to not misjudge the first visit, what a waste of time and money... there are far better restaurants in arnhem that are actually worth visiting, skip this one if you want a descent night out!"
we sat outside with a few drinks and the local men were really rude and sexist to women walking past. not nice. it maybe old cafe but could do without the misogyny and comments.
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"almost at the center of the beautiful presikhaaf park you find this small restaurant. you can have lunch here outside in the sun or inside if thats what you prefer. the prices are low because some off the staff have an working disability, this sometimes can cause funny situations so know where your going! i find it a very nice place, hope you enjoy it to as well as the park and the small farm for children."
"it was good. the food choice is not extremely various but is very different from any other standard dutch bistrot. mostly vegetarian and unusual dishes (which i liked), the service was just a little slow and some improvement here would be appreciated."
"very good and friendly service, good location. restaurant offers a nice atmosphere, however the burgers are not that goo "
there is no options for people with allergies in their main menus and so we werent able to eat the burger. staff didnt seem faced with it either.  beware of that before you plan your visit
"the place is nice, good ambience but i didnt like the burgers that much. meat was too cooked and expensive for nothing especial."
"range of burgers, certainly no high cuisine. for a burger place not cheap, but much better then burgerking and mcdonalds."
"i have visited iveau burgers and wijn and ordered a gamba burger, which is the most expensive one, because i love prawns and i wanted to have a very nice lunch for my birthday, the price is â¬16,75 that made sure it was going to be a really tasty and delicious burger, i already had other burgers for less price in other places, so i had big expectations!! "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"i got here with a friend. he had been here before and suggested to only take a main course because the portions are quit big. he didnt lie! we had the meat platter for 2 and it was a little struggle but i finished it, or we both did;). so on the house you gt some fresh bread with garlic sauce, delicious! service is okay and the tasted of the food is go "
"if youre looking for a lot of food for little money, definitely go here! i looooved the bread, still warm mjum. after that it was ok. everybody has always told me how great the food is, so i will go back someday to try it again. the goat cheese salad had too much of everything and was way to big as a starter, but it did look pretty. i didnt even finish the pizza (which is a first for me), cause i was full after the bread and salad and the pizza wasnt great. the bottom was very thin but unfortunately not crispy. the mixed grill contained 5pieces of meat, most of which were nicely cooked, but because its so much, the last pieces are already below temperature when you start eating those. staff wasnt great either. we only had one drink cause nobody was near us. after they cleared the table when we finished, nobody asked us if we wanted dessert or coffee/tea. until we grabbed our coats and asked for the bill (we had waited at least 20min). i guess they had an off-day. so am hoping for better luck next time :)!"
in the past i really enjoyed this place but our last visite was an awfull experience. greazy pizzas and bad service.
friendly staff however the food was only so so. a bit burned. and the meat felt it was rushed. i was disappointed maybe it is better now since some time has passed.
"the owner refused to let us in. when she saw the two baby pushchairs, it was completely impossible to have lunch. although the restaurant was almost empty. unbelievable..."
"what an old biddy that runs this place. rude beyond description. walked in with my husband and was glared at by some old woman behind the bar. we went in for a coffee. eventually she came over, my husband orders coffee, but i wanted an americano as the coffee is too strong for me. my husband goes up to the counter to change the order and the old bat got flustered beyond belief saying she doesnt speak english. fine...my husband tried to explain in dutch. she wanted none of it. she brings a regular espresso type coffee and then he explains again that perhaps the glass they serve tea in along with some hot water would be possible? she had a dam fit! all the while saying she doesnt speak english and was visibly annoyed. i did end up with more hot water. we did need more milk and my husband went to ask for more. she said she already gave us some and was very annoyed. after we were done, my husband, whose roots are dutch with all relatives being dutch, went up to pay and said nicely in his broken dutch that he was trying to communicate with her in dutch and she was very rude. she said she did not care and he did not know how to act in a restaurant in holland and that dutch is the language of holland and we should know how to speak it. she said she ran the place for 54 years and it was her place and we should learn how to act properly in a restaurant in the netherlands. never have we come across someone so rude. ok that she obviously doesnt like foreigners, but why have a restaurant. time for her to retire. we have never met such a rude individual and our dutch relatives and friends are not even close to this way of thinking. will never ever go back and we hope people will refrain from giving her business. avoid at all costs. she was also visibly rude to other guests that were there."
very bad experience provided by the old lady serving. felt uncomfortable and unwelcome by her. she should retire!
"we wanted to eat at a local place and decided to eat here because the menu at the door looked very enticing. unfortunately the reception was icy and the service was slow and uninterested. got the drinks wrong, meat was well done and not rare. were not offered more drinks or desserts. very disappointing."
we have been here for lunch on the 2nd of january. the staff was friendly and the food was o 
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay â¬ 50 each. would not really recommend it."
"service was ok and the establishment seemed to be run with teenaged staff. the food was ok but lacked seasoning, and the salad was very oily. my husband said the pizza was good."
"after reading the excellent reviews on tripadvisor we decided to try this place out. the place looks nice: clean, a sunny terrace surrounded by greenery, kind staff, and very family- and dog friend "
"when you mix perfection with imperfection, the results are imperfect. thats unfortunately my experience with this little plac "
"great food (try their amazing bitterballen) and beer. unfortunately, there wasnt an english menu and not all the waiters were able to translate some things to us. our orders got lost twice, so it took more time than expected to get our food."
"the ambience is amazing, the club sandwich fish was equally amazing. i like that i was able to choose between soy and oat milk. in general all good...but the owner genuinely needs to scold her staff in private, it is beyond awkward to have to listen to when having a romantic lunch."
"this little patio has a great atmosphere. you can sit here to hide from the sun or rain. it is a cosy place. so for a dink, perfe "
"nice place, good coffee and but dry  cakes. we had good bread dish realy good comes with some adds.  location is good and nice place to have break. they have a game that not accept master card......  so its tricky....   skip this place"
"this used to be a really nice cafe. been there recently, it was busy with too little staff. since the food i wanted was only available after 3pm, i asked the waitress for other recommendation and she got upset. as you can guess, the atmosphere was ruined. food was average too, i dont think i will be back anytime soon. disappointed."
dont bother... it was quick yet not vwry tasteful.. skip this place. dont know how many words to use.
"situated at a crossing point of 5 shopping streets. approx 17 tables outside served by 1 person.  friendly guy. menu is variated. wine beer. several types of tea, salads and beverages."
"this small cafÃ© has an informal atmosphere. itâs at a nice location in the city centre, and thereâs outdoor seating as we "
"this is seriously the worst service mcdonalds of all time. slow, slow , slow...food almost always cold ....and rarely do they get the order right! its mindboggling that they get it wrong so often. this week i went there three times..and yep, they got the order wrong all three times..i guess its difficult to distinguish between coffee and tea. always 2- 3 managers  working at one time, but literally doing nothing. if you go through the drive thru, be prepared to wait forever..its quicker to fly to america then get your order here this way...and good luck getting what you actually ordered...this is the worst mcdonalds ever!"
"we visited the restaurant on a sunday evening. when we arrived at 17.30 it was still quiet but when we left at 20.30 it was packed. the interior is trendy and warm. i liked it a lot. cosy atmosphere, interesting men "
"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress Ã¼ber-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
they got my order wrong twice. no english menus. all they did to make it better was just a free cup of tea. the food itself was basic and subpar.
"my wife and i both had a burger here, they were very nice but they were on the small side, 2 burgers and 4 glasses of orange juice cost almost â¬30,00. after we left here we went to the nearest cake shop to top ourselves up."
"we ordered our food before we came and waited 1,5 hour for it. it took 45 minutes before they let us order our drinks and then the food came separately. very bad experience"
"we visited fika several times. if you want to have a good coffee in nijmegen , in my opinion this is a very good place to start. they have a very good coffee blend from a nijmegen roastery. along with the coffee we had a brownie - not recommended, it was like a piece of shoe sole... the personnel is okay, but nothing special. the place itself is not very nice, but is central. it tries to get a bit of a swedish style, but is just a place where the owners didnt want to invest money and this is why this location is missing the atmosphere... no background music, no colours for the walls, some basic metallic shelves (by basic, i really mean basic-like that the people putting in their garages or basements), white tiles on the wall like in a communist butcher shop. pity, this place could be something much more than that with a few more money spent for improvements - some pale neutral colours on the walls, some new industrial style shelves for the bar, some new design lamps, some music... "
"we got 3 of what they call smorrebrod on a menu with shrimp, ossenhaas and tuna. all three were very good sandwiches, but clearly the owner/cooks/waiters have no idea what a smorrebrod actually is. so food is good, but not as advertised. we had to wait more than 40 min for sandwiches. coffee was good"
"after shopping and ice skating we met at le duc for an afternoon snack. the place is clean and looks friendly comfortable. 3/5. the service is efficient and friendly. 4/5. we ordered green pea soup 3/5, bitterballen set 4/5, tok tok (chicken nuggets + fr. fries.) 3/5, white wine 4/5, green tea 3/5."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.
there are a lot of great restaurants in nijmegen. this is not one of th

we went here to have lunch with the family group. we had ordered drinks beforehand and unfortunately after waiting a long time my cousin received a lukewarm coffee and my other cousin had to ask twice for his beer. as it wasnt included when the drinks were brought to our tab 
"really slow and bad service. we waited for almost an hour for all our orders. the waitress forgot to tell us that our order wasnt possible, so we found out by accident that we were waiting in vai "
they forgot my order. my mate was long done with his pizza before my pasta arrived. the pasta itself was also terrible. not recommended
the best thing about this spot is that it has good atmosphere and is cosy and warm (in cold or rainy day). food was average compensated partly by friendly waiters. it seems to be popular place as it was very busy. it is about one street away from the marketpla 
"service was quite slow, pizzas average and had toppings not included on the menu(not great if you dislike capsicum) and charged 7 euro for some bread to start, which, given itâs an italian restaurant, i would have thought was free or at least way less than a pizza! disappointing experience, will be sure to explore another option next time. "
"after 4-5 minutes waiting at the door to get seated (as the sign says) and a few eye contacts met the waiters, we left. it was about 60-70% full on a saturday afternoon, not a super busy period. iâm willing to wait longer for a table, but i donât like to be ignored. doesnât really work well in the hospitality business..."
"well, i should be honest and fair. pizza is a kind of âroma styleâ, so dough is very thin everywhere, and this was the case. ingredients were not tasty at all, not easy to feel cheese or ham or salami taste. the problem was that, this combination had a bad digestive consequences, that means cheese was not ok and dough not well don "
visited this restaurant on a tuesday evening. the restaurant is situated very convenient at the center of the city. the interior is contemporary which fits the location it is i 
"dont really like to give negative reviews but in this case i had too :( went in with the idea of getting a good fast food pasta. went to a similar concept of a restaurant in groningen, and zappas did not come near the quality of the groningen one. the service was just not good. when we got to the table we did not get a menu. after a while i asked the neighbours one. there were no options in type of pasta, only penne. i ordered the napilotana, and when i got it it had huge chunks of badly cut onions... they were not included in the description. the pizza the bf ordered was pretty descend. overall it was not really a fun experience."
the service itâs terrible and the dishes cooked without any comprehension of italian cooking style. item a typical dutch appetizers such as cheese plate was served without any consideration of the cheeses and the quality of product used was extremely law. i think they just work thanks to their amazing location. 
"when we visited the place just opened, so it might be one of the reasons we did not like it. staff had no coordination between each other. we asked for drinks three different waiters and after half an hour we still did not have our beers. then, the waitress came to double check which drinks we ordered. not professional. pizza was very average. "
"if you are tired after shopping or spending the day in the city center and want to quickly have dinner, this is a good place to go to; pricing is questionable for the quality of food but isnt expensive."
"great style, good food (no average italian, but a bit out of the box menu), okay drinks menu but the service was poor. they forgot half of our order, we had to wait long to get served and when we wanted tonpy the guy didnt even look at us while talking, hard to understand... however, the price and quality were good so ill give it a second chance and hopefully the service be better then. "
"really nice location in the middle of nijmegen but the standard of food is dissapointing. i ordered the hamburger, the patty tasted like it was bad quality store bought, the bun was dry and old,the tomatoes were old and some items off the menu werent available."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"the location is great, the beer pretty good, the food average to poor, but the service is terrible. ive been here a few times and either ive left because i didnt get any attention from the waiting staff, or ive stayed and had a series of forgotten orders, or unattentive waiters in general. such a shame on this nice of a location. "
i didnt manage to get the attention of any of the three servers so i left. waited for about 10 minutes
"usually, i have no complaints about this place. i really enjoy the beer tastings they do. the outside terrace is the most gorgeous one in the city. service is usually fast. however, we reserved this placed for our wedding reception for 25 people and it did not go so well... we booked the place more than a month upfront, spoke to a very nice and fast waiter who was supposed to be working at our wedding. on the wedding day, he was not there though, we got some guy who looked like he was working there for the first day. some guests never got their orders and after 20 minutes of waiting had to go inside to order again and bring the drink from the bar themselves. additionally, we ordered a big cheesecake for everybody (again, more than a month in advance). we were reassured every one of our guests will have cake. when we asked for it at the reception the waiter said that they dont have enough cake left and he knows nothing about the order. we waited for more than 1 hour 30 min until the cake was finally brought ( i guess they were baking it or buying it elsewhere). the cake was not decorated nicely, just served plain white on a white plate. usually, it is decorated. and to top it all off-the bill was wrong. they overcharged us!!! usually, a nice place with friendly and quick personnel. however, when they know they have to cater for a wedding-everything seems to go wrong. just awful. we felt ashamed in front of our guests for such poor service at our reception."
"the building is fantastic. de commanderie van st. jan is a medieval building in the center of nijmegen. there are different restaurants to choose in this building.(de hemel, plaats 1) and some other food related businesses. we had lunch in de hemel (the heaven). i chose the goats cheese salad. it was okay. nice cheese, some bacon and lettuce, with some dressing. there were a lot of tomatoes and cucumber without any dressing. the cucumber was dried out. as as said, the scenery is great, so next time ill try the other restaurant."
"i had dinner here and took the 8 course meal. i started with the bread and tapenade which was good. second round was the soup which was delicious. the next 5 dishes were fish and meat. with the fish, i could taste that it was fish from the freezer and not fresh, the meat was not cooked well. the waiters were very nice. i know that the price is not high (eur 28) but using more fresh ingredients would really improve the taste and quality of this restaurant."
"i went here for a lunch. the terrace outside is really beautiful. some of the waiters smile. this is the only good part of this place. we only ordered 2 drinks, a small lunch and one second drink. we were with 2 people. inside it was fully packed, the terrace was not even filled for one quarter. there were many waitresses. still they managed to forget the 2nd drink twice (we had to order one drink 3 times), forgot our lunch and when the sandwiches arrived (after re-order) the crockets were cold and the meat of the hamburger was cold. their excuse: it is very busy in the kitchen at the moment. so, do not go there when the weather is nice and the terrace is fully pack "
"me and my friends had dinner here and order the menu of 28,50 ( 8  course meal) which exists of meat sliced of a sword a little soup and salad, it took us 4 hours to from start to end a very very long time, the food was cooked, the pork rose and the fries very very salty - will definitely not go back here!! bad experience, been heer 8 years back (another owner then and then ik was great) - but in 2013 and up dont bother !! the beer however is super try it!"
