"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
"especially in summer this restaurant is the place to be, visited by village people and tourists. you can enjoy sunshine until ± 20:00 hr "
"large portions but not very good food. 12 ribs but dry. small, overcooked mussels in watery sauce. salad mainly iceberg lettuce. do yourself a favour and walk a minute further to it posthuswhich which does much better quality for similar price."
"this is located on a nice square in makkum.   the food is average, a typical dutch menu so little imagination.  its ok if you need somewhere to eat."
"for dinners with a eur 18-20 tag i would expect well good food. however overcooked steak (medium was requested), schnitzel was soggy of oil (not crisp) and plate was floating of the oil the potatoes was cooked in. however there are carrots and a salad as a side dish, so plenty of food. "
"food in makkum is pretty much the same, wherever you go...some places do some things better than others. this place has huge portions (normal around here) but they arent terrific. it is a good place to hang out, have drinks & people watch. the best staffmember is angelique, shes super friendly, fun, and genuinely cares about her customers. sime of the others could use an attitude adjustment! but you can usually find a table outside to sit in the sun, & the beer/wine is good."
"we stopped here one evening for a quick bite to eat. we found a table outside and were quickly served with our drinks - i had the enigmatically named wieckse witte wheat beer. the waitress who took our order was friendly enough but seemed to have her mind on other things. my order of plaice arrived without the special request for extra chips and it took some time to get any cutlery. the food was luke warm at best. my companion decided only to go for the tomato soup and hot chocolate with a pile of cream on top. that was ok, she said. with a bill close to 30 euro i wasnt really that impressed. next time we eat in makkum well try one of the other restaurants..."
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
"went here for a lunch/snack. paid a total of €12,55 for 2 medium sized portions of fries and 2 snacks. after almost 30 minutes our fast food arrived. it looked like small portions of fries but the lady ensured me this was normal. also the berehap snack which is known for being a big snack fitted in a small frikandel-sized cart "
had to go here due to the only other real good fish snack bar being closed. this will be the last visit here as well. i didnt like the very fluffy kibbeling ( not crunchy) at all.
"the food is not fantastic but reasonable priced. the people running are quitte blunt and seemed to be stressed, overworked. on a sunny day there is a serious line at a window where you have to order and pay. and although there is stated you can pay by bankcard (pin) and cash, i would strongly advice cash. the mobile network is for some reason in that place very very bad, sometimes your mobile gives no connection and their bankcard system is depending on it...so you would not be the first that walks away empty handed after a 15 min wait. is not helping the atmospher "
it is very nice to sit outside and watch the shoppers pass by at the plaza. food is not remarkable and often close to dutch snacks but it is a good place to be.
"i live in the area and pop into this restuarant from time to time. ive always found the food good, the wasabi mayonaise burger is pretty good and i found the lamb rack really really go "
bad food and no vegetarian dishes and when they were willing to amend a plate they had run out of pasta/rice. my salad with marinated beef wasnt tender at all. not going there a second time for dinner.
"this typical amsterdam snack shop sits exactly on the border of amsterdam and amstelveen. it has the usual selecton of inexpensive dutch snacks and nibbles, as well as warm and cold sandwhiches, including burgers and chicken sandwiches. there is a lovely patio if the afternoon sun is shining, otherwise it has small indoor seating, or a walk-up/carry-out counter. there is free parking on one side, pay parking on the other. plenty of space for bicycles. very close to then entrance of the amsterdamse bos (amsterdam forest)."
"i love surinamese food. this is simply not it. wrong flavours, bad ingredients, and not fresh. its the only surinamese place in the area, that is all it has going for it."
it only takes one bad experience with a cashier to make you never darken the door again. seriously after years of going i will find another cafe in the area.
"unpolite service, tasteless ingredients and terrible pizza. greasy cheese and soggy base. not recommended."
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill 
"fantastic food and service generally friendly, but made several mistakes with the orders and as a result we had a very long wait for our meal without any recognition.  a shame as the food was excellent."
"food was ok, nothing outstanding, specially considering the pric "
june 5th we had a special celebration and our first choice restaurant was closed so we decided to go to de jonge dikkert as friends had recently recommended the fo 
"as i live close to this beautiful restaurant, ive been to this restaurant regularly. as i really liked the atmosphere and quality of the food, i booked this restaurant for a business meeting. what a disappointment it was. first of all, not all food was properly cooked, leaving me with a semi-raw langoustine. second of all, one of the waiters a) didnt at all know what he was serving and b) didnt have a clue about the accompanying wine and finally staff my dietary request was completely forgotten when serving the cheese platt "
i can only describe our experience as very disappointi 
"when we arrived we were greeted courteously, but then we were seated somewhere away in a corner, although we had reserved. so we asked to be moved as we like to soak up the atmosphere. the atmosphere was really good, relaxed and its easy to have a conversation. the tables are also nicely spread out so that you dont have the feeling that someone can listen into your conversati "
"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.
we went to this place for lunch and had okay-ish pancakes. location is perfect for a break while shopping in the mall.
had lunch here earlier this week with my best frie 
super slow service which is amazing for a shopping center restaurant.  more for snacks than a meal.  the rose beer was good.

the coffee is okay however the big plus are restroom facilities which are in short supply in this center.  a good place to catch up with friends
place is packed with people and youd have to get your kids to eat their pancakes while standing. pancakes themselves are nice but not thrilling ( quite fattening ).
"the pancakes are great, well cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! the bacon cheese is very good and so is the spicy..they offer gluten-free pancake (if you order in the morni "
a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."
since years the quality of food is abominabl 
for first time since 2 years ordered the pancakes. my husband ordered qp me 
because of the covid closure we decided to order the dinerbox from aan de po 
a two michelin-star rated restaurant has to be really impressive. this restaurant only impressed in price. the portion sizes were ridiculously small. the chef even came out and told us at the start the portions would be small! i guess we could have left then. the food quality was good but at these prices and quantities i would take the nearby jonge dikkert any day!
to be honest - we expected much more. the chefs menue looked fantastic and we started off with a beautiful raw kingfish dish. after that flavours became a bit flat with as major disappointment the eel with foie and appel which was just too much together - made u think of pancake with bacon and apple. staff was nice and chefs personal attention was well received.
"made reservations with american express centurian months earlier. we were seated at the darkest table next to the door with no view. waitress approached the table and asked if e wanted and an aperitief, a glass of wine or a cocktail. i asked for a specific vodka on the rocks and my husband a martini. waitress responds with we can make hers but we cant make a martini(why offer a cocktail) (what?). then, all of a sudden someone found our reservation and moved us to a better table (we didnt say a word about the first one). serving staff plopped down the amuse bouche, but couldnt be bothered to explain indetail. if youre putting it on the plate, tell me why it should be there, or if too confusing, leave it off. the young woman who was the sommelier was very informative and helpful on the other hand. food. dissapointing at best. eaten at le bernadin and latelier de joel rubuchon, where the late chef roubuchon came and talked to us about his food, amoung many starred restaurants and this was disappointing. poor discriptions and very little harmony in the ingrediants. take the smoked eel. long strip of eel drapped across a bowl (why so much). and a little glob of foie gras in the middle. foie is so delicate the eel totally over whelmed it. no respect for the ingrediants. my husband felt the poor service was because we werent local, but why should that matter in a 2 starred restaurant. staff needs better training in service, like what the meaning of the word is, and kitchen needs to tighten up, less ingrediants to confuse, just let the product sing on its own! would not recommend. "
"for this is a fine dining restaurant, i expected a warm welcome, attentive service, and excellent food. in the whole dining, i couldnt not find a waiter or waitress to give me a smile. the tone was robotic and efficient as if we were in a fast food chain store: “please eat and g "
had to wait for ages and didnt think the food was great.... and for those prices!!! staff i thought were also rude which made it all in all not a good choice for a family birthday meal.
"food is of course good and beautifully displayed in this 2-star michelin restaurant. nice terrace, too bad there were no white table cloths on the black tables. we also found the staff to be a bit underdressed (jeans and sneakers). staff did whatever they needed to do correctly but nothing more. too bad the high-and-mightiness that seems to be typical for many upscale restaurants in and around amsterdam, also found its way to aan de poel."
"the restaurant was pretty busy for wednesday evening, but seems more the business and show off people. food was ok, has a feeling as invention stopped some time ago and a menu formula was a novelty. some dishes were very well presented, one was really delicious (blackened entrecôte). so at the end i would recommend to have there st jacques and entrecôte. and menu especially the 6 dish is exaggerated - especially in price (think it goes to 90 euros). we did not like the interior and the artificial flowers (in the netherlands?!!) are too cheap for that type of restaurant. there are better places - even very close het bosch , which i have visited many times is beating it easily "
"good food with reasonable price. however, the service and tempo are not worth the two star at all. we wait for almost one hour for dessert and the four courses set took us 160 mins...it also took more than 10 mins to get check. its a truly awful experience and i wont visit again for sure."
we went to the restaurant 4 people. drank a lot of wine and paid the bill without studying it closely. later on we discovered that we were charged for 5 people instead of 4 for the 5-course dinner that we ha 
"we reserved an outside table at this restaurant on one of the hottest days of the summer. in the afternoon before our visit the staff called to confirm our reservation. we confirmed and because of the nice weather we specifically asked again for an outside table, which was said to be no proble "
"i can be real short on this one: rude and unfriendly service, acceptable food, nice location. please stay away."
"we had very high expectations but nothing was special about the restaurant, service was below average far from 2 michelin star standards, service people was having an otiose arrogance, food was nothing special, dressings of food was good but taste was not that special, ambiance is also nothing special"
"rude staff, i do not recommend this restaurant.  there are many other great options close by.  stopped by on a tuesday evening and have never had a worse experience."
"went with pretty high hopes and recommendations. went well on arrival, champagne and oysters on beautiful terrace, but then nothing. sat for 30 mins with empty glasses. chased down a waiter who sent someone to our table and we asked for a glass of wine that would go with the first course. nothing for another 20 mins and i had to chase down a waiter again. i actually asked if there was something wrong because there seemed to be a swarm of confused looking staff but no service. no apology, no understanding of our situation, in fact, their answer was about having 80 covers and it being difficult when everyone moves from outside terrace to inside. hmm, made to feel i shouldnt have complained. wont be going back here. made me feel i was in a chain restauran "
"if it were just for the taste of the food i would definitely recommend aan de poel. we had the 6 course alliance menu recommended by the chef and all dishes were very tasty, with simple ingedients and not too molecular. only down side with the menu was that the portions remained very small, and even for a tiny person like me, i was quite hungry after all amuses, starters and mains, so i had to order some extra cheese. i have never experienced this in a michelin star restaura "
we were checking out this place to celebrate our honeymoon party in december. so we were sitting on the bar and ordered a beer. then they told us we could not get a drink on the bar if we were not also eating. so we told our story that we were checking out the place and we also would like to see the menu. then they told us friendly to leave....
"the food was beautiful. all the flavours went together marvelously. we had the 6 course seasonal menue. however, after having spend a lovely evening, we were shocked when the valet told us that our car was broken into! in the restaurants parking lot and under their supervision. the thief stole my working laptop in the trunk. very unfortunate event, the security should have been tighter, especially since they told us it was the second time within a year that this had happened."
"after a great time here in 2010 we went back. this time the food and service were of much lower quality. the price / quality ratio is not ok. no really outstanding dishes as before. service is often slow and not really professional. at the end the bill had several errors. correcting the bill took very long, while we had indicated to be in a hurry. the waiter even let the new bill wait at his desk and went to bring drinks to other guests, before handing us the bill. all the time we were waiting at the exit. very rude. we had a bad experience."
access for tourists via public transport (ov or openbare vervoer) is difficult. but well worth the effort for the succulent and unlimited (onbeperkt) spareribs - a backpackers paradi 
"the first thing we got told: no, you cannot sit at your prefered table because then i have to walk too much. that set the scene for the evening: every cause was delivered with some error, drinks missing for the apéritif, bread missing with the starter, fries missing with the main meal, the fries finally arrived after asking twice and when we all had finished the me "
"the place is really very average, the amuse we got tasted very much like supermarket spreadable sausage that was a bit dressed up. the starter of ossenworst ( spiced raw beef) tartaar conceptionally was interesting but the final result turned out to be a bit of the traditional ossenworst with some dressing on t "
"to begin with the most positive: beautiful location, nice quiet atmosphere. but thats it unfortunately. the concept is unclear: starters and main course are tiny (even for a starter!). so after two courses a healthy stomach is certainly not satisfied. the quality was not convincing. my tuna looked like chewing gum, the pork belly was nearly all fat. apart from that, the prices are really high compared to what is being offered. perhaps kronenburg is the restaurant for tourists who are willing to pay the price but as a citizen of amstelveen i must conclude that there are better and less expensive restaurants to go to."
"perhaps it was the fact that we were a very large group that caused the food to be a disappointment. the first impressions of the kronenburg are very favourable- a stylish exterior and a spacious, quality interior. the place has that air of quality about it. unfortunately the food was largely uninspiring. a decent carpaccio of scallops was a good start but the duck (tough) and hare (very tough) did nothing for the palate. an anonymous ice cream based pudding also lacked any substance or taste. i am sure the quality of food is better than we experienced but it may better when the groups are not so large."
"i reviewed this restaurant on 12 november 2015 and at that time was pleasantly surprised. however our recent visit was a disappointment, especially for the service rendered. the food was not bad, but also nothing to brag about. for a refill of our wine, we had to ask three or four times. the appetizer came in a reasonable time, but for the main course, i had to get up and inquire what happened to our order. when it finally came it was just above room temperature. we were not in the mood anymore for a desert."
food was good but unremarkable. the young waiter was perhaps just a bit too eager to please- pushed us for chips and wine when we had indicated that we were happy with our order choice. venue was quite smart with welcoming staff at the front desk. overall fine for a quick business lunch so would go again.
"had a great evening here with good friends one of them having a glut allergy. after a poor amuse (courgette kerry cake), a nice tuna tartar, a tasty lobster / steak, followed by a good looking desert. however, glut free coffee sweets were not available in spite of an upfront reservation. service friendly, fine ambiance with lots of space. overall a nice experience but could be better ..."
"the location is good.. a man made lake and green trees, with an outside terrace and a cozy minimalist modern interior design... but the food was the turn down.. ive been to hundreds of different restaurants in netherlands but this one is my absolute dissapointment.. taste is bland and plain, no beauty in the food presentation, size is unimpressive.. overall so dissapointing.. loetje should take over this restaurant and use the awesome location and building.."
"the location is the only thing that enjoyable while i dont know why there are many waitresses there serving food that wasnt even deserve to be called food.. tasteless, amount is like starter for a main course and dessert that looked like it can be bought in supermarket and no efforts of art put in it whatsoever "
"the good and quick behavior of the room staff cannot mask the low capability of the kitchen: the grilled mix is not grilled at all, the french fries are not french at all, the vegetarian dishes are not attractive..."
"menu and decor and staff all the same. pleasant waiters, easy wine, no advise with combi food and wine. food is simple and ok. close to hotel and around the area not much other choice"
"nice is quite nice. nice and friendly waitress and the food was nice.  nothing super special just quick, ok food at a very reasonable price."
i had watered-down onion soup with a cheese bread topping that you couldnt bite i 
"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "
place looks quite nice but limited menu. not very busy but still they managed to forget to bring veg with mail course. ruined the meal. i used to go before the rebranding and reopening but never again. owners need to check and train staff. our table were not the only ones having issues that evening...

ive been year for a dinner with some collegues during a business trip in amstelv 
"this restaurant is next to the grand hotel in amstelveen (less than a minute walk) and is basically the only place to eat when you dont want to go somewhere else by car or taxi. service and food are good, but nothing really outstanding. its perfect for a quick dinner after a long day of work. staff speaks fluentl english, so easy also for foreign guests."
"this bistro may be nice, but not more than that. it seems to cater mainly to visitors of the nearby hotel (no restaurant of its own) and of the sports complex as there is nothing else around. i gu "
"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
ive visited this place several times and yesterday was the worst out of a 
"after the starters we have to see the whole restaurant getting food but us. after informing at a waiter he said it would be there in a minute, after 10 minutes we informed at another waiter who actually went to the kitchen. we saw about 40 people getting served (also people who entered the place much later) before we finally got the main course. they were just in time, we were about to lea "
"nice place to be, i think its mostly after work drinks and diner. diner is good, but not surprising. its pub like / eetcafé. waitresses are experienced and understand their job."
"after a walk we ended up here for a drink. ordered also vegetarian burger that was disappointed. it was not fresh prepared, they fried and not baked. the salad with it was tasteless and almost no dressing the french fries where to hard. in bother words very disappointing for 12 euro. the service was friendly "
you have never ever seen ribs this size and they are like something from the flint stones. good food and value for a family.  not gone fine dining. but worth a visit if youre very hungry!
this place has been the same ever since i first visited it in 2003. nothing really changed on the inside or the menu. still i am going back there several times a year just because it is what it is. famous for its sate and nothing more. it is really good thoug 
"this eatery is totally devoid of any sophistication. the entourage is chaotic rather than cosy, and the staff indifferent rather than inattenti "
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
"group of 6 visited this eatery, 2 of us didn’t get what we ordered and 3/6 plates were mostly served with cold fries, the chicken burger was scraggy bits of chicken thighs put together it was unpleasant. service was poor and they only agreed to take one meal off the bill. very disappointing."
"it was a lunch time (23.03.2022) and i entered the place and waiter was near me cleaning the table and i kindly asked for the menu. he answered you have just entered sit and wait and i said ok. it wasnt problem at all, the problem was that when he brought the menu he just literally threw it infront of me. when i left he asked, dont you order, i told no. he told very good, byeeee. will never visit that place again."
regularly visit this bar as its in a nice location in the stadhart. its a really nice place but the staff can be so slow. all nice people but keep your head up and look out for customers who need service. have sat down in this bar and waited up to 15 minutes trying to get the staffs attention. head up and look after your customers
"we sat on the terrace outside as we wished to catch some fresh air after shopping. unfortunately not much space in the sun, but i am sure there is in the summer. we had some wines which were of a nice quality and shoestring fries. they were spiced with some cajun herbs if i am not mistaken. very nice place to sit, relax and have some drinks and bites! "
"pretty good food but terrible service- slow, unfriendly, no english menu, not enough and veryyyy slow service."
"went there for lunch. the food is good, however very disappointed with the service. we were with a 1yr old and were placed in one of the booths. so far, so good. they were helpful in providing high chair etc. however when they brought over our hot beverages and in particular a cup of hot water (tea) our waiter nearly served it over the head of our little one. of course this scared us and we asked him to please not serve it over the little one and to be careful. his reply was that it will be fine and that accidents actually happen when people tried to help him. in other words, he ended up serving it over the little ones head and ignored to acknowledge that accidents can happen, except when caused by others. this reckless attitude truly threw us off. we only stayed because it was lunch time for our little one and didnt want the hassle to look for another place. but we will never go back again!!"
the ambiance is that of an american diner just more tasteful. it was very busy at lunch time being the autumn holidays. ordered a thai beef salad which was excellent. the burfger with a bun less exciting. the service very good - a very charming waitress. great staff. worth a visit if you go shopping there. we would go back.
a place for some drinks and a quite interesting menu offering from sandwiches to main continental dishes. service is very attentive and sitting outside is pretty enjoyable but the interiors are a little dark though....
great food and atmosphere in the middle of the shopping area. this is a nice place to grab a coffee or enjoy your drinks in between or after shopping.
"we went here for a pre-theater dinner, hoping that 1.5 hours would more than enough for a 2-course dinner. it wasnt. we only had a main course and had to wait an hour to get it. then we had to wolf it down, skip dessert and run to make the theater in time. we had to remind the waiter 3 times, but he said it is coming right up - while it wasn "

"came here for dinner with friends and was really disappointed in the quality of the food - i ordered chicken sate with fries, fries were undercooked and ironically the chicken overcooked making it taste like rubber..... the restaurant is nicely located in the center of amstelveen, so pop in for a drink but stay away from the food."
went for lunch with my son one day and didnt have the best experience ever. this used to be a nice hangout with okay food (pretty okay for the type of hangout) but it really has gone do 
"we stepped in for lunch. the place looks quite attractive and modern and has quite a lot of tables as well as an outside terrace. although the rather young staff does its best, for some reason you just keep waiting to be served. no problem if it were actually worth the wait... which it is not. the menu is limited and the food is really distasteful. even the glasses of mineral water were served in visibly dirty glasses. an experience well below average. the price is not, though. much better places are only a few feet away."
i recently visited grand cafe oude dorp and the fact it was completely empty on a thursday mid morning raised alarm bells. it did get gradually busier but that only amounted to about 4/5 tables being occupied. my friend and i were served by a surly waitress who seemed bothered by our presence despite being the only customers in the restaurant and when i found a hair in my salad (that needless to say did not belong to me) she merely told me she’d bring me another plate. no apology was made and we were left well alone until we decided to get up to pay for our brunch. the food itself quite tasty and fairly generous in portion sizes but my friend and i both vowed never to go back there.
"right from the start the server just did not want to serve us. never smiled from entrance to leaving the restaurant. we questioned our bill at the end as we didnt believe we got an extra fries but there was 3 portions in two bowls, figure that one out... we would come back for the food but will stay well clear because of the service. life is to short and there are too many choices of good restaurants in the area."
"went there for a dinner, sat outdoor- nice view of oud dorp - and had an enjoyable meal. the menu offer a variety of dishes from snacks, vegan to international cuisine. i had spare ribs that were good. a good selection of wines an beers also availab "
"a place where you should pick anything fancy from the menu. the slibtong, sole was below average. the simple dishes were ok"
"the café is located in the old part of amstelveen, close to the poel lake and city hall. its décor is somewhat dark, which comes across as 70s style, however the seating is spacious and comfortable. no problem to have a quiet/confidential conversatio "
never ever going there again . i asked for a small portion of food (from kids menu) because i had recently a surgery and i cannot eat a lot . of course the “boss” how waiter called him was really rude and couldn’t accept this . in this way you can’t keep the customers happy !! never ever come back here and i’m not recommend to no one . 
"poor quality for what you get, i was waiting 15minutes inside for someone to ask what i would like to drink or eat, they had like 6-7 people on the tables. my wife had a gastric sleeve surgery and she asked if she can get kids menu, the owner come and said you have to order from adults. waiters and owner very rude, avoid this place"
"club sandwich was not filled or spreaded at the edges, bread was soooo dry i hurt my mouth, 1 slice of bacon and one of the thinnest smoked chicken ham slice i ever saw."
"rude approach from unfriendly and unprofessional personnel. we arrived with about half an hour delay, apologizing because of that, and with 4 people instead of the planned 6 (and again, we gave our apologies). the tone of the waiter who welcomed us was aggressive and sarcastic, and he made us feeling quite uncomfortable, especially because it was a business lunch with our customer. the food was average, nothing special. i will definitely not recommend this place, there are better options in the area of schiphol oost."
"they were unable to provide individual bills although the reservation was made for more than 15 people. of course announced at checkout. no apologies and quite aggressive tone. obviously they dont care as the only choice in this area is the steigenberger hotels restaurant or them. its a pity as the food is quite good (even if we have been waiting one hour!). please change the way you are handling you guests, guys!"
"recently had lunch here with a business partner. in all fairness, the location is great and it has a lot of historic feeling to it, the restaurant is inside the former control tower of the old schiphol airport part, where it all started. however, the lunch was so so. the onion soups we ordered were a little watery and also the cheese did not have that nice thick and grilled layer that one expects of onion soups. both our sandwiches were average, we had a grilled brie sandwich and a grilled goat cheese sandwich. they were served with a lot of bread but not in balance with the amount of cheese. so, either provide more cheese or provide less bread. i would prefer the first, and would be prepared to even pay more for that. i also noticed that the brie was slightly overgrilled, so that could also improve. did not try other things, i think i will give it a second chance and try some other stuff, and see if they have improved. judging by the crowd, maybe it was just a bad experience from our side, as there were many guests in any case. service was nice and friendly, and that also made up for the average food experience."
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
the service is absolutely appalling. i’ve been sat here for an hour and only been asked what i want to drink.   if you want good / fast service then go else where. this isn’t the first time.
"we were here on a sunday and none of us spoke any dutch (which we made very clear to the extremely rude waiter). we ordered two plates of the pasta gambas. we found out after eating (because i managed to google translate that the dish shouldve included mussels which it didnt), that this day apparently was the restaurants leftovers of the week-day - they served us the leftovers from that week and the waiter didnt tell us earlier. when i complained, he said, the leftover-day was announced on the first page of the menu. we made it very clear to him none of us spoke dutch from the beginning, but he never cared to enclose this information. however, i did check the menus first two pages on google translator again and did not find any information on the leftover-day. when i kept complaining he told me to stop giving him this attitude (actually quoting him here). we ended up paying 15€ for each of those pasta gamba leftover dishes no one told us about. i am not enclosing the waiters name here in public but if the restaurant is interested, i most definitely can. do not come here, especially when youre a tourist."
"moscow mule. 5 iced cubes in a super small glass, 1/4 of a ginger beer in it. €9,5 gone.  really bad."
we had a small dinner and ordered two main courses: a steak and ceviche (special of the da

"i went with my family to this restaurant in the shopping mall from amstelveen for the first time. although i went to other restaurants there, i never went to this one before, but my daughter talked well about it, so we gave it a t "
"nice place to grab some sunshine, nice ambience, even seating inside, customer service is ok and food average. some options are good, others not so good (avoid the burger! unless you like junk food)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of children’s toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"the food at il caffe is simple but very tasty, with enough options for vegetarians. staff sometimes a bit slow (i had dinner here a few times and there was almost always a wrong order) but friendly nontheless. the restaurant has an easy going vibe and is not expensive at all, which makes it a favourite haunt for many students."
"it is a student café with all that it involves: the café classics (average burger, salad and saté) for a good price, a pool table and some comfy sofas to have a drink on. still, the atmosphere is quite relaxed and the staff very friend. recommended if youre around."
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbq’ed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
the frites were made as i watched however there was a separate charge for mayo or ketchup which is unusual.  the shrimp kroken was also locally made.  there was a bit of confusion that the pin wasnt available and cash was required.
"as its our last night here we wanted a special meal, we made a bad choice, as i have left in tears unable to eat my food and having been spoken too so rudely....the menu leads you to believe you get chips and salad with all main meals....as they brought out one portion between 4 of us i felt it was ok to go and ask where the others were to be informed that was it but we could order others and being told to let her finish when i politely pointed out that it doesnt say that on the menu.... i have left my husband there with the children as i was so disgusted....what a horrid way to end such a lovely holiday....added to this my husband just paid 109 euros for a meal that only 2 of the 4 ate......by the way other staff were lovely but the rudeness of one ruined it."
"after the kids playground we took the break for small lunch. it is nice place - view to the harbor. as outside it was hot, we decided to eat inside. it took some time to find from the something to everybody. menu did not impress. service was also not enthusiastic (but also not bad). next time rather for drinks then food."
service makes a restaurant experience and this experience was awful. awful!!! almost two hours of waiting for an incomplete order of burger and fries and waiters that just don’t car 
"its good location, nice view. we went there for lunch. smoked salmon with bread was delicious. they also served iced cold beer :)"
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"de klink 2.0, it is much better than we visited last time when it was still just de klink. service was a bit slow, we went for lunch on sunday and there were two staffs. anyway, food was great. we really like chicken saté and schnizel. "
we were there for snacks and drink. it was pretty busy as it was on sunday. tables on terraces were in a good location. the service was slow because there was only one staff who could take orders. the other staffs were not so helpful. we asked the differences of the menus but he could not answer and was not willing to find the answer for us. only he asked us to ask other staff. the location is good if you want to chill and if you are okay with slow service.
we had booked a table on line but on line bookings are not looked at. bookings were hand-written on a small piece of pap 
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."
"having visited this restaurant a dozen times since 1968 when visiting holland, our last experience for dinner was a big disappointment. people who came much later in the dining room were paying their bill while we were served our main cour "
"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. “no problem, sir. your round table is reserved”, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: “ we never book fixed tables sir, sorry”. but….. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"
"ice cream and food are not special, and service it is just terrible. went for an ice-cream with my little one and husband and we wanted to stay longer to have a coffee and something to eat, so i requested a table but the waiter saw us with an ice-cream and told us no, and he pointed out outside saying that the sits for people who buy ice-cream are outside not inside the restaurant. we just wanted a table to have lunch! should not matter if we also bought ice-cream earlier.... anyway, not the first time i experience bad service there and not the first time i hear from friends about the bad service. for sure i am not going back anymore, they just lost a client.."
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
"proper “twents” hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs it’s a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70’s feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still don’t understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "
"perfect place voor eating in town at affordable prices after you have done your shopping. in summer outside on its terrace . meal quality is good on average, but do not expect high cuisine. very friendly staff."
"the most slowly serving in my life. felt like i turned one more year. we ordered 8 small bitterballen and waited 45+ minutes. stuff served everyone in restaurant except us. i literally saw 15+ burgers (would be enough for a whole caw), desserts, drinks and also meat balls. i’m sure they just forgot about us and didn’t even say sorry. i just canceled our order and said i’m not gonna pay for the food i can’t eat. some girl next to us asked if we want her french fry  "
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
"from the outside, the villa ruimzicht looks really impressive. but the rooms cannot meet the expectations. the room weve had was covered with dust. so was the entire hallway. another point of criticism was the service in the restaurant. they were quite disorganized, and in my opinion, the food is slightly overpriced."
"we had meals on two occasions here, once on the terrace (burger/fries - c.19euros) and then in the restaurant. burger was nice but i think a little overpriced. our restaurant meal would have been very nice had my lobster (24euros) been served hot. it was only warm so i had to send it back. friendly staff. "
whilst the food we had was ok it was not the best value for money. what i found very annoying was we ordered drinks and asked for tap water as well (it was 36 degrees and we had been cycling all day). i cancelled my drinks order in order to be able to have water! other restaurants happy to give a jug of water in this situation.
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"some teenagers wanted to take-out fries on a sunny sunday, but were told that no takeaway allowed on busy days. they had to order while sitting on the terrace, but no ordinary fries available on the menu. they were forced to choose the fries with a small spare rib, priced at eur  "
the food are very nice but it took 1.5 hour for pur food to come. we have to ask for 3 times and the last one i have to say if the food still not come then we will leave immediatel 
"we chose this restaurant to host a catch up with a group of friends. it was a great location as the restaurant terrace is right on the edge of the beach and there is a playground just in front of it which was ideal for all of the kids. we booked a table from 11-5pm, with the plan that our friends would come and go at various times during the day and we would order food as required. when we first arrived, the staff were friendly enough and checked that we were happy with the table they had arranged. our initial orders were fine, but as the afternoon progressed, the service got slower and slower. this was despite the fact that it wasnt all that busy. we had one vegetarian with us, so we asked for a dish to have the meat removed from it, however when it arrived, the meat was included. on top of that we ordered a couple of things that never came yet they still ended up on the bill. we had one couple arrive at around 2pm and when we went to order extra food we were told that the kitchen was closed. when we pointed out that we had specifically booked the table with the understanding that we would order food throughout the afternoon, the staff advised that they could prepare a limited set of items from the menu. the food eventually came and the bill was amended, but we would have enjoyed our afternoon a lot more without the irritation of the poor service."
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di 
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
i doesnt happen a lot that kids dont like the ice-cream. in this case 4 kids disliked it. too bad. it was warm and sunny.
today our friends booked a table in this restaurant. we had a set menu with five dish 
we had two days a dinner; not outstanding. but very friendly and helpful staff. one could dine à la carte and also make use of a bbq-buffet.
took a break in this beach restaurant whilst walking on the beac 
"we attended a family diner for 15 people and we were seated in a corner, at 1 table. for this pre-ordered diner, they served several starters and main courses. dessert was served on plate. it was really a pity that the plates were so large from size, that there was hardly any space on the table. the service was friendly and checked upon us regularly."
"the food was ok but no more than that. we ordered calamaris and parmazan  fries and the calamares were small and overcooked, the fries were good."
dogs are allowed on the beach from october. after a long beach walk we treated ourselves on a delicious apres-walking drink in the beach restaurant kaap-duin. the interior is reminiscent of a xenos store. but who cares
"the food was nice, we had a shared salmon plate. though they forgot one part of the order but still put it on the bill.  personnel refused to speak english and explain couple of things on the menu.  long wait on not a busy day."
"forget the local wifi connection. they wont tell you the password unless its summer season... which wasnt, you guessed right! for entrance bitterballen - rather empty of content but crispy - acceptable. not acceptable was the fact that nobody provided us with cutlery nor napkins... we had to pick it up ourselves. the rest of the dishes was ok ish, both involved chicken thigh "
we stopped late afternoon for a cup of coffee. unfortunately a very loud woman disturbed us and the other customers.
the staff was very kind. wine was very nice. food didn’t seem to be homemade. tomato soup was very sweet.  we will give it another try though.
"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
"lunch was good, just 2 kroketten with cryspy bread which was good. the cola (it was pepsi, so thats bad enough already) had no sparkly taste, awfull to drink it that way! its a tourist place so people will stop by anyway."
this bar/restaurant has a great spot on the canal but everything else was average.  i wouldnt eat there again.
waiter cashed and cleaned neighboring tables without saying a word or even recognizing me - after 15 minutes i le 
"the location of this place is really nice, right on the water. we only had drinks and snacks and they were fine. but the service was made me give only 3 stars. one girl was okay but the other girl had no idea what she was doing. "
"when you are seated next to the kitchen and the owner/manager is constantly yelling at the staff, when you have to wait 45 minutes between starter and main course, the food better be outstanding. and when it is only good enough the experience is utterly disappointing"
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often there’s more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guest’s conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."

"i had lunch at tante koosje, 11 december 2021. yes quite a while ago, so why i am writing a review now ? because they are so proud of their micheline star, but not acting like it. i had lunch there the food was nice but not unique i have eaten at better one star restaurants. the service was not michelin worthy, it was far away from that. so i wrote a constructive email on 11.12.2021 about it, expecting a reply, which i did not get. then i wrote an email again on 11.01.2022, with a little reminder that a reply would be appreciated, guess what, i did not get a reply. so now after a couple of month i feel lets leave a review. as mentioned already the food is nice, but the price you pay is not only for the food, but also for the service and the service sucked in many ways and does not come near to a michelin star restaurant. there are better one star michelin restaurants where you could go in the netherlands. so my advise safe yourself a trip."

"a very charming location. we were sitting outside but it took too long before we were taken to the table. tasting menu, some fish, some pigeon, ice cream i remember. probably too much messing around with the food..too complicated...without great result. certainly not bad though. wine pairing nice but too much explaining from the brochure without really knowing. water pouring with constant dripping, serving a bit too much from the hip. approx 100 euro per person. "
"dining at tante koosje is always, no fail!, a treat. no exception this time. however, there is bound to be a however. my friends and i also in treated ourselves to the accompanying wine menu. this we should not have done. it was an interesting selection but served with aplomb and supposed knowledge that did not reflect in the taste of the wine. hence the average this ti "
"we were greeted, seated and then just sat there waiting for someone to come to the table to offer us a drink or any form of service. eventually we had to ask for a drink, which came. when my wife and i had both finished our drinks we sat there for a good while before we again had to ask to be served. we had been there for around 30 minutes before the menus came. the lady that served the wine felt it appropriate to just pour the wine and start telling us about it, interrupting our conversation and talking over us. it felt as though you were an imposition to some of the staff by being there and each of us at the table felt the same way. i have had better service at burger king than displayed by some of the staff, the food is not as good but then you dont have to pay 350 euros for it. for a michelin starred restaurant i expect much better, and for the price there are much better restaurants out there."
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91€ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."
"i held my wedding luncheon here with just a handful of guests in 2015. although it was just a small luncheon, my husband and i arrangd this as our only formal celebration. i had arranged some music to be played which the owner agreed to in advance. however, when the time of the event arrived, there was one other table seated at the time with two guests where the owner saw fit to give full his attention and cater to their opinions above ours. i had a wedding with music i couldnt hear and the owner remained preoccupied with sitting by these two other guests the entire time instead of being pleased that two people from other parts of the world chose his restaurant to celebrate their special day. when i asked to be able to hear the music, he chided that i must be considerate of other guests. i was not immediately angry and paid the bill in full but when i later attempted to connect on social media to possibly discuss my issue, i was ignored. a wedding is a once in a lifetime event and so caterers have a responsibility to uphold whereas his attitude is completely unacceptabl "
"a good host knows when you want his attention and when you want him to stay in the background. the host in this restaurant does not. dining here meant we had to pay attention to unnecessary explanations, including some ridiculous wine-for-dummies talk, while we were here for a family gathering, spending some precious time together. the food actually wasnt bad."
"had a very nice dinner with friend from hendrik-ido-ambacht. our reservations didnt work. we ended up having to wait 15 min. to be seated. the service was good once we did get seated. the food was middle of the road. i had beef steak. the poor old milk cow that gave her life ended up on my plate, good taste but very tuff and chewy. my wife have vegetarian plate that her just love. our friend had rabbit that look good too. "
food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.
"lovely place, great view. need some improvement on the fo "
"the service has been very slow! seems like this place is understaffed, especially in the kitchen. it took the waitressing staff ages taking our order and then bringing the food. my cousins bitterballen were more empty than full and it took an age for her dessert to arrive. it did appear like theyve forgotten to bring it, despite having ordered soon after ordering the tea and cof "
"for lunch its extremely busy, which is good. my omelette was excellent but my wifes tomato soup was from the ah can or alike, which is not what you expect. service is good and fast. prices are very reasonable"

"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"

"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "
"we recently had a wine tasting in that restaurant followed by a 4-course-dinner (group of in total 4 people). the dinner was served at the first floor of the building (so not in the restaurant). we do not know if they had to bring the food from downstairs where the kitchen is located, but it took a while before food was served. the service was not good and could be better. they did not pay enough attention to the guests, probably as there were too many people and only few waiters. very often they forgot to tell us what is served on our plates. the food was good, but not special. the price for that dinner was fixed and reasonable for what we got (as we booked for wine tasting and dinner together), so we did not see the separate menues and do not know what it costs to eat a-la-carte. not sure, if we would come back to this restaurant."
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."

"n52°5717.3 e7°818.6 part of the camping site “de bronzen eik”, the restaurant looks authentic inside. you can drink and eat in the café or in the more quiet side rooms. the german weißen beer is available from the beer tap. we enjoyed it very much in april 2012. the restaurant food was a completely different story. the waitresses, who serve you drinks, disappear in the kitchen behind the bar, to prepare your food because there is no chef working in the kitchen. to make the combination of serving drinks and cooking feasible, the part-time cooking is done with microwave and fryer. between serving customers behind the bar, frozen food from the freezer is put in the microwave or fryer. unaware of this practise, we ordered local stew pot and fried sole. the local stew pot was canned food from the wholesale. the fried sole lived to long in the freezer. nothing fresh, nothing tasteful. just examples of inferior pub food. very disappointing. only the drinks were worthwhile visiting this café/restaurant."
we have to wait for a few hours in heerenberg so we took this cozy place for a coffee and cake. good place to sit back and relax.
"in a quiet town, main street, this restaurant/bar is situated. you can have a good drink and a (menu based) meal downstairs. and up stairs they have a all you can eat tapas concept. the place is modern and nicely decoreted (fairly new on the inside). they have a nice glass fence-like area where you can look down into the café. they have a bar upstairs but the food comes from the kitchen downstairs. the food is good, portion size quite decent and it tastes well. it is above average compared to other concepts. staff serving was fairly young and unexperienced but they did their best."
dark restaurant. bad light.  we had lunch but it wasnt that much.. the staff looks like they wanted to get you leave asap.
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"so you have done a reservation with this restaurant, but arriving at the place results in a closed door. not even a reaction to the reservator. restaurant is not closed or whatsoever.   advise: dont go there."
"we arrived, tired and hungry, an hour before they closed for the day at 5pm and ordered from the menu we were given - we hadnt had lunch. the waitress returned a few minutes later to say the kitchen had already closed and couldnt produce the burgers wed ordered. (why didnt she know that before?) she suggested ordering again and shed see what they could do, but it soon became obvious that everything was off except chips and chicken nuggets, not even a sandwich could be provided. so we ate chicken nuggets (a first for both of us) and watched those around us having similar conversations with the waitress and being served chips to go with their beers. a shame, because the outdoor tables are a lovely place to sit in the afternoon sun with a view of the fort."
"nice location, easy to reach from the highway a27, enough free parking plac "
"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 €. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.

"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but i’m a little disappointed by the service."
the local soup (limburgse mosterd soup) was delicious. the french fries very good. the rest of the meal (meat and fish) good but not memorable.
"friendly staff, food was good perhaps slightly expensive for what they offered.  interior a bit dated."

you have to walk a bit to reach the brewery. the service and food were good. they have many different types of beers.
"we come from the northeastern us and this feels like a very northeasternly kind of place - from the atmosphere to the pricy pub menu and craft beer selection. the menu is more limited if going after 5 p.m. (as of this writing), with options for burgers, fish and chips, and similar entrees. the beet soup was delicious, as was the fish and chips. beer-lovers will find a number to choose from, with an option for flights. it’s a really beautiful walk from the train (look for the windmills by the bridge); go when the weather is nice."

"we just got ripped off 4 euros from this establishment. we ordered a mix of raw beef and cheese for 9.5 euros. then at the bill it is 13.5 euros, billing 2 individual dishes. we told her we ordered the mix and she said it is not on the menu anymore, except she gave me the menu i ordered while spelling and pointing at the mix, and she never said it was not available. avoid this place, they are not honest!"
"the restaurant is now called “trattoria italiana diga”. my review? terrible service and terrible food! we sat at the terrace as the weather was quite good (for april). the waitress came quite quickly to take our order (spaghetti with mussels and gambas, spaghetti with tomato sauce (kid portion) and a pizza tonno). the two orders of spaghetti arrive. first comment: i asked mine to be served with spicy sauce. never ate such a blend spaghetti even after adding more salt and pepper. impossible to eat it. my husband’s pizza was nowhere to be seen even after 10 min of our orders being served. we waited and waited, until i decided to call again the waitress (another one came). we asked for the pizza, spicy olive oil and parmesan. we had to wait another 10 min until the pizza arrived (letting us guess that the order had never been placed). the spicy olive oil? i had to ask for it again (btw: my pasta was served with just half a dozen gambas, the mussels were missing in combat!). the parmesan? never came. the pizza was as blend as my spaghetti and the lack of “spicy” in the spicy olive oil didn’t help in my already stretched patienc "
"went there for diinner because we saw the menu posted outside and it looked great. a waiter greeted us and told us to have a seat anywhere and he would find us. we seated ourselves and never saw the waiter again. after about ten minutes of waiting to be served and our dirty table cleaned, we finally had to flag down a waiter to order. we placed our order and the food was deliverd by another waiter. we ate our complete meal without anyone asking how our meal was or do we need anything else. i looked for a waiter to get our check and finally we got the attention of a person and they told us to go inside to pay. and by the way, we asked for a couple of glasses of tap water and was told that was not available, only by the bottle for sale. yes, they got us.. i eneded up buying one without asking the price...5 euros. we are here in town for 4 more nights and we wont return."
"very nice place, but after 1h i’m still sitting here and no one has served us anything. asked once to the blond waitress working on saturdays and i have to say i’m amazed by how rude she was. about the food i have no clue, i’ll let you now if they bring it."
really bad service. we’ve waited for 45min and nothing was served. i’ll never come back and seriously won’t recommend.
the service was slow. not enough staff on the floor. asked which cheeses were on the plate. waiter didntt know. had as main course pasta 4 formagi. no flavour on it and when i said that to the waiter. i got extra gratin cheese to give it a little bit of flavour. the interieur is out dated. they have a wonderfull place. hopefully they make something out of this. by
"this little eatery is a short walk on the other side of the bridge from zaanse schanse windmills. we decided to stop because of the bubble waffles on the menu posted by the doors. boy, were we disappointed. the bubble waffle was not freshly made. we saw the cook take the pre-made bubble waffle out of the refrigerator and reheat it in the oven. bubble waffle, two lattes, and still water totaled €22.90. not a good value for pre-made bubble waffle. cash only, does not accept american express. the only positives are clean bathrooms and free wifi."

"food is ok especially sea food always fresh but not very imaginative menu. in itself not a bad thing but the prices are a bit too high for the quality of the menu. service is very variable and not consistent, friendly but not very professional especially in summer time. definitely a case of not to much competition around. been there several times in 3 periods in 2016. summer and winter"
"we got our starter, my bread was ice cold and so hard i nearly broke my teeth on it! then we waited 45 mins till we got our main meal! did they forget us? then when it did come my partners mussels/clams were mostly all still closed and further down the pan even cold! my meat was luke warm and the sauce cold. but the chips were hot! the lovely girl serving did take some drink off our bill, she was nice and helpful, but saying that..... we would not ever go back to this restaurant."
"youre ready to spend a bit more than the dinner value: food is good ambients nice but if youre hungry you might be disappointed by the portions. that being said, the bill well meets a meal which makes you asking for a doggy bag."

"the place has style, the sea is a few meters away, you have outdoor tables but unfortunately the service it’s bad. i asked for a caesar salad with chicken. i started to eat and noticed that there were also slices of fish or sardines.i cant eat any seafood, i immediately stopped eating and my appetite was gone, the waitress approached her, i explained the situation very kindly and she really didnt care, she didnt take the plate away, she didnt apologize, she didnt ask me if i was allergic or treated to solve the problem, he only said ok maybe it’s problem with the kitchen and left, then i ordered two cocktails with the same waitress and when the runner arrived with the drinks he gave me a bottle of beer in which i indicated it was not correct. when i requested the bill the they never removed a bottle of beer and the salad from the bill, so check your bill well before paying for they only say the total amount that was supposedly consumed. i asked the waitress to remove the drink and plate of food from the bill. dont even tou "

"the weather was great, but still it was a rather unpleasant experience at aloha. perhaps it was a bad apple, but the service from one of the waiters was painful. grumpy, uncooperative and on the verge of what you could call rude. pay attention to the bill, as it could be different from what the menu says (not in your favor). burgers are meh, meat cooked well but the bun was pretty dry. will definitely not be coming back here!"

"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
didnt get offered the menu that others seemed to have (eggs bacon). waited half hour for luke warm soup . nice enough staff. but very dated menu
"after a ceremony at the nearby war cemetery our party of eleven descended on the schoonoord. fortunately i had made a reservation as our visit coincided with the annual remembrance celebrations for the battle of arnhem, & the schoonoord seems to be a popular haunt for participants & visitors in this respect. consequently the place was extremely busy & the staff stretched in dealing with the substantial number of guests. service was slow & a bit random, & it took a long time to get the bill. as for the food, it was affordable “pub” food, nothing to rewrite home about. the wok dish seemed to be appreciated by those of our party who had it, but the deconstructed ribs were so-so. verdict; overall, pretty unremarkable. "
stopped here for lunch during a battlefield tou 
"after waiting for 20 minutes, and no one of the waiters showing up, we left for another place to have lunch."
"firstly, the food when it actually arrived was quite good, but having waited 30 minutes for a drink, then a further 50 mins (80 in total) for a cheese banquette, im less than impressed. the waitresses were friendly and polite, but this is the third time ive eaten here and my experience is always the same "
we stopped in the grand cafe for a late lunch.  the food was average but the service was very slow.  would not stop here again.
went to the grand cafe as part of a group tour. the owners had been pre notified we were coming and how many we ar 
we ate here on a saturday morning. we had to wait for a very long time before our order was taken (we had to ask for the order to been taken several times) and for an even longer time before we were served. and unfortunatly the food was not worth the wait. the portions are hughe but the food was very grea 
"early evening snack meal. ease of parking. service average, however, food of good standard. met our expectations for a casual meal."
"the food was plentiful but ordinary. we are of dutch descent and i speak dutch quite well and had no problem making myself understood. the female server was aware we are canadian and she spoke good english so we had no problem understanding each other. she took care of the drinks. a young male server gave us a menu. we spoke in dutch. he left and went behind the counter and laughed and make fun of us. when he returned with our meal and later asked us if everything was to our liking he deliberately spoke dutch as fast as possible which was difficult to understand. we replied by saying pardon in english and he then spoke in english, slowly. im giving an average rating for service - the young woman was fine but the service rating for the young man is poor. that young man needs an attitude adjustment! if you cannot be respectful towards tourists who are doing their best with your language then you should not be working in the service industry."
was part of a tour group of 30 that had pre-booked lunch last sunday. we arrived 20 mins late due to road closures for arnhem commemoration to find no table available and worse no food - despite the fact that we had pre-ordered baguettes the day before! appalling service and no apology from staff member who couldnt care less and shrugged her shoulders! so much for dutch hospitality. avoid this place. 
+food was tasty ant first and well presente 
"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this “brasserie” is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."
"we attended this restaurant on two occasions .the first (for a lunch) , we had a good experience. sadly the second experience wasnt so good ! we called in for an evening meal and ordered our choice > the restaurant was quite busy and we noted the owner/manager was sat near the front door observing . in fact he had been sat in that position and seat we we had been there befor "
"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"the restaurant is located within a short walk from the airborne museum, and we had lunch here after our museum vis "
the best thing about this restaurant is that it is just next door to the airborne museum. it is in the midst of a parking lot and hence very well positioned. we went there in lunch time and placed an order but our order was forgotten by the service staff. since we were getting delayed we had to be satisfied with a cup of coffee. the restaurant was elegant and staff were courteous but we were out of luck! we had to rush to giethoorn and hence left.
"this restaurant is located in a building next to the villa with the same name, housing the airborne museum. flowers everywhere told the story of the new management, since january 1st. service was a bit chaotic and the seating somewhat cramped, but the lunch menu offered a selection of simple but tasty food. i selected the bread with smoked salmon and a draft swinckels beer. the beer was cold and the salmon plate was prepared with due care. the test of careful preparation lies in the state of the capers on the smoked salmon. here the chef had rinsed and dried the capers, removing the awful brine taste. a good score for the food. but when i add the service, seating and price level i arrive at a three point rating."
"we’ve visited the restaurant and enjoyed our 3 course dishes. when we compare the quality / price, the price is to high for the quality of the food. food was good."
i was very hungry after leaving the museum and convenience was high on my priority list. the selection here is pretty limited. i had croquettes and lobster soup. inexplicably the lobster soup had shrimp in it but the broth did taste of lobster. the 2 croquettes were huge. it was all fine but not outstanding and not really cheap. it served my purpose but i would look elsewhere if i had some time. 
been there for lunch with whole family. for kids not interesting menu and for adults the salads are different and worthy to try. the rest is normal dutch boring lunch food. nice place though and super good service. an average to good mark.
"been here twice, forgot the first time -- that is typical for the place "
"like the title says, cosy and nice but the food was a bit disappointing. did not reply to what the titles suggested. was ok but not challenging."
this place has a nice outdoor seating and it is nicely maintained. drinks and snacks arw quite good though a bit expensive. but is doea have a nice view and a history.
"nicely located, decent dinner menu, lunch somewhat limited. beautiful old villa with friendly girls waiting your table. when we had our lunch the restaurant wasnt full, yet it took a very long time before the food came ou "
"i made a reservation in the middle of the week, close to the big airborne event. the interior van be defined as tastefully selected variety of colors and forms,shapes but not my choice. it appears to me as cold and distant. and i experience that in the presence of staff as wel "
during our recent visit to airborne museum me and my wife decided to have diner at this place. unfortunately after 50 min of waiting for a steak (medium rear) and home made burger we were served with something that looked like a steak but tasted like grilled rubber. i suspect they grilled frozen chunk of meat and warmed it in a microwave. i refused to eat it. we shared my wife home made burger. i do not want to advertise mac donalds but for its taste and look and price they are much better not mention the price.to our surprise when it came to pay the bill they tried to charge for that rubber that is listed in they menu as beef fillet. keep away!
"our annual trip to oosterbeek with a market garden veteran was earlier this year than our usual september visit. we always visit the hartenstein@laurie a couple of times and always look forward to it. this year i needed gluten free and the staff seemed to struggle a little with it. after initially saying they could adapt anything on the menu, it became apparent that they couldnt and i ended up with a (small) plate of vegetables with some melted chee "
"visited this restaurant with a friend of mine. we got seated in a quite busy restaurant and ordered something to drink while waiting for menus written in english. the menus and drinks arrived swiftly, and once decided what to order we put down the menus on the table. during the next 20 minutes we watched our waiter seating and taking food/drink orders from at least three tables (all of which had arrived later than us). the waiter simply ignored us - we even watched him small talking with other guests while we were waiti "
"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at €19 each! we couldn’t finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to €46! i can’t help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. there’s many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
the restaurant looks cosy but sitting downstairs in the aterlier is different. good portion for lunch and it is delicious. service is a bit slow.
"bakery schuld originates from de town oldebroek, (producing the local cake klinkertjes) but has also a branch in elburg, comprising of a historic windmill in working order and associated buildings, where a bakery, a bakery shop and a cafe are situated. a target for a very interesting visit. ample free parking is offered around the complex. we visited to buy several packages of klinkertjes, but when we were paying at the cashiers counter, a member of the staff, probably not in the customer-comes-first mode, put a heavy box on some of our purchases. we had to get fresh packages from the shop to replace the flattened cakes. room for improvement in the customer service department."
we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef i’ve had in the years i’ve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit “quasi-rural” venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the €25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. i’ll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i don’t ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldn’t make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesn’t agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i don’t wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."
this restaurant has wonderful ambience; shabby chic decor with wonderful holiday decor. definitely unique in the netherlan 
"its a great location and looks really trendy, but there was such poor service. the waitress walked passed us 7 times ignoring us when we wanted to order food. had to get the attention of another waitress instea "
good food and a very nice looking bistr 
"had dinner here with my girlfriend. the bistro is small and friendly, but we did not really enjoy the food very much. it was ok, but not what we had expected. the service was good and friendly though. dont think i will be back here again. "
"service in this restaurant is extremely bad, after 20 mins no one came to take our order. surprisingly they have 4 waitresses with such service. finally one came after we waved for her. my husband ordered melted goat cheese, that must be a piece of bad cheese. it tasted moldy. i will never go there again !!"
"its been a year since my last visit, but i still dont know what to think of this restaurant. it offers a nice sit-down in the outdoor seating area at the main pedestrianised street of the fortified historic center of elburg, where you can watch the passing tourists and they offer nice coffee and cake for the expected elevated dutch prices, but the hospitality still needs a brush-up as i mentioned in my last review, to prevent the restaurant to descend into the category tourist trap. an example: we were with three and due to the position of chairs and tables against the restaurant front, and space only for two at a table, i occupied a separate table. these tables were very close to each other, mind. when i finished my coffee and cake, the waitress cleared my table immediately and inquired, if i desired another drink or the bill. this while my family at the next table hadnt finished there cake yet. talking about throughput in a restaurant. by the way, only half of the tables where occupied. no, i didnt feel welcome and a three point rating, mostly given because the nice spot in elburg, is the best i can do."
"not good, also not very bad. just nothing really stands out here and that’s too bad as the place seems to have all to make it good cosy and upscale place."
what a shame! good food wasted by terrible service. we had booked a table for 6.30 and arrived to be told that the table was not available yet and to go and sit at the bar (no complimentary drink) at 6.50 we were offered a table in their party room which was totally unatmospheric. at 7-15 we were offered an acceptable table. we received no apologies at all. the food was in fact really good but what a shame about the standard of service!!!
the go 
"the terrace is nice, but service absolutely not good: questions about menu were unanswered, made us feel unimportant , food was not as to be expected in relation to price ( dinner) , side dishes seemed very leftover and warmed up. spinach was potatoepuree with few leaves of spinach?, i would not recommend this restaurant ."
"we ordered salmon with fries, it came without fries, the fries arrived when my daughter had finished. my son ordered tenderloin stake, they forgot to bring it, the order arrived when everyone else had finished and it was a plate of little pieces of meat, on top of a lot of salad. i ordered a grilled goat cheese salad, what arrived is regular goat cheese on top of salad, without salad dressing and they said they had no vinegar. my father’s shrimp salad and carpaccio were the only correct dishes. they kept on sending new waiters, who did not know how to react. beautiful town, surely there must be better restaurants around here."
"mediocre food, sloppy service and the ambiance of a buffet-restaurant in a railway station. to be avoided."
"reading previous reviews is unfortunate.  we only came for drinks and snacks and were welcomed and received very nicely. good hospitality,nice beer and good service. cant say otherwise.  try for yourself and make your own judgement."
"went here without a reservation around 20:30 on a saturday evening. we asked for a table for dinner, but inside was fully packed. we were seated outside. the waiter came 1 min. later to tell us there was a table available. this table was a big one for 8/10 pax, but next to the toilets. a big downside were the aggressive flies around our food and drink "
"stopped here for coffee and cake as views were the best in town.  service was a bit lacking, otherwise a decent vist"
"awful experience: 15 minutes before receiving the menu, 1 hour before receiving the first ordered dish, 1 hour and half before receiving the second dish. all of the other customer have been served except us. we have asked for an explaination but the excuse was the kitchen is very busy, despite all the customer were serv "
"the restaurant is located just outside the city centre with a nice view from the terrace over the harbour. the restaurant is dark and the food is ok, but not special."
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
"perfect if you are into toddlers and like quirky austrian dresses on dutch waitresses. loud, unorganized and near average food. good beers. people changing diapers on the next table. parents running after their offspring. dont get me wrong, its crowded on a sunny day. has a playground. mass cant be wrong. just not for me. "
"dinner here with colleagues. solid food, excellent dessert, good, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. difficulty using credit card to pay."
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"nice location, but a nothing special type of ambiance and service. food is cheap and ok, but again nothing special. really a shame because this location on the dobbe plas could be a lot better and special"
we went there with some friends in ju 
"service initially slow. my meal: mosterdsoep | zalm | stokbrood excellent. kalfsentrecote* | italiaanse klassieker | seranoham | seizoensgroenten | salieboter very poor due to high fat and gristle content. dessert average. did not receive an after dinnner despite this being ordered! another member of our group received her main course incorrectly, she was compensated by receiving a plates of french fries. in all honestly this is he first time ive experienced problems at this restaurant. it will be a long time before revisiting."
"i celebrated my birthday here with my family on a lovely summers evening on the outside terras. we all enjoyed our meal and the service was good. we also had the retiral reception for one of our employes in a recently available reception area and this was as we are used to from eetcafe 1837, friendly and attentive staff and tasty well prepared finger food. this is an all round establishment and i would recomend it for family occasions"
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulée, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "
"very nice eatery with outdoor area, friendly and fast staff. portions rather small (both the appetizers and the main dishes) and for that rather expensive (11€ and 17€). the ribs were great, the loempias so-so."
limited menu.  pancakes were the specialty and these were done well.  other items were average.  menu is not in english.
the lunchroom of the huisje van de zeeuw is run by the krimpenerwaard day spending foundation. it provides extra structure to the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by offering daytime activities. this is in line with the perception and ambitions of each individual participant. we enjoyed a good lunch.

"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little café. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"pleasant night in this hotel. comfortable beds, rooms clean. we appreciate the family room with 2 separated rooms (1 for parents and 1 for children). bathroom clean as well but a little bit old. very good breakfast !!!"

we had dinner for four with my sister and partner while staying in the hotel. the food was good and reasonable value. the service was slow and a little dysfunctional. my sisters wineglass was stuck to the table to the extent that the waiter had to prise it off using a knife. the waiter managed to spill some juice from the serving platter on to my sister. the sparkling wine i tried to order had not been chilled. need to improve management.
shame about the two single bed that split avery time you even looked at each ot 
"the food here is a great disappointment. the starter was good enough but the mains were poor. i had dover sole, about 3mm thick and it came with a type of tartar sauce like that which you would get out of a take away packet sauce. my partners chicken satay was very average. not what you expect for €19.50 and €17.5 "

"went for a sunday afternoon drink in this place. we had a good hour out, i would recommend the chicken bites they taste very good. staff is very friendly and takes good time. the coffee is good. it is not too busy. due to the nice weather we sat outdoor."
"atmosphere ok, food average (minimal for the price). we tried it and will not go again as others are way better price wise."
"we came in around 5:30 p.m., because we were going to the theater after dinner. several people already were sitting at the bar. the extremely correct hostess took us to our table. on bringing our drinks, the hostess noticed our theatre booking and reported right away that the food serving would be no problem. extremely attentiv "
we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"
"staying in the (slightly isolated) hotel this was the choice for dinner, and a good option to "
"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant
"recently we visited the restaurant, and there was no table available in a light area. we asked for a table near the window, however most tables were occupied by flexworkers who installed their laptop or backpacks and were nowhere to be seen. the manager, when asked replied that it was no problem to them because they welcome everyon "
"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crème brulée with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"
"warm welcome, splendid interior, long time to wait for the food, two years ago the quality was perfect, it is a pitty, there was not enough personnel"
"on a rainy evening we dropped in in this restaurant. it was almost empty at seven pm. it was chilly in the room and the venue was the same. after adjusting the temperature of the airco to a pleasnat one we enjoyed good food, but a bit distant service. and personally i dont like television screens with football matches on the walls of a restaurant. the terrace outside is rather large but the weather was not inviting to sit down there."
we went to meatpoint because the website looked nice and it was near our home. cocktails are overpriced and service is quite slow and not welcoming.
visited meatpoint thinking it was still manhattan. apparently there was a change in ownership. terrible service. food was not great. gone down hill. avoid if possible.

30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"we had a family lunch at palkinto, really nice place, the food was simple but okay. chill environment."
"had a monday night dinner with a business friend. nice wines, decorum a bit stiff and outdated. we choose the 3 course menu. fish carpaccio with boiled salmon to start and wild hare / stewed beef. then dessert. food was good, but not excellent. i had expected more. "
a pleasant restaurant in an historic house in voorburg.  the park setting is allows you to walk along the tree-lined paths and along the canal.  there are also rooms in this historic mansion.
"i had a bad experience here, bad service and bad food considering the price that you have to pay for th "
"i went with my friend/colleague for a dinner on a friday evening. personnel was very friendly and kept our table even if we were late (but we did call to inform them). we chose the surprise menu, 3 courses. the serving speed was ok, but the portions way too small for that price. we paid a total of €100 euros for: a small bottle of water, 3 glasses of wine, 2 menus and 1 coffee. again, the food itself was good but once home i ate something..."
"first of all let me say that the 3-course meal was excellent, especially the starter with salmon... having said that, the restaurant apparently cannot handle several special deals occuring at the same time. we went here during restaurantweek, but had vouchers for another deal which was different from the one served as part of the restaurant week. we should have been given the choice of 3 dishes for all 3 courses of the meal, but instead we received the same 3-course menu that was part of the restaurant week deal. we mentioned this at the beginning, but were told it was the same. my husband looked up the conditions when we returned home, and not only were we right, they had also overcharged us for the restaurant week special they served us instead. we contacted the restaurant by e-mail about this, but havent received a reply so far. so, what to think... great food, but lousy service?"
"had dinner here with a larger group. the service was good but the menu and food was average, actually disappointing. the reason for the verdict was that the dishes were so bland."
"the restaurant looks good but thats about it. the ingredients were bland and boringly cooked. nothing impressive. pretentiously trying to be gourmet/fancy but the only thing they did was decrease the portions of a regular home-made meal. the service was very weak (they stored our coats in the kitchen because they didnt have space elsewhere, but didnt warn us about it, so it was with much surprise that we left the restaurant with our coats smelling of cooking!). would definitely not go there again."
"the food is great, but the service could be better in a more classy place like this. it is near the railway station of voorburg, so easy to reach."
i have been there a few times with friends and work colleague 
"there is a big area to sit outside, but in the summer it is very crowded and you might not get a place to sit. in the winters there is also enough place inside but it is packed and not really something you want to have dinner. however, for a quick lunch this is a good place since there are not much places like in voorbur "
my friends who have been to voorburg in the summer tell me this is a lovely place to sit out on the terrace in the sun. that might be tru 
located in the heart of historic voorburg this restaurant/bar is a good place to have dinner or just a drink (on the terrace). good service and food. also reasonably priced.
"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p. 
nice restaurant and clean.  good for lunch.  food and drinks reasonable price and service ok.  pasta with prawns and chicken sate are good.
"the interior is looking well taken care of, the service was a bit slow. that was strange because there were enough waitresses walking aroun "
this place needs new management. food and coffee (illy👌) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.
we visited here on our trip for a quick lunch near the city where our friends were marri 
we came back here after a 2 yea 
"we had a great meal, but the service was slow. waited for drinks for more then 15min also a refill was taking very long. then next to us was a very loud table and when asking the waiter about it he just smiled and pulled up his shoulder "
"i was very excited to go this restaurant, after it was recommended by a friend, and booked it for my husbands birthday dinner. the location and setting is great. the restaurant also has a nice vibe to it and was full on a saturday night. unfortunately, it was clearly understaffed and understocked when it comes to fo "
"a great location and nice food, but that is what you expect in this price range. the service is friendly, but lacks professionalism. the menu and wine lists are rather short. we had an enjoyable evening, but i felt trapped in a concept (including fake flowers and an artificial smell)."
"even though the food was still tasteful, the overall experience was very disappointi "
"private parking, nice view in the restaura "
food was okay but not the price you have to pay for it.  wish the former chef stayed...... the service was average.
the friendly hipster staff makes up for the minimalistic non-hipster motif and a few regulars who treat it like their own truck driver pit stop. the quality of their products including their pastry seems out of place considering there is not much competition or a discerning public but their efforts should be rewarded by a visit while passing through or instead of sitting indoors for coffee chats. a few neighborhood fans certainly dont want to see this coffee corner go even if it doesnt exactly fit the neighbourhood picture. i agree. the sleepy town needs some pepping up!
it was a busy friday evening and the two girls working front of house were very busy. the service was therefore very slow but very friendly.  the food was good but they needed more staff.
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasn’t a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anyway… waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"resto is located in the same building and complex as the senior citizens home.  it is rather. interior is spacious and decor is just right. food was fine and done well, although nothing that stands out. service was also fine."
"this is a very nice restaurant in many respects. the interior is very nice and excellent service. i think the chef also really knows how to cook as shown by the good taste of several of the dishes, with special compliments for the french fries. however, some serious problems need to be fixed. an almost complete lack of healthy vegetables is nowadays hardly acceptable anymore. furthermore, all dishes were far too high on calories, e.g. the pumpkin soup, and especially the dessert was completely over the top with too much cookies and other stuffing ingredients. so if they adapt to modern times and give much more attention to healthy ingredients, that by the way most often can also taste great, this restaurant has a great future. "
"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
great for kids but... service was lackin 
it was a nice day so the children could play outside and watch the animals while we chatted with our friends. we were there on sunday at lunchtime and the restaurant was otherwise empty! pancakes were fine but not very special.
"we visited here because we wanted to have lunch, but ordered coffee first. the waitress serving the coffee accidentally put her hand in one of the cups and spilled coffee on the saucer. she left and we thought she would come back with a new cup and to clean up but she didnt. another waitress brought the menus, and despite relatively high prices we wanted to order but then nobody showed up for fifteen minutes to take our order. so we decided to leave. not a good experience."
"this pancake house has a perfect location, enough space to park your car and bike. also, the restaurant has a large fenced-in playground/petting zoo which keeps your children happy. you can sit on the deck and enjoy the sun while the kids run around (but cant get away "
went there with the kids in the summer. the location is nice with parking space for cars and there is a small playground outside which the kids liked a l 
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesn’t seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. we’ll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chef’s cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
food and service were good; the privé of a glass house wine is way to much ..... vertalingen the raason ... not yo come back
"we went there for dinner, the service was very slow, you have to wait a lot just to get the meniu. i ordered something from “chef’s special” duo van kalf...it was so expensive, just so expensive as a tuna stake, but on the plate was almost nothing. the meat was not juicy at all, the beef was just cooked. nobody asked if we liked it, we could say it just in the end. and yes...we paid 21,5. € for it. very disappointed!"
"really disappointed due to overcrowding and stressed almost rude personnel. pity, since the food was good and the ambiance too. nonetheless leaving people to wait for at least an hour is way too much!!!"
we spent an afternoon here while in the area as we love craft beer and knew that de molen had won awards for their beers. the selection available on tap was very good although given how closely it is brewed to the cafe i felt the prices were a little high. it would have been nice if they had a sour (geuze) available too. 
it was a nice afternoon and we had been cycling so wanted to stop and have something to dri 
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be €2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
cosy place but the food was absolutely not worth the money. worst meal i had in years. the beer was good. touristtrap.
i didnt expect these tastes..i didnt like it at all..i dont know what happened..the last time i visited the restaurant was before two years and all the plates was amazing and could pass by my esophagus but unfortunately this time i have only to say the worse with lots of water..
"excellent food, could not fault it for freshness and tast "
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"the staff are really not caring or professional here most of the time. the food is not the best but its ok (average), if the staff had a better attitude and where professional this would not be such a bad place to eat but with bad service and average food. we have tried this place a few times and every time we think why did we do it. its a hit and miss. and we go expecting the hit only to miss most of the time. would not recommend."
"not satisfying at all, staff was not really caring (students having a job, but absent), food was ok but too much and not really 4star level, for a top3 restaurant really not where it should be, will prefer other restaurant next time"
we visited this restaurant last week with 5 people (incl. our 5 year old so 
you’d think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30… but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. won’t be coming back for breakfast that’s for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we enjoyed a great get together here, where the facility was perfect, the coffee was plentiful and the baked treats were beautiful. plenty of outdoor seating as well from full sun to pleasant shade. why 2 stars? i pre ordered a vegan lunch and it was just laughably bad. it consisted of two bare rice cakes, half of a sliced tomato and a few bits of sliced cucumber. it was probably 100 calories of tasteless bits of food. they made absolutely no effort to make something decent. its as if no one has a phone with google."
"the rib eye was tough and cold, vegetables were scarce and not tasty.when we said that the meat was tough, they did nothing. people must know how this restaurant has deteriorated because there was hardly anybody dining, only a few having snacks in the terrace. it is a shame that they do not serve good meat but maybe trying to get rid of whatever they had."
"young couples, friends, families, everybody feels at home here. the staff is friendly and laid back."
they are true believers in mayonaise. mayo on my salmon. mayo on the broccoli. mayo covering my plate. mayo mayo mayo. kids menu is a gloried snackbar offering. my pasta looked sad and was crying for help and respect.
"i use this hotel frequently to have small business meetings. it is near to my house, right next to the highway and parking is ea "
"the restaurant itself is nice, modern and clean. the waiting time was acceptable and waiting staff did good j "
i stayed here in the hotel so had dinner here on the terra 
"the breakfast is in the average. a good choice of sweet and salt, and the quality is also in the averag "
"i have been here quite a fee times recently for business meetings, and the uitsmijter i had for lunch was the worst i had ever had. apart from that the service is appalling, every single time i have to get up and find a waiter to pay the bill, and then they have to find the waiter that served us to take payment, so that takes about 10 minutes waiting around. not impressed!"
"great breakfast buffet lots of choice and fine quality of products. dinner very big portions not so high qualit, i would prefer smaller portions and improved ingridients"
"we ate at van der valk houten on our way to the theatre in utrecht. the ambiance is quite impressive. we arrived rather early and service was attentative at that point in time. when it became busier, it started to slip away. when we got the sole that we ordered and which was cut by the staff, it turned out it had not been cooked well enough. when the bill came, i had the impression that it was more expensive than what i am used to and would expect from a van der valk. all in all, not bad but not impressive either."
"we were in this restaurant business wise and before the meeting we wanted to have a dinner. the menu is still elaborate with trendy looking dishes and names. the service is rather poor with students with no hospitality experience. the dished served consist of the fish or meat with ample serving of french fries. the fish dish ( vissers palet) was a variety of fishes mainly too salty pangasius fillet, scallops etc. with some rather poor looking garniture. for business ok but not a place to have a special occasion"
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10€ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"what can i say. unpleasant staff you have to call by ringing a bell (inside) as there is no service. a double espresso? two shots of powdered coffee i wouldnt give pigs price euro 4,60!!!!!! its that i had to wait for someone but this is a tourist trap stuck in the 70s apart for the pricing. no wonder it is so empty. if i was the owner i would upgrade or enjoy my pension"
we vist the pyramide van austerlitz on a regular basis. we always begin with one of the walking routes in the woods and round the pyramid then we end up in the big playground with our small children. there are enough things to choose from so every child has something to keep them entertained also in the summer months they haveaarcade a sort fairground with attractions such as a train and bumper cars. the restaurant itself is very old and self service the restaurant could be improved and the toilets need to be cleaned on a more regular basis because they always stink and look really dirty.
poor and shabby place with much potential. the place is literally 100 years old. there is a pretty cool playground and arcade hall next to it. the campings are very nearby and also the pyramide. a landmark built by napoleo 
"the location is at the begin of the pyramide complex, not far from the parking place. next to the restaurant there is a big playground but its not open during the winter ti "
"bar and restaurant. i was here for lunch, and my 2 year old daughter and i were here alone for most of the time. maybe on other occasions its more lively. lunch was simple, service slow, and the setting was a bit dark for mid-day."
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (‚revenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"very disappointing diner. 4 meals were not ok. too basic and fish was definitely not fresh. when talking to the staf in a friendly way, the waiter became quite defensive and claimed every day they fresh ingredients."
"located between driebergen and doorn, the restaurant is favoured by my wife because of the beautiful out door seating in their well maintained garden. the food can vary widely from fabulous to not so nice, but in general the flavours, presentation and quality are better than avera "
"the restaurant looks nice, both garden and inside. the card promises much but judging by the little we ate, not really . we arrived at 19.30 a monday night, restaurant not even half full. three persons serving. two young girls and a gentleman that seemed to be the boss, only him took the bills. both the girls and the man disorganized, going around without paying attention to guests or having their own agenda, unknown . we sat at a table for two, just one napkin on the table. this was disregarded but we were asked at once what we wanted to drink. the waitress seemed to think that people should just drink wine by glass, seemed very astonished when my husband said that it is possible we order a bottle. she asked if we wanted merlot or pinot noir.... a little tired by the exchange we ordered two glasses of merlot, very average, and very little quantity. then we were left to linger over our wine about 20-30 min, our desperate tries to get some attention were cut short by the gentleman who plonked on our table two small rolls of serrano ham with goat cheese, and told us that we will get the menus but first eat this. a napkin for my husband was provided. the menus arrived by and by. i ordered a veal broth and a fish cooked in the oven sicilian style and my husband a ravioli and red fish(?) fried. after about 30 min our staters arrived. mediocre food, looked better than it tasted. and now our glasses were empty, we managed by and by to get some attention and another two glasses of red wine. and then another wait ....till 21.30 h when we were fed up and asked for the bill as we could not wait any longer. our empty dishes were still on the table...we paid a bill of 81€ for 4 small glasses of wine and two starters, one was noted on the menu 6,75€ , the other was about 10€. do not go to this restaurant, the lack of professionalism and the lack of shame in asking full price for an order that was delivered only half is unbelievable."
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.

"the restaurant/brasserie is a bit difficult to find, and you have to know it. it is the end of the road past de zandafgraving. so you do need some kind of own transport to get there (or walk). it is located on the top of the hill, near a small scale holiday pa "
"great coffee, average soup and sandwiches. slow service on a saturday afternoon, maybe due to a party. too expensive."
"the “de oranjerie” is located inside the park of the doorn huis, the ambience is charming and class; the service is friendly but not very quick; the dishes are well finished. very good solution for a brunch or a tea break."
"this restaurant is generally speaking excellent. i was very impressed in the past (before i was diagnosed with food allergies) by the creativity of the chef and great service, i would highly recommend it unless you have food allergies. i am gluten and lactose intolerant and thought they made good food for me, they served me cheap dry bread while my husband got an amazing freshly baked bread. my heart dropped, it did not seem like they were fair or well prepared. it was tolerated until dessert when again they served more options to my husband and i got a lame one with some dry almost burnt puffed rice to decorate the dish…..sorry, this does not fit the level of the restaurant. the cooks should be better prepared for fair options to people with intolerances, i reserved with details on my allergies and they did not deliver."
had dinner in this former brasserie. over the years the restaurant has really upgraded to fine dining restaurant. the service is professional and kind. the food is excellent and of high qualit 
you know instantaneously when you’re in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteur’s admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."

this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the ’smells’ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
"enjoyed a sit down dinner with fixed menu. it actually was good, but for the price paid, it was average. at this price point one would expect something much more refined and elaborate. the hfslg used to have one (from 1981 to 1986 even two) michelin stars, but this was lost in 2018. unfortunately for them, the very good meal that we had was indeed short of a michelin star worth meal. nevertheless, one can get an honest meal and the service is good, albeit slow."
"a beautiful restaurant, excellent service, but the quality of the food was disappointing. we regularly visiting michelin star restaurants in holland, germany, france, spain and japan, but the hoefslag is close to lose their star, as the food, the most important, was below the expectations. no dish was spectacular, a bit without fantasy, no 1 star michelin worth."
"have had dinner at the hoefslag several times the last year. it has been a top-class restaurant for very long. however, i was rather disappointed in the culinair experience. sure when you arrive you are received very courteously, the service is good, but never becomes personal, all more a routine then heartfe "
"after an absence of seven (!) years we - finally - revisited de hoefslag where we were married in a civil ceremony in 2008. so we were full of nostalgia and expectations, looking forward to a similarly sublime evening as way back when. our first impression was that not much had changed over the years; roughly the same decor and furnishings. this could have been reassuring albeit that it had all become rather shabby over time. one single bouquet of flowers unfortunately could not create an inviting ambiance on its own, especially when the view from the terrace includes a humongous, black pizza ov "
"we took our 13 year old granddaughter for dinner in the garden of bistro de ruif. nice setting for a warm evening, competent service, well prepared dishes. however, we were astonished- and more than a little put out- by the fact that we were charged 2 x €6 for 2 bottles of house (flat) water , i.e. tap water that is filtered in house (just like the water we drink at home). this is, in our view, unacceptable for restaurant where prices are already on the high side. the wine list is good, but expensive. when one spends €45 on a bottle of wine, one does not expect to have to spend another €12 on water! i dont think well go back."
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... don’t go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"went for a friday night dinner. small place with nice ambiance located in the center of veenendaal. we reserved a table (the place is not big) and ordered drinks and a three course menu. starter was tomato soup (very tasty) with smoked chicken and beer-battered fried mushrooms with walnuts and salad. starters were very good. thereafter we had chicken satay and white fish. compared to the starters these dishes were a bit of a miss. although presented very nice and good the taste was a bit bland. with a little more effort (marinating the satay meat and seasoning the fish) they could improve it. the potential is there! we ordered the creme brulee as dessert and the chefs surprise. very well portioned and tasty! all in all (for the price) we had an excellent dinner and enjoyed our stay. service was good and done by some young girls, we waited for the starter and they actually forgot us but the made the apologies and as we were not in a hurry it was all fine. so, for a good bite and reasonable price this is a good place."
"we had the 5 course surprise menu which included small dishes: one salad, one soup, one apetiser, one main and dessert. they were all okey but not all of them tasty enough in my opinion. the prices are good, the service is friendly but if you dont visit this restaurant, there is nothing you are missing."
"the food was cold and tasted like soap, server was simply rude, inside the burger the meat was still nearly frozen in the center. the fries tasted gross like someone had put a cleaning supply or soap on them absolutely awful, ate at mcdonalds many times, never again at this venue."
arrived here for lunch just to be told there is no babychair available and that the restaurant is not actually “ for kid 
this restaurant and bar looks more like an irish pub. drinks are good. staff nice. food is nothing special. the steak was basic and not tasty. hamburger looks great but test is ordinary. prices high. nice outside seating. a lot of other restaurants around.
"a lot of rats. the food was the worst i ever tasted, everything was dirty. and on top of that the service was awful. wouldn’t recommend."
words cant describe how trash the service is.  its a shame how they treat customers. if you want a horrible experience... go!
wouldn’t recommend !! they have zero respect for customers. they treat people like animals and if you say something about it they don’t appreciate it !! please don’t waste your money and time !!
"not even worth one star! if your black do not go! they will put your food on the ground, and tell you to pick it up! and if you say something about it ,they will call the police on you! im very dissapointed ,the way they treath black people is not right!"
"didn’t like my visit att all, food is trash. service not good att all. they are so mean to alot of people. so basiclly don’t waist your money. it’s not worth it."
"classical dutch pub. typical brown interior. we wanted a small lunch, and that is what they are good  "
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "
had dinner here with my wife and our 2-year-old daughter. stayed in the hotel (separate review 
"we ordered food, after paying they told the person that picked it up,  we had to warm it up ourselves. i called to complain and the lady at the phone was anoyingly unteachable.  unwilling to take blame.   what a disappointment…..  don’t go there."
this place looks great from the outside and has a pretty interi 
"restaurant looked so inviting on the website, but on arrival discovered a restaurant that was hazy and smelt awful from people smoking inside. decided to find another restaurant."
we were with a large family to celebrate someones birthda 
this an average (pancake) restaurant. pancakes are fine did not try the other dishes. it has a small terrace and pleasant service. not a place to go for fine dining.
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
we dropped by for a quick bite. it is at the centrum and close to oypo museum. the staff is very friendly.
"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"frankly a disappointing dinner,with our original reservation of table outside ,being rejected “ because it is friday night”. it is so hard to know how difficult covid makes matters,but in july 2020 this was at least open,clean and safe. hopefully standards will improve with experience."
"while asked the reception to turn on the heating in my room in the morning before my arrival, it was freezing in it when i arrived in the evening. since the heating system is more like a hair dryer on steroids as it jus blows out warm air of it, the room never became comfortably warm over night. and having the heating system blow air during the night wasnt a great thing either given the noise it created. bottom line: avoid the place if you are looking for a warm room during winter seas "
the chicken meal i had was delicious.  the beef soup was ok.  the sliced ham appetizer is a little squishy for my taste.  the shrimp appetizer was good.  nice views out of the window if you sit by them.
the hotel is located in the woods around the city. the beds are good and the rooms clean. only the price is a bit high and the restaurant is expensive.
"food was unpleasant and would not recommend.  english menu was very limited, you are not able to get the specials in english."
"we had planned to eat in rijssen itself, however after a heavy week and then a bracing walk in the surrounding woods we decided, after a quick look at the menu to eat in the hot "
"lunchroom t schild is a sandwich restaurant in the city center of rijssen. the positive side of t schild is, that there is a large outside sit-down area, where you can enjoy watching the saturday afternoon life in downtown rijssen go by. the service of the waitresses was a bit bumbling and unpolished; to be encountered in the netherlands unfortunately too often. the recommended home-made walnut cake was dry and nothing special and the hot ham and cheese sandwich my companion ordered, was obviously assembled in haste without sufficient care and served without appropriate cutlery.only the prices were in the expected (high dutch) bracket. i shall avoid lunchroom t schild in the future."
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
great location and nicely done restaurant. friendly staff. food is a bit ordinary though and therefore too expensive for what it is. a great spot for a coffee or drink without the hefty price tag for the food.
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i don’t know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"when we visit the netherlands, all our kids seem to want to do is grab something out of the febo wall. the febo wall is a wall where there are small windows where you can see snack . you pay the machine and open the window of choice and get the snack you paid for. this magical snack wall offers croquet, cheese souffle, frikandel. actually just fast food. it is fun to see how many people enter, choose, pay, grab a snack and are on their way. obviously, the food is what it is, junk food, but well.. once in a while we all indulge!"
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the table….. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . i’ve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
went here on a fridaynight after shopping for the holida 
"nice restaurant with good food. it want to be an upscale restaurant, but it isnt. the portions are small and the menu is not that great. choose for wonders or the other places nearby"
due to restaurant week rating we had dinner at restaurant. we dont understand the high ranking of the restaurant week because of the average quality of the main course.  nevertheless the service was outstanding and enthusiastic! conclusion: normal dinner with good price quality
"stroming is located at a nice spot in the shopping mall of heerhugowaard. it is a nice restaurant where many locals come to have diner. we had diner with friends and we picked this location because of a past experience. this time we were much less enthusiastic about the food. we sent a diet list way upfront to the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate that diet and of course they could. however, the implementation was awful and full of mistakes. between starter (which had some obvious mistakes) and main course i asked politely if they could pay a bit more attention to the diet of one of the guests. well they didnt. although the servants were friendly it cannot compensate the chefs ignorance. for the other people the food was kind of ok but not exceptional. the portions are rather small."
"relaxed atmosphere and nice interior. restricted oms are great and clean, but maybe that is because it is monday morning. however nice designed and clea "
"this is supposedly the most busy and popular restaurant in the area. when we arrived, the restaurant was quite full. there are limited food options and although its good, it isnt special either. (usual food yuo can get at virtually every dutch restaurant, such as sate, steak, pasta, pizza, some dutch style asian options like pad thai which for sure isnt like the real thing) service is slow. all in all its alright but nothing special."
i expected more from this restaurant. the atmosphere is good and the staff friendly. but. 
"i come in every now and then, but always suprised by the high prices. the wonders chain is nothing special, so the pricing is a bit off especially for heerhugowaa "
bit of mixed feelings after todays lunch at the heerhugowaard affiliate of the wonders restaurant chain. its located on a (not today) sunny corner of a giant new construction project that includes the biggest shopping mall in europ 
"the location is nice, with view to the water. we only had to wait very long for our drinks. plus point there is enough parking space."
"this restaurant is a restaurant that has good and tasteful food, but with a little bit of high prices. the service of the staff is oké, but not that special.this restaurant had a good location if you want to have a diner before going to see a movie, because its near the cinema. the choice of food is poor and i preferred some more options. i must say that what they served, tasted very nice. i chose a fish dish and it was prepared good. i enjoyed my time here and maybe i will go back again. "
this is one of these all you can eat restaurants that thrive on keeping you waiting for food - whilst serving you overpriced drinks..... euro 5.35 for a glass of wine 
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
"our last experience was not the best, me and my partner both had the burger from the menu. i asked mine to be topped with a fried egg and that was no problem. when the two burgers arrived at the table, mine was perfect and with the egg as requested, but my partner was not satisfied since her burger was very under cooked. we mentioned this and we were told that this was no problem to eat, since it was beef from the should "
visited this place with the family . food was oke not convincing but oke. the karma shoarma (vegan) 12 euro was in my point of view way overpriced 
we had an amazing party but the toilets were ridiculous. the ladies line was so long and they werent even using all the ladies toilets. girls were crying and the security was aggressive. i watched a girl pee in her pants and try to go through and the security stopped her. never mind the fact that there were atleast 5 open womens toilets when this happen 
"worst place ever. not too mention they’re expensive, that i can deal with. drinks in plastic glasses, fine. but having to queue 45(!) minutes to go to the ladies, that’s just outrageous. especially as you also have to pay for this ridiculously poor service! there’s certain standards that have to be met and propper access to toilets is one of the most important. if u cannot service your public then sell less tickets. this club tries to establish its self as upscale but in reality, it’s a dump. "
"nice for hippies our would-be amsterdam people, but nothing special. go north across the noordzee channel and you will find much nicer and authentic places..."
"quite a good meal, but having spent about 40 euros on 4 food items, a tea and a coffee, we asked for a cup of hot water, they refused. very stingy."
"we liked the menu and found the food of good quality. however, service was very slow even though it was not very busy. staff is friendly but does not seem to realize that they are there to serve customers. we had a nice table by the window and the interior is ok. but i can image if the restaurant is really busy you could probably listen in on the conversations at the table next to you. i would say that our overall experience is good."
"although we had made a reservation the booking wasn’t found. food mediocre, wine expensive, table too small, staff friendly. not worth a second try."
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"whilst the service was pleasant the food was not great. the goat’s cheese cannelloni was very heavy with thick pasta and the kale quiche was quite flavourless. my friend’s burger was also rather dry. this would have been forgivable until they allowed a couple to bring in their frankly enormous dog, which is bad practice for an eatery in my opinion. we were left unimpressed."
"nice, cozy interior - slow service - if their french onion soup is any indication of their cooking skill than 2 stars would be an overstatement. being busy at the time we were directed towards the bar (a tactic used in most countries) waited 20 minutes for a table although there were empty tables in evidence - waited another 10 minutes - and only upon request - were handed the menu. another 10 minutes went by for someone to take our order. when requesting a drink that we learned to enjoy on our german part of our tour we were told (although with a smile) that we were in holland now. all in all, one of our less enjoyable dinners while travelling holland."
"when you want just to eat a piece of meat (whether it is satay or beef tenderloin) with some french fries, go to cafe t hemeltje."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go. "
"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. it’s at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say “ignore visiting” and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and don’t bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so don’t mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
the food were yummy as always but had to repeatedly remind for all the items. unexpected rude behaviour by the staff these time around.
"we had a business lunch appointment and checked into this place without much further ado... had some great ham and eggs, with cheese on top -- not bad at all, some coffees and enjoyed the seaview on a windy and bit rainy day. that is all. there are 3 other beach bar/restaurants to choose from, we often prefer club zand to the others. but zeezicht is an average place. no surprises..."
"we often stop here to have a drink or so. volenteers serving, many playing and shouting kids, not much choice but ok for a soup or a drink. sit if the sun is out end enjoy. but not too long, beautiful nature around the corner (if not to many bikers and runners). relax!"
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosé disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didn’t have to fill in our details) they didn’t clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and it’s sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here 😉
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the saté meat was very d 
they advertise fresh farm fries. these are great and a real reason to come back as a regular. when its sunny thus busy they revert back to greasy factory fries which are not even cri 
location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
been there a few times and ordered something else every time. but sadly every dish was disappointing. it wasnt bad but it always had flaws. the location is cool. the personel is okay. sometimes they just close parts of the terrace wich is weird because it’s not nice to sit on every spot. they use way too much sauce imo.
we went there with a group od 16 people. the place was overheated and the service mediocre the food was less than mediocre.
my girlfriend and i went there for a small dinner just a sandwich or a starter we arrived at 17:00. we could only have small bites instead of something decent. crazy we had to wait for half an hour to order some decent food. we could also not have something of the lunch menu. besides it was expensive and service was poor. 
food qualitity very good but by far not enough.  service was okay but the food came really slow.  atmosphere was pretty good
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. don’t go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and it’s just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and it’s close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"we visited deining twice. last year, from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return her "
"lunch with some colleagues to discuss things in a nice location rather than a meeting room. we had a coffee outside and sandwiches inside. all good, service was friendly and efficient."
a really nice place as well as in good weather as in hard north sea conditions. beautyful fireplace and friendly service. the main dishes are not as nice as the rest and the pasta was more or less not eatable. just don’t try it
"from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return here. "
"we traveled from amsterdam to castricum to visit an old friend. we stopped here for lunch after walking on the beach. we sat inside as the sun was very strong. server was not very friendly but we got our drinks and food. we had salads and they were very good. when we had asked for still water and he was quite put off about it. otherwise a good meal, not busy during the week."
we went here on a great indian summer evening for din 
"went to the beach at castricum-at-sea, had a drink and a bite at deining. average food, friendly personnel. crowded and noisy, but hey, thats what you get at an beach inn."
"been there several times, always enjoying sitting outside. beware of the wind but nice place anyway and at least as good, maybe better than surroundings. but no really oustanding things to mention."
"for me it was the second time having dinner at this restaurant. what a difference with my first visit. it was known to the restaurant that we were there (7 guests) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. not one word was mentioned. the staff was clumsy with the wine and with serving after dinner tea. the owner/host never came to our table to ask if everything was okay. (this has been mentioned before in the lekker 500 magazine). the food was as it should be, but service and hospitality was disappointing."
"we have not been at apicius for a couple of years; a recent action draw our intention. however our renewed experience was not a favorable one: the hostess was quite clumsy (on our request if we could park a car nearby without being fined she answered: actually i dont know but you will find out sooner or later), the (excellent) white wine, was presented at room temperature instead of cooled, when we asked for some adjustments in the menu, this was received in a way that made us feel uncomfortable, without subsequent communication; the menu was fair, but not excellent or even creative; the beans tasted as if they came from the freezer instead of fre "
"the menu sounded very good but we found the food had no wow factor you expect from a restaurant with michelin stars. the atmosphere was poor, too many tables too close. i had a flower display taking up half my table placing that was imitation. not something i expect with fine dining. the whole restaurant needs updating, its cold with no atmosphe "
"only went once, but it was over-rated as far as we were concerned.  food was ok, service ok, but nothing special."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we came here for a quick lunch and we thought €12 for our meatball sandwich which wasn’t that tasty or special was quite expensive. the place is nice and the location is special.
"my wife and i ordered the catch of the day this was sea bass. this was two, uneven, filets of sea bass on spagetti with tomato sauce and raw bean sprouts. a fusion dish both bewildering and, frankly, disgusting. i think they should have warned us that this was a spaghetti dish. the fish was tasteless, so i gathered the tomato sauce was there to conceal this! we also ordered a side dish of roasted potatoes and salad. the salad was uninspiring and the potatoes were raw. the cost of the meal was around 70 euros and they offered a 10 euro discount. this did not take away the bad taste in our mouths!"
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the décor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
this is a very large buffet restaurant just off the centre of asten. it is on two levels as it has a mezzanine floor overlooking the main food counters. wouldnt recommend walking up and down stairs to get your food. stick to the ground floor. the selection is pretty much what you would expect of one of these places with a pretty good choice. the wine/beer/soft drinks are all included in the price of 26.50 e pp for a saturday night. there were a lot of children running around so obviously dutch parents dont have much control. there is a 2 hour time limit but if you cant have a meal in 2 hours something is wrong. no service as such its all self service.
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"if the chef’s wife is the hostess i would divorce her. he has a goldmine in his hand without het . food is gold, service with her is lead."
"cons: far from everything, somehow depressive. even far from everything, there is no mini bar or small refrigerator at room so you can buy something to the room. almost 0 facilities, no gym, no pool, really nothing, not even water at room. breakfast is poor and getting worst, they are reducing options even in bread. furniture and ambiance is dark. at the entrance smoker people has a comfortable sit so they pollute entering people with bad sme "
we ate here so we could see some world cup football. they had a big television insid 
"we come to this place once in a while and must say that food quality varies: we had multiple ocassions that food was not really warm, the fries bag not fully filled or invalid orders. but if you mention it, they will quickly resolved the probl "
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"het lieve leven serves rather good food, but the ambiance is very, very chilly. it starts already with the table reservation: the girl answering the phone is not really interested, just answers ok. decoration is rather basic: dark floor, no curtains, overlooking the highway. it all feels very chilly. fortunately i had a bussiness dinner, but as a couple i would never go there; a refrigareator has more atmosphe "
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
if you like dutch fried and deep fried snacks this is the place. but many times they got your order wrong and long waiting times. staff is not always that friendly but we keep coming back to this place.
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
"weve been to the flaming feather toverland, on october 23rd 20 "
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"stayed at the hotel for several days. the food was delicious and presented very elegantly with nice choices on both the a la carte and on the 3-5 course chef options. however, the service speed was painfully slow and wait staff seemed inexperienced and leaderless. restaurant was not busy with lots of empty tables but still was very slow taking orders and dinner took 3 hours+."
"dinner in a chateau. who doesnt want that experience. we had dinner at this hotel/restaurant. we choose the chef menu but decided to have three courses. after the amuse, which was nice, we had the sashimi of tuna. nice but a little overwhelming with different tastes. after the sashimi we had the trio of beef. a carpaccio, a filet americain and a tartare. very nice but the sizes were big. after the second course we had the livar (pork) and the cod. the cod was slicly overcooked and the livar dry. having higher expectations in advance voor the level if the restaurant, we were slightly disappointed. the service was very friendly and always willing to explain the course or the wi "
"we came as a business group (guests of the hotel château holtmühle) for a dinner after a long and exhausting day, rather hungry. the restaurant was somewhat busy, but it does not explain extremely slow service. it took us something around three hours to get food served. the food itself was nice, yet the whole joy was spoiled by the pace it was served. one doesnt expect two minutes of eating (degustation menu du chef - five small courses) and half an hour waiting for the next course. absolutely unacceptable. we regretted we did not dine at macdonalds that night."
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand café with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
we didnt stay a night at this romantic white castle but we did took a walk in the castle area. there is a walking route map in front of the castle by the parking area. its a beautiful castle to see.
"this could be such a lovely place to go to, but the staff just ruin everything. your drinks take ages to arrive simply rude in asking what your roomnumber is during breakfast. and the rooms are very basic. its good to sleep and the fact i have nt rated it poor is because its located in a beautiful surrounding (especially in the morning with the fog) "
"we stayed two nights in the hotel. the restaurant is convenient as there is nothing nearby unles you take your car. there is al limited choice and the menu is all right fot once but not for a second time as the choice is too limited. when busy the meat can be too far gone, juicy becomes more than medium."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
"this restaurant is located at the base of the wilhelminatoren, so location is perfect if youre visiting the area. its a big restaurant with a nice terrace. the menu is typical dutch and so was the food. we ordered a salad, a croque and a stew. all were ok but not special. same for the local beer. good for lunch, but wouldnt have dinner here."
"although, in netherlands under this corona crisis, you are allowed 4 people per table and tables only had 3 chairs, we were barked at but a very rude waiter, screaming at us that things are different than in belgium... making clear his disrespect for people outside of holland! i have no issue with directions being given in this crisis, but the way we were barked at, explicitly outlining being belgian is rude, disrespectful and deserves a strong review on this for "
"for the last day of may we decided to go to the 3 country area in the south of the netherlands. this is in vaals, limburg. the navigation system guided us through the city over the four borders street towards the first stop; wilhelmina tower. the tower was built in 2011. enterance costs 3 euro per person, small children are free. you buy a token to get there in the restaurant beneath the tower. here i had a scary experience as when i wanted to pay by pin i thought i had to enter the pin code but instead the device asked for the amount to add as gratitude. luckily it did not accept my pin code as gratitude; too much it said... but why? why asking for gratitude when buying enterance token "
it’s a beautifull restaurant at a top location. the coffee is tasty but can’t say the same about the food. especially the spare ribs were dreadfull. so if you’re just visiting to have a drink it’s ok but don’t have dinner there.
the estate is amazing! great view but the food could be better. i had shrimps on the rock (16€) and wasnt satisfied with what i got. shrimps were minuscule and one could tell theyve been in the freezer before. not worth at al 
1. the theme is good but a bit over the top. way too many pictures. 2. music is not matching the theme. 3. too many flies. 4. dishes taste ok but not looking good.
this restaurant is clean and food is reasonable and price is very good.  the inside is like eating in a church on church pughs.  nice atmosphere and unusual location.  overall good.
"the restaurant located in an old missionary serves a small menu with easy going meals and easy going service. very cheap and in accordance with the meal. not too fancy, but good to go. we had the local special zuur vlees which was alright. the restaurant closes at 8 pm!!! so be in time."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
"horrible waiter , she took her time serving us and even just giving us a menu , we ordered a starter and a main course and she brought it together?? why even add a starter if u bring it together its called a starter for a reason. when we called her over she even eyerolled at us 😬the pasta didnt have any cream and was filled with oil.. the burger was dry and bland and even the bread we ordered was bad i struggled to finish it just so i wouldnt feel like i wasted my money, worst experience ive had in vaals. i wouldnt recommend this restaura "
"a nice place to sit on the terrace, but the only table free was in the corner, so it was not practical to eat from when the main dish arrived, due to lack of space and being difficult to serve the hot dishes. hence we changed tables. took a menu, the steak was not very good, but the rest was decent. we wanted to try apfulstrudel for desert, as i saw this on the menu. but they said they had nothing but ice-cream. the desert was very simple unfortunately. i wouldnt recommend this restaurant."
"you can expect simple, but well prepared food. the prices are very agreeable. staff is very polite. the only point of attention are the flies outside on the patio."
"perfect place for a nice lunch, the staff take there time and are friendly. we enjoyed our soups of a chilly winters day. even though you sit on the heated veranda we chose to sit inside in the cafe."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the ‘reibekuchen’ were great. the ‘zuurvlees’ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
..i suggest to avoid this place and try somethingelse in the vicinity. the food is low quality and we didnt like the service also. i will not came back for sure!
"heading for the 3landepunt and we stopped for breakfast! all is prefabricated and pretty tasteless, even if quantity is large! nice decoration on the wall as it represents old news papers about the place and history about the borders! the waitress was helpful! however i would not eat here again! "
"the food is good, nice setting but slow service, good beer.  sorry but i would not go back..i was not impressed."
this is not the drielandenpunt ... its another km onwards. tower has no arrows or anything pointing out landmarks. drinks were expensive.
"the food is absolutely terrible. pasta was supposed to be fresh but was not fresh at all, pesto out of a jar, sour salad on the side, tuna sandwich with terrible tuna out of plastic box,… and pricy! way too expensive for food that is not at all fresh! 16,5 euro for ‘fresh’ pasta? 10 euro for a piece of bread with tuna spread?! we were with 7 persons and everybody left a plate with half eaten food. what a sad end of our family weekend…"
restaurant close to the 3 country point with a great view from the terrace. we ordered salads and fried eggs for lunch; average quality against a fair price and friendly service.
"we came to this restaurant for lunch on a rainy afternoon. there is plenty of covered, as well as uncovered terrace, but we chose to sit comfortably indoors. the service was very pleasant. the menu, though not large, offered enough lunch items. they have no salads, which is unusual. we all ordered a dutch pancake, and were unfortunately very disappointed. clearly neither the apple nor the cheese pancake was made on the spot. they were tough, even hard to cut. most probably they had been rewarmed in a microwave. what a disappointment, nine euros for a tough pancake. "
"for me it was clear that this restaurant depend on tourists and not people that return. it was a close call to giving only 2stars but the trout made the difference. being a fan of liver (especially with bacon and onions) the dish that was served was poor. liver was a bit chewy and a dish like this should not be served with strips of bacon. the waffle for desert was just ok, but they clearly used cheap cream and chocolate sauce. "
"this is a good stop when visiting the drielandenpunt. the view over aachen is very nice. its a relaxed place with friendly young staff and a playground for kids. good coffee. i was less enthusiastic about the food. pancakes were quite thick and tasted a bit stale, like they had been under a heating lamp for a while. "
"the uitsmijter is good, but the service is not that good. even with an almost empty place it took a while until we were able to pay. something that seems weird to me.  the view is great by the way!"
"nice location, nice panorama....structurally cozy environment but.....just for a coffee...or breakfast at maximum ....not advised for lunch....the menu is fully structured on pre cooked and artificial food .....have a beer....dont waste money in it"
"we were here with some friends to have lunch. i tried the schnitzel, which didnt please me. the meat tasted plane, there was some ham and cheese thrown on top and that was it. the fries were nice though, freshly cut in big pieces and crisply fried. there are better places for schnitzel around here, but my friends thought the salad there was good."
"nice location, nice decoration, with a wonderfull playing corner for kids. good service also. food is ok, but average price vs quality ratio. overall it worth a visit or two, specially with kids."
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
considering it is litterally attached to albert hein we didnt get the feeling of being near a supermarket. however if we had sat the near the large window / entrance it might have been differe 
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"we looked forward to our lunch here. very nice ambiance, great decoration of flowers, and cozy atmosphere. we all like a “long” lunch but we got here at 12:30 and left at 16:00. not because we were having such a good time, or great food, or lots to dink but due to poor service. it is the worst service experience i have ever had globally…the staff “disappeared” for periods on end. wine glass empty and me dying of thirst. from the seating to the whole meal it seemed like the staff had a big fight among each other and were not with it. according my guests the maitre’d was not present…which could make the differen "
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
"we stayed more then 2 h at table with two children for a 3-course dining. the food was ok, but more selfmade would be appreciated. my (varkenshaasje) had cooked to long, it should be rosé inside. overall it was tasty."
we liked the food but the wait between courses was longer than expected. portions and side dishes can improve. recommended if you are staying in the hotel or if you leave closeby
"dinner on both days that we stayed there. great recipes and cooking, but too many drawbacks to recomme "
"somehow not very organized. we made a reservation, but could not attract any waiter/ waitress to order a drink. the soup was overpriced (6 euro), and not special/fresh at all."
"nice atmosphere though tables are rather small. we had the venison menu. first course was carpaccio with i.a. qumquat, except that there was no qumquat. second course very tasty. dessert should have been tarte tatin, but proved to be a tasty bit of apfelstrudel. not bad, but should have been mentioned. wines selected with the courses were presented in an informal manner. in summary: not bad, could have been better."
"i come often to the hotel in avegoor (due to its location) and sometimes i dont want to drive out to eat so i go to their restaurant. each time i wonder what it will be like because the restaurant and hotel changes hands regularly and i have had, good, correct and disgusting meals. this time the experience was extremely disappointing. i was there with family and friends and their opinion wasn`t any more positive. across the room i heard a couple rave about the food saying to the waiter that they will be back and i thought to myself - am i so hard to please? or maybe do they know what fine dining is meant to taste like or what are they comparing this food to, macdonalds? the chips and sauces are not home made. otherwise the service was good and the location, especially on a beautiful day when you can sit outside, is great."
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"food is average or even below average. way too crowded, so nobody could keep an appropriate distance. overall very disappointing."
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. won’t be returning here soon."
mcdonalds nijkerk takes great efforts to enable the social distancing rules due to the corona crisis. despite busy times this went ok. the food was pretty bad though - for starters none of the big salads were available. the fries were way too salt. the big tasty burger was almost impossible to eat with sauces coming out on all sides.
"we came to celbrate y mothers 85th birthday on a saturday evening with a group of eleven familymembers. we were welcomed in a proper way, the restaurant is a cozy, though rather big room with many tables, also for larger groups and the service to order was rather adequat "
"nijkerk is a city close to amersfoort and has a number of restaurants situated in the centre.this restaurant is a 10 minutes walk from there, has a large terrace on the corn "
"compared to its fame in the area, the prices are moderate and the food is good to excelle "
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
its a bar / restaurant and has the foods you might expect. the quality is good and its a great place for a quick meal.
"combination of a pub and restaurant , but this is not a good combination at all: noisy , alcoholics on the bar. friendly personal , but terrible kitchen."
"i did like the place its pretty cozy and nice atmosphere the host is a little slow but the coffee is good not to cluttered. the menu had little like breakfast dishes to choose from but i still liked it, i still would recommend to try it. what they do have is a great variety of pies and pastries. "
i really like the atmosphere and location but would probably not go back to eat. the waiters came across happy and approachable. although the prices of are quite affordable. we ordered vegetarian burgers. the hamburger bun was a bit sticky and the (vegetarian) burger a bit moist and black at the sides. the burger came with potato chips instead of fries (which we expected of ‘hamburger with chips’). no veggie 
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"we went to the water sport shop in the area of marina horst. and as we still need two hours driving to our destination, we decided to get some warm drink from mccafe that just a three minutes walk from the shop. we also used the restroom. the cappucino was quite good. quick service and clean restaurant."
"after a long ride from the north, we came along for a cool drink. finally i took sundae strawberry. its quick, good service and the staff is very friendly"
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
"we went here to try out one of the many beers available which can be selected from an ipad. the beers were good and we decided to stay for dinner as well. everyones dinner seemed to be fine, good sized pub meals. my burger however was completely raw on the inside and the egg on it tasted burned. when i told the waiter he just responded with a short i can see that and walked off. no apologies nothing.. ill just buy the beers next door in the shop instead."
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"

"food was of decent quality, enough  quantity and not expensive.  personnel was pretty fast and kind. decoration was nice too."
"the food is good, however not very special. service is also good. it can be a littly noisy, due to the accoustic, so be aware where your gonna sit."
"split opinions on this one. i guess expect what you pay for, which is average. we ordered in takeout over the phone and were able to pickup our delivery in 45 minutes. the food was almost finished when we arrived, nice and hot sti "
"we had dinner in this restaurant on our first evening of our stay. my husband had a steak tartare as a starter and looking to the meat it seems not to be fresh. i had a pumpkin soup, but did not taste any pumpkin at all. furthermore the risotto as the main course was just terrible (very dry) and i did not finish my plate. my husband has a meat dish, meat was good, but the side dishes were just very poo "
"we had two dinners here with a group of twelve. the first was, in terms of service, a smooth operation presided over by a maitre d’ who knows what it is all about. the food: i had coquilles, two of them, well cooked but in a very uninteresting arrangement. the ribeye that followed was too raw in the middle, which made me realize i had not been asked what my preferences were. my omission also. it came with a salad with a dressing in the bottom of the bowl which made me wonder at first whether they had forgotten to add it. very good french fries. dessert: creme brulee but not with the essential breakable brulee. the next night service was below par. large party next door was the explanation. but also a waiter who took liberties and addressed members of my party in an inappropriate way. tensions between waiters and guests showing. food ok-ish, but taking a really long while to appear. not the happy gathering it could have been and where we were there for. not recommended for those who need a spot for a romantic dinner or a family get together. it shows that you are part of an operation focussed on large conferences."
the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost €12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than €1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for €12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
waiting time too long. starter was just a sort of beetroot ‘coulis’. not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. main course of fish ..the fish was too soft and cold and probably defrosted. chips excellent. expensive meal . pleasant service but food quality unimpressive. 
"we ordered a simple meal, sate menu with salad and fries. the chicken was just done, but still very white. the sate sauce was very thin and runny. the fries and salad were ok. the restaurant also feels old and run down. would not eat here again. "
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
for the prices they charge you would expect a lot mor 
"had dinner with friends at the pizza part of the restaurant. ingredients were not fresh, mostly out of a can. crust was good though. a lot of mistakes were made by the owner, who seemed overwhelmed on a not so busy night."
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual “fries” restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
only pavilion on a beautiful beach.  adventurous menu and great service.  we thoroughly enjoyed a long lunch.  unfortunately most of us ended up with stomach trouble later in the day.  so pls check your kitchen.
visited this restaurant today and decided to try something different: pad thai. quite a disappointment and does not even resemble the original thai recipe. ambiance and services are good though
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
"nice atmosphere, cozy and a bit fancy; nice waiter, but food was a bit expensive,  quite disappointing and not what we ordered (of course was more expensive)"
"if you need a bite in a hurry go there. not bad, not special, average pricing. friendly staff. close to a street with lots of people on bikes.  a rental shop for bikes is next door."
"there is a large terrace and a smaller inside part. decor is a lovely blue and there are lots of coffee specialities. service was good, pleasant place to take a break."
"well, we were recommended this restaurant by our hotel, so we took the 30 minute bike ride to the beach to try it o "
"this place is situated on the beach, so the scenery is ok. also the the decoration is fine. and there it stops. the food is not good, served not warm enough, the steak commes with cranberry and unions, but that combination needs more then just baking. the fish was very fat, probably baked in to much butter and served with north sea shrimps, which were not cleaned, maybe appropriate for gamba style shrimps but not for 15 little dutch buggers! considering the quality of the food and its overpriced. would not return here"
"we visited this restaurant on july 26th with two families - four adults and six children. after not being seated for approximately 15 minutes, we asked a waiter for assistance. he rudely responded that he was busy and would get to us later. after being seated, we ordered water and drinks. the same rude waiter gave us a hard time for ordering water because “they dont make money on water”. after asking for a drink from four different waiters and being ignored in all cases, i complained. the same rude waiter proceeded to get into a verbal altercation with me in front of my famil "
"looks like a very nice place. unfortunately we will never know. i was traveling with family. our group was 4 couples, my wife and myself and 3 retired couples over age 65. upon arrival there were 2 tables of customers seated out of 10 outdoor tables. one seated party was 4 persons and the other a party of 6. i asked for a table for 8 and was directed to a table for 8 by the owner. immediately after we sat down the owner came back and asked us to lea "
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.
"now, from a restaurant located in a marina you’d expect that they are used to handling large groups from, say, some incoming leaders yachts. but when we moored, and visited the terrace with a group of 50 persons, the staff freaked ou "

"disappointing, very small portions (seabass was two pieces of 3 by 3 cm only), expensive and quite fat (3 spoons of mayonaise on the frisian carpaccio). we expected more from what is stated to be a michelin bistro."
"this is landgoed lauswolts house bistro which is situated round the back of the hotel and reached by a trek alongside the kitchen and its associated service area. not knowing quite what to expect, we turned a corner to find that the place was absolutely rammed with just our reserved table remaining. we were handed a large menu, in dutch (fair enough,) and left to get on with i "
"we had a superb diner at this place two years ago, which was the reason to stop here for a second time. we found out that the place has new owners and also the kitchen changed .... unfortunately. it is an easy small menu, nothing special and the food was just ok. it took for ever until we where served and for us not a place we would come back.

"the terrace outside this hotel is very nice on a sunny warm day, so we ordered a simple lunch of cheese toasties. unfortunately it took a long time to come and when it did the meal was cold with the melted cheese congealed and unpleasant."

"nice outdoor dining by the motor yachts. food was good, not great. service was good despite our language barrier."
"we are a group of friends on a boat and wanted to have a good dinner out . the food was good but the service absolutely lousy . not friendly at all , no smiles .. just a very grumpy attitude ."
"we ate here after a long day of travel.  dined on the special, which was a doner type meal not as good as doner joints."
"the location is not special, the decoration is ok, there is enough and free parking in the surroundings. the service was terrible, the waiter asked (2/3 of the table customers) if we fancied something to drink without even handing the wine menu, to the other 1/3 nothing ever was asked for anything at all, 30 min after sitting there and waiting no waiter nor the management came to the table even though our faces clearly showed our discomfort. the menu seemed interesting, i guess we will never know....."
"when we arrived we were greeted nicely and were sat right away. once we place our order thats when it went down hill. it took over an hour and 15 min to get our food. the food was ok, i had better from a fast food place. i live in germany so i am used to dinner taking awhile but this was horrible. will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone."
i’m at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
"this mansion was advertised as a pleasant and welcoming lunchtime stop during a countryside hike. unfortunately we were rather dismissively told that we could not be served anything, not even a coffee, due to lack of staff (dispite visible evidence to the contrary). hikers are obviously not regarded as welcome guests. avoid."
after almost 8 months the menu is still the same. bit boring now even though the interial is fantastic and so id the terras.
"its a beautiful setting and ive been here many times, both on leisure as well as on business. lately ive found them to be inflexible. with a business associate for lunch asking if its possible to have scrambled eggs instead of the normal eggs that are on the menu.......not possible. even after explaining the simplicity of things here and how this makes no difference when cooking....the answer remained n "
"several rooms to sit one area like kids area and unfortunately our table is there, but after 20 minutes we could move. menu is lots of variety and they use lots of local products good wine by glass and young staff"
great place to sit outside and have a nice drink. for eating ? i would not order again. dissapointing and expensive
"we ordered the zeewolf, smokey ribs and lamshoulder. the zeewolf was way too salty and had to be returned and a new one was served only ok. the smokey ribs to dry and little flavor, finally the lamb shoulder was shredded and the taste was barely ok. sorry but they must have a new chef. during the past few years every time i visited my mother i took her there, this was the last time. there are better choices in town, one of them jasmyn which has great food"
"the food was good however, a bit to pricey for european standard "
"had dinner here several times, sometimes its great, other times its too fat or not so tasteful. the same goes for the service, its rather expensive. i really like the large kids corner, very handy with small children"
"this grand café adjoining restaurant seems to be the hot spot in the small but upscale(-ish) village of abcoude. accordingly, it was jam-packed on a sunday afterno "
"this was my first time in a long time i have eaten here. this time we were with a group of twenty guests which was a bit to big for the little space. this evening there was live music at the bar. the music was so loud we could barely hear each other. the nice waitress messed up my main dish order by serving a black angus steak instead of a chicken sateh. i did not make a big deal of this mistake because i did not wanted to wait longer for my main dish. i did not regret my decision because the blackberry angus steak was one of the best steak i have eaten. because of the messed up order and the loud live music i rate this restaurant as average. maybe next time with less people, no messed up order and no loud live music i will give a better rating."
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "

"
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast €12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars.

visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!

"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
good traditional dutch food and atmosphere. is is a pub dutch style plus restaurant. drinks are excellent: good choice. food is good and big portions. you have to make a reservation in the weekends. thursday night specials are advised!
"we had a family dinner here. make sure to check if it is a busy bar evening - to avoid too many drunk people. the food was great, but i was uncomfortable with the crowd at the bar."
"i frequently visited the restaurant, which always has been a nice experience. since corona has been there all restaurants were closed and it has been a hard time. now corona is slowly disappearing we are ready to continue life. restaurants have very different policies, but naast de buren sadly has showed most corona-proof, which made the visit rather unpleasant. since the restaurant host more elderly people itmight be good, but it i would not recommend it to younger generation people, especially not families. there is a strict table setting of maximum 3 people, while neighbouring tables are still close. the service is still as normal, without use of a side table or so. you are not allowed to walk of your table. it all felt pretty uncomfortable. we also had to wait pretty long for the desert and so. i hope things soon turn normal for them, because it is the first restaurant i had a bad experience during corona times."
"we stayed for a night in one of the larger rooms @ € 130. yes, the room is larger (5x5m), but the bathroom is tiny (1,5x1,5m) with a defunctioning light above the washbasin. tapestry in the room may have a shampooi "
"since it was a week of a school holiday, lots of hotels were fully booked. therefor, i had to find a hotel in the region and found this hotel on the internet. i have booked two nights, but i left after one. for business, this is not the right hotel: very poor or no internet connection, since you are in the middel of nowhere. also, no mobile connection! the employees of the hotel were nevertheless very helpful by installing a television in my room since there wasnt one (since i could not work, i liked to watch a champions league soccer match) . diner and breakfast were good. all and all, i think this a nice hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet with your partner, but not for business!"
nice but far from spectacular. have eaten in a lot of michelin star restaurants all over the world or “mentioned” restaurants from the guide so maybe my expectations got in the way. i wasn’t surprised by anything served. service was great wine paring as should be but overall the experience was below even one star. (personal opinion) desert as per picture an overkill. it didn’t leave you with the pleasant feeling as it should have been. i will not be back.
"very good, professional and friendly service. the dishes are beautifully presented and show a lot of technical skills. so many different dishes with every course, many excellent on their own but no balance in overall dish. most times in great kitchens less is more. wine list which is overall poor and many selections overpriced. for me not a two star."
"we entered with high expectations, but were quickly disappointed. the interior is kinda blunt and closed, acoustics allowing you to hear every word of what is said at the next table. the service was a little cool, and even though prices are very reasonable, wed like to know what we will have to pay in advance - neither the drinks, the lunch menu or the coffee were priced beforehand. food was good, but quite salty and not all food combinations worked out well - my taste buds wrangled a long time with the different flavours they were exposed to. done quite a few michelin star rated restaurants lately, but there seems to be some discrepancy here."
"the food at this place is pretty good indeed. something to be expected obviously, when going to a star restaurant. especially the fish specialities (fruit de mare) and the vegetarian hotdog were super! it is a real fishy place and it does incorporate the local specialties really good. nevertheless, compared to other restaurant in this class, i was a little bit disappointed. i had to ask for my wine, the vegetarian options were often a bit somber in comparison to the real dish and it was not really clear when the menu finished, since we were not asked for coffee or tea. not sure what happened and i do expect something different from a high-range restaurant. nevertheless, we did totally enjoy the evening from 7 to 12! in that sense it was totally worth the money."
"this really was a waste of money! we like good food, go out to restaurants at least once a week and dont mind to pay more when it is worth it. our first experience was on the apartment, see the review under hotel. this was equally if not more disappointing. then the meal: to poor a very spicy sauce over good oysters doesnt make them better but that can be my taste. then the most annoying thing was the amount of alcohol they pored as part of the wine arrangement. i presumed that the amount would be so that you can empty all the glasses in line with the diner. especially at a star restaurant they should think about this. but if you have a starter, 7 dishes, and a dessert, and at all of those you expect your guests to drink a very full glass of wine, i dont think you know your business. this means 2 bottles per person! and if you dared not to finish your glass they left it at the table. so at the end of our meal with 4 people the whole table was full of half empty glasses. and although i can stand some alcohol i am not sure what the dessert was anymore. for me this means you dont know what you are doing and dont care about your guests. after complaining afterwards by email they also didnt care at all which made it even worse."
"we headed over to de kromme watergang for lunch, taking advantage of the restaurantweek menu on offer. basic menu price came to € 42.50 per person, which is of course a steal for a 2* place. additional courses were charged at € 24 per course, which is in line with what youd expect at a 2*. so far, so go "
"de kromme watergang is close to the top of the dutch culinary olympus, hence the hope and expectations of our group-of-five on an unforgettable eating experience were high. well, the bill ran well over 600 euro for a 5 person lunch, so at least that part was in line with the expectations, but alas that was about it. food is excellent of course, but that is, at 2 star level, not enough. two dishes with cod and flounder were too small and not very special in taste nor texture. the combination of pork and eal was surprizing, but again very small. the wine tasting arrangement was also served in un- generous volumes and the wine choises were rather middle of the road. i guess it must be the adria tricks with mousses and foams that have lifted this restaurant to 2 star level, but as customers start to see through this, a re-evaluation and return to real value for money, is imminent and restaurants like this one will have to adapt or die. all in all the kromme watergang provides a formal, but not very warm and generous welcome. we wont return."
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.
friendly welcome and a nice location are the only two positive things i found about this plac 
- a limited choice menu-card.....1 for lunch & another for dinner. printed on paper and worn-o 
"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"this restaurant has a lovely location and to sit outside would be very pleasant on a sunny day. the interior is very interesting but can be noisy. food was fine without being special, but the service (by, i presume, the manager) was unfriendly, bordering on rude."
my wife and i visited this restaurant with high expectations but left dissapointed. the food was ok but the place felt very stuffyand you feel you have to whisper as there is virtually no atmosphe 
nice location on the edge of blaricum natuur reserve the restaurant has a nice pleasant cosy feeling with a nice terras overlooking the heather fields . food is well presented looks good but is not always freshly prepared . when busy service is slow
the atmosphere is a bit stiff and the service overdon so it feels not relaxed. the location is great for walks! rather expensive. not good for vegetarians. this is a typical dutch place. could be so much better.
"its a pity really, de goede gooier has everything going to be a very good restaurant: spelendid location, perfect setting, nice ambiance, good cook(s), if only the staff would try a little harde "
"very little to say since we did not have a meal, but the service was friendly and the coffee/tea good. ideal place to visit after a nice walk in the nature area next door."
on our first visit after the refurbishment the kitchen proved to be as good as ev 
"deciding to have a quick drink and some food in blarcium, we decided to go to moeke spijkstra. havent been there for a while as the last time it was avera "
orderd mint tea followed by an uitsmijter and salmon club sandwich.  both were prepared simply and tasted good.  reasonably priced and service adequate.
"moeke spijkstra is an authentic local haunt, great for locals, and also for visitors. the ambiance is as traditional dutch as can be - dark brown interior, as vincent van gogh might have experienced it, and persian rugs on the table. it feels warm and cosy, and there is plenty to look at. dont be fooled though, the clientele, typically in their 30s and 40s, are mostly television and advertising industry crowd. not a very welcoming and open lot. the food varies. our mussels were of very high quality and well prepared. also the fries were tip top. "
this restaurant is located in the very centre of town and thats the nicest about it. the dishes are ok but could do with a major overhaul on both presentation and quality!
"nothing special, very overrated, you probably have to belong to the incrodw to apreciate it fully. average"
"a very known pub among the people of blaricum and surroundings. here you can find unknown and known people, young and old, boy and girl. its a nice cosy pub. the dutch often call such a pub a brown cafe. a small town pub. they serve also food and i like the especially the sate. its not a top restaurant but a pub where you also can eat. if you want to eat on a friday or saturday, make sure youre in time and make a reservation. it could be busy. "
"we visited this place twice just recently, and unfortunately on both occasions i was not impressed with the food. here are some examples: pieces of warm bread which we received before food - were actually half frozen. pumpkin soup - i couldnt taste the pumpkin, it was more like a cooked sour cream of an orange colour. french fries - rather tasteless. i only enjoued the burger, and garnalenkroketjes - but why so expensive?!"
"in my opinion i can only say the restaurant has gone completely downhill. we went for a dinner this evening there were only four couples in total the entire evening, so not exactly rushed off their fe "
"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didn’t expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menù in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, it’s so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "
"- friendly, correct waite "
"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."
having lived in this village we went back for lunch without reservati 
i visited this place more often in the past. had not been for a long time but went here with the team (20 of us) in octobe 
"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
"this is an eetcafé old style. pub grub plus. with old style i refer to the food that is dripping with rich butter and vegetables a bit overcooked. however, the atmosphere is that of a local pub (good) and the beer is cold. not a place to go for fine dining but great for a quick dinner with steak and fries. not absolutely cheap, but hey, this is the heartland of very wealthy blaricum: the richest village in the netherlands on average income of its inhabitants. so do not complain."
its a brown cafe. its pretty noisy and limited choices of food. personally i dont like eating in- nor outside the restaurant on the small terrace.
this restaurant has a very nice feel to it and was very welcoming - pretty relaxed atmosphere which was good as we had the kids with  
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (€12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
food was decent the rest was more then terrible… service was the worst i ever had… menagment have big mouth so are the people working here… not recommend..
worst restaurant ever! we ordered a few dishes and then a different family arrived. after a hour they got there food and we still didn’t get any. i don’t recommend this place.
"the weather on this februari afternoon was inviting for a nice walk along the beach. after this walk we settled down in the outdoor seating area of strandrestaurant ff tijd. as the sun was shining, we had a nice sit down, albeit with our coats on, with a nice view of the beach an a calm sea. nothing could go wrong for a three point rating now, despite the prices of the simple drinks and food through the roof, the funny taste of the latte macchiato and the staff who clearly didnt enjoy their job. "
we ordered a simple “broodplank” and waited close to 30 min! ridiculous. the only plus is the proximity to the beach
"this is your average beach bar, nice to sit and have a drink. the kids love that they have a bouncy castle."

"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, don’t even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
the fries taste good. you can make a healthy deal with yourself: first walk to the end of the wavebraker and afterwards you deserve a fat snack ;)
"the staff is unpleasant, the food very expensive, tasteless and too greasy... i would definitely not recommend this place, or just for a drink !"
"terrible experience!! food was absolutely horrible! not cooked, appetizers came after the main course!! you need to call them like 2-3 times before they show up ( only 5 tables, with 4 service people)!!! and they have the nerve to charge, 4 stars restaurant prices!!!! they deserve minus 1 star!!!"
keep going until you find some other place!  it was expensive and really awfull! we were waiting 1 hour for the food and no credit card was accepted.
"this is your average beach bar. nice to sit and enjoy a drink in the sun. food is fine, but nothing out of the ordinary."
casual warm lunch offered by friendly staff. croquet and french fries and good selection of beer and wines.
"i liked the setting right on the beach, the weather was very nice and the food was fine. then came the bill and i did not initially notice it but when i looked closer they had charged me one euro for mayonaise that i had not even asked for. a very sneaky way to make some extra money and im sure most people do not even realise and just pay the bill. i pointed this out to the waiter who then became quite arrogant but did give me the one euro back. now this is not whether or not people can afford an extra euro or not, this is about the principle of charging people for something they did not order. not impressed and for that reason i will not be going there again."
"i had dinner here with my wife on a nice summer day. we sat outside which was nice. the food was good, but the service was somewhat slow. overall it was nice and i would give it a 7 out of 10."
"always when the sun is out the beach is crowed. the place is super cool, cosy and nice decorat "
"we had lunch here in august on a rainy day. we had a grilled cheese sandwich, prepared in a pan. nice, but to greasy for my taste. next to that we had ginger cheese pancakes which was delicious. friendly, quick service."

"the restaurant was recommended as “the place to be ” in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
we went to this place based on reviews and drove a good 30 minutes to eat here one evening. we both came away feeling disappointed after €110 meal for 
"the food is tasty and varied, but the idea to share dishes did not work for us. the brazed pigs cheeks with risotto had 5 nice meaty cheeks, but hardly any risotto. more risotto can be ordered separately as a side, but that brings the price to 20 euros. the stoba stew was mostly sauce and could have done with a staple. the naan bread on the menu is not the same as naan in england. as a thin pancake/pitta it was very little as a starter. so we left a bit hungry. having said that, the view towards the water and all the big boats going by is great. "
"excellent ambience and food let down by sharers pricing and relentless attempts to up-sell. ended up paying over €50 for small dinner, one small mineral water and one minute coffee. we did not ask for bill but over-efficient service left us feeling ushered out."
well the food was ok. had to ask for menu etc so service a bit slow. but it now has a order a few starters and mains to make a meal - but thats not what we wanted as we both like different food

one of many but a good place to sit. the staff is friendly and it is reasonably priced as well. not a bad place at all.

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"just after a long period of closing, because of corona, this restaurant started up. wher they usely serve a buffet, they now have plate service. the portions were very different: the sate was huge (almost for 2 persons), but the burger was tiny whitout any vegetables. my salmon was juicy en enough for 1 person."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my saté (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
"ok looked and smelt ok, spoke in english to someone who thought the best way to communicate with me was to shout at the top of his annoying voi "
"i accept that i cannot speak dutch but i would have thought that a seafood restaurant would understand what is meant by “fish and chips”! the young man serving seemed incapable of taking this order. i managed to place and order for calamaris but the second meal of “fish and chips” seemed beyond his comprehension despite a helpful dutch person trying to assist. finally by pointing i managed to place an order for the 2 meals which cost some £35.00!!! then when i tried to pay using my credit card i was told they don’t accept credit cards. however the machine refused to accept my debit card also! at this point having come to the end of my tether we left in disgust. we had spent the previous 10 days travelling through the netherlands, germany and poland and encountered no difficulties so why this fish and chip shop which is directly by the ferry port to england has such a problem with an order for “fish and chips” completely eludes me! i was also surprised that the senior staff working behind the counter gave the young man no assistance at all. i will definitely not return. "
"delicious fish. beautiful view on the waterway. its typical dutch way of preparing fish, which i love."
"we waited for around 50min. for 3 portions. there is no process and service. also the quality is very minimum, not what you would expect when going to such a place."

"vispaleis is a nice name, but it does not really match with reality. its more or less a luxury fish and chips-store. nice for a sunday-afternoon bite with the family, but not for intimate dining. a fishy snackbar..."
a quick bite before the ferry sit outside in the sun and enjoy the atmosphere of this small town square. good service and good food.
we were early for our boat back to england and thought wed have a meal before getting on the boat. the homemade speciality burgers at over 12euros were awful & probably bought at the lidl next door. my salad was very average - with chicken straight out of a packet & slapped on the plate. being charged 50cents for a glass of tap water was really mean - even the best restaurants we visited in the netherlands have never done th

"visited the restaurant with my family. the place looked ok. the food. the vegetarian option, stereotype goatcheese salad, wasnt tastefull. the much dressing. the goat cheese was weird. my daughter had a pizza, which was not well baked. the tomato soup was also not good according the youngest one. the pasta vongele tasted like it was baked in pan with me "
"food is good, waiter service is mixed. some waitresses or waiters are very friendly, while others are more formal. i think this is because the beachclub relies on the weather and seasons and therefore the personnel is probably switched more often. prices are average when compared to other beachclubs in the area."
"not often that i write a review for a below average place. staff here work at a snail-like pace and is generally not very capable (mess up an order and rather than fix it, blame a colleague). drinks took 12 minutes to arrive (busy beach day, but still). if you can avoid this place, do."
"yesterday i visited this place for dinner with my family. the waitresses were very kind and the music was nice. overall the mood was relaxed and good. unfortunately we had to wait about half and hour before we could order, because the kitchen was too busy. because of this we took as starter the olive- and brown bread with aioli and tapenade (which was great btw, very juicy olive bread) instead of carpaccio. the main dishes were, indeed, like those of an expensive snack bar; standard flavors and tough steak. it was the same for desert, i had the grand desert; the chocolate cake was dry and the chocolate mousse powdery. the only good thing was the look and the sorbet ic "

"bitterballen were nice. vlammetjes (springrolls) were too oily. chicken sate, the sauce was terrible. drinks were good and all the staff were friendly. just a place for a drink."
staff wasn’t very nice and the food wasn’t great either. i highly recommend you to visit another place to eat.
"quick, friendly service. the food was well to eat, not high quality, partly products from the freezer, like the firy grilled cheese sandwicg and the satay. the sfere was good."
"we ate here for an early breakfast - one of the few places available. wed eaten here before and had a lovely welcome and delicious food. on this occasion the welcome was fine (but less enthusiastic) and the food was poorer - so were were rather disappointed. most specifically those who ordered scrambled eggs were served chopped fried eggs on dry toast. service was reasonably fast. it is quite popular, filling up quite a lot whilst we were there. well probably eat here again, and give them another try"
"we had as usual a lovely time, took a while to get served our first drinks but after that it went ok. hubby had nice carpaccio, i ordered the calamari, was ok. but you would expect it to be fresh and not bought from the wholesaler. as i can buy it from the same place . but its a beach tent so except it. will come back, but order something else. "
"we were here last week when it was relatively quiet. sat outside in the terrace but it took 3 servers going back and forth before one finally took our drink orders. we found this to be very inefficient. went inside to order dinner and it took an hour for our meal to arrive. calamari was good, bread basket was nice, beach burger was ok, the mussel dish was disappointing. the mussels themselves was nice but the broth where it was cooked in was so sour, that you cant dip your bread in it nor eat the mussels that was swimming in it. complained to the server but just got a ill pass it to the chef response. no further reaction and no apologies received."
"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "
"as a family of 5 who live in the same house and are a household, we were allowed into the restaurant terrace but only on a table without cover. the outside terrace (with cover) had still several tables available, but according to the waiter those were only available for couples. when it started to rain we could no longer sit outside without cover. we asked to sit at a different location, where 2 tables could be merged. this was not possible according to the staff. we were forced to leave when the rain became unbearable. no other option was discussabl "
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"i’ve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didn’t really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"we enjoyed lunch at this place while sitting on the town square. my husband had the fish salad, that was really excellent. my mom had the asparagus soup which unfortunately had ham/bacon in it and shes vegetarian. both kids had a smoothie and a tosti, all fine. i had the vegetarian sandwich with hummus, and vegetables and then they added cheddar cheese. that simply does not go together. the bread was good but the sandwich was not great."
"arrived for a late lunch around 15.45 with a group of eight people & the staff took their sweet time to take our order. by that time (16.02) we were told that the kitchen would not be serving food after 16.00! if the waiter had told us that the kitchen closed at 16.00 we might have place our order immediately with the drinks order or gone somewhere else instead of wasting our time! the worst of it was that four of the group were guests there & were checking in, which was also why we waited to order. plus it was two minutes past four oclock, not really an issue for the kitchen i would have thought. very disappointing customer service."
"the restaurant is in a charming old building. the food was just not very well prepared and we did not like it very much. a huge portion of very salty smoked salmon as a starter, it was ok, but not the best quality, and as a main i had a pasta dish, which really is not to be recommended. other people at the table had fish, which looked ok, but was rather boring: it was fried fish, without anything added to it."
"we ate here with a coupon deal, fixed menu with a few choic "
"the beer was served by a lovely attentive waiter. we sat outside in comfortable chairs enjoying the sunshine. we did not have a big appetite so we shared three pieces of brown bread with fried egg, roastbeef and potato sausage. a bad choice. it was ok quality but a weird mixture."
"we stopped here for lunch on a sunny sunday, and there were plenty of people sitting outdoors enjoying the good weather. we all got toasties (look for the paw print in the bread!) as well as a beer. for lunch, it was a fine combination, but unfortunately service was slower than it should have been for such a simple order."
"always a busy venue but unexciting & rather expensive lunch food. i had a tosti which was awful, great presentation with a dog paw print embossed on the sandwich but the filling was hugely disappointing. how can you mess up a toasted sandwich! i would maybe go back for a beer but eat elsewhere!"
"we were there end of february 2014 for a homebrewed beer: kareltje. that is very tasty but a little expensive for o,25 l: 3 euro. friendly service, salties free and a nice little museum upstai "
"we visited this eetcafe with another aussie couple during june. it has a limited menu, friendly staff and a great atmosphere. meals ordered were spare ribs, which were very good, and the local fish, kabeljauw, which we thought was cooked well but not very flavorsome."
with a group of friends we had lunch and it was okay food. a club sandwich with chicken means thick bread with very thin and few slices of chicken. the others had much better food so perhaps do not take club sandwi 
"we ate here with a 2nd meal for free coupon, which meant that we had to order a 3-course meal, and then the cheapest starter, main dish and dessert would be taken off the bi "
"the restaurant is now named ons gheluk. we had a three course meal a la carte. the soups and carpaccio were nice. as main course we had codfish which was really good. for dessert we had a scroppino, cheese platter and chocolate soufflé. all delicious. the restaurant itself was a bit crowded and noisy. we had a nice evening."
"its 6pm we stepped in and two employers were dining. we waited for 10 minutes for the menukaart. the cafe interior was pretty; however, the food were in small portion, not tasty and expensive."
"a quiet sunday evening with only four tables being sat at...you would think our food order would come on time! the waitress did apologize & our table was given more bread but service, on the whole, was halfhearted. the food was mediocre...my veggie strudel, a  chef specialty was literally two stalks of asparagus with goats cheese wrapped in pastry....not inspiring. another guest had pepper sauce where the peppercorns would have snapped a tooth! so, on the whole, not somewhere i would rush back to...as the title says ~ disappointing."
"bad food, dont go there. food was dated and frozen the service was nice bud got sick from the food."
lovely restaurant peaceful setting and best ‘pannekoeken’ in the world. i chose the teriyaki one with beef with a nice glass of red wine and a small bottle of rivella. y 
we went in for a quick bite to eat. the exterior looked cozy and christmassy. inside you feel at home with the wooden furniture and warm lights. the staff is friendly and quick to help y 
"the strandpavilioen luctor et emergo is situated in a perfect location on the dunes of camperduin. great view, efficient system of ordering and paying (you order at the bar and get a numbered token). clean and modern; newspapers of the day available; we ordered a pea soup (erwtesoep met speck) and alas it was not up to dutch standards... maybe we simply have not been lucky"
"fletcher hotels offer a 29,50€ 3 course menu, with some classic courses like tomato soup, fish and chips, mixed grill, coffee with sweets. several guests were complaining about the meat: hard and dry like the proverbial old shoe. the fish also wasnt to the mark, a large thick crust on top of a messy conglomerate of hake. some of the desert seemed stale, leftover. the best part all in all was the simple soup. we regularly stay in fletcher hotels and often eat there. they dont offer top gourmet, but mostly we had no complaints. this was substandard."
"the hotel and the service was good, but the rooms some us 15 people got was small. nice staff and good food in the restaurant. the breakfast was okay too!"
had lunch her and the food was nothing special. i had the open face ham & cheese which could have had some more ham. my wife had a chicken dish which she said was just fine.
they can’t seem to deliver the food all together - why is it ok for half the table to eat and the other to watch - slow service - and a stinky smelly terrace allowing people to smoke which came inside the restaurant and stank - not worth a visit.
"after recommendations of friends, we decided to have dinner at wonders. unfortunately we were very disappointed as we had to wait for a very long time for our main course (but it was busy so we didnt complain). when main course finally arrived, we were told our kids were too noisy (they obviously had waited a very long time for their food to arrive). clearly, not a child friendly place (despite having a child menu so one would think otherwise). would not recommend going here with kids. very disappointing."
"had dinner here a few nights ago and was very disappointed. two of us ordered the peking duck salad which was a plate of soggy salad, even though we had asked for no dressing and 3 minuscule pieces of duck which you needed a magnifying glass to see. i complained to the waiter who said he would tell the chef. we of course never heard any answer or apology. the portions are very small here and i am not a big eater. definitely not worth the money!"
"the food was bad and the service terrible. they forgot almost everything. there were also things on our bill that we didnt have, and they said we did have them"
"we arrived quite late, the place was packed, i think there was not enough waiters, it was a total disaster. they were not nice, we had to wait hours for a soup for the kids and when i asked if we could have the soup at least for the kids cos it was late, she turned round saying yes it will come when it is your turn.. then when it actually came to the table, the soup was boiling! when our food finally was served, it was ok but not great and very expensive for what it was."
very negative!!! no menu in english. very bad attitudine of waiters. you don’t get what you order. very expensive. i strongly reccomend not to eat in this place.
"very nice place with good food. we were there with friends, about 15 people. the service was a bit slow and very inelegant in serving the wine..."
"we were on a 1-day-visit in bergen. i checked the trip-advisor-reviews before we chose a restaurant, so we decided to eat at fabels. at first sight we liked the charming and welcoming decor but unfortunately this was the only thing that was charming and welcoming in this restaurant. although we were asked quite quickly to order a drink, we had to wait an eternity before one of the waitresses (4 of them standing at the bar, chatting...) reacted to our waving, because we had to make a hand-sign before anyone would come to ask what we would like to eat. we almost asked ourselves if we had put on frodos ring, because we felt completely invisible. whereas the other guests (who spoke dutch) were treated kindly, we felt like undesirable strangers. the boss passed several times at our table, he didnt say hello, didnt ask if everything was okay, he ignored us, but he was friendly with the dutch-speaking guests. the food eventually arrived, it was okay, but not fantastic. we left as soon as we could because we really didnt feel at ease. far away from the cosy atmosphere that was described in some reviews. unlike our usual habit, we didnt leave a tip, because we really disliked the unfriendly and cold service. we wont go back to this place and we dont recommend it to non-dutch-speaking people. "
"we were there pretty early, but is was quite busy already. the tables for two were very close together. food is not too fancy, but good."
"crowded place indicating that the food is good. stay away from the nacho todos, but the spare ribs were good. so was the parma ham, soft and tasty. dogs are allowed inside and is not a good combination when it rains outside. smell wet dog."
"the place is nicely located - centrally in bergen ... it is indeed quite an intimate setting and one feels relax and at ease. the service was really good and quite attentive - job well done. the only reason we rate the restaurant as average, is as a consequence of the food. the appetizers were just ok but the main course was not meeting expectations ... some of the dishes had been too long in the oven or warmer and resulting in dry food ... not succulent. the burgers are great, but without any greens on the side it was a bit naked ... one small pack of fries to share with two is equally astonishing ... i wonder how that small pack of fries would have looked if there was only one of us to order the burger :) ! the bar and standard is quite high with us ... weve done a good number of places and this was not what we had expected. we will not come back even though we live close by."
nice menu but food quality is very poor. friendly staff.
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 € for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service ! "
we visited (couple) during the week for a late lunch - it was not extremely crowd 
"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didn’t get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you can’t book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz 
food is ok service slow but worse thing is people bringing thier dogs in .animals eat outside when we asked to move was a major problem
"tasty pancakes and waffles.  however i do not recommend waffles with ice cream and fruits.   coffee was ok, but not the best ever ;)"
"heart warming for parents and exciting for kids - here you get reasonably priced, easy to sell to kids type of food - pizza, pancakes, lasagne! : "
"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"
"tried soup of the day, 2 schnitzel, french fries and apple compote at the restaurant. reasonable good. good and friendly service."
noisy and not so good service. the food was okay! maybe a little bit early in the season for the staff
"this is a large, popular place in a nice location, though very noisy. nice atmosphere otherwise though. service was unreasonably slow and rather confused. dishes are served with chips and salad but these are charged separately and need to be ordered. quite pricey when this is considered"
the place was packed when we arrived and although we had made a reservation for 20:00 we were made to wait for a further 15 minutes until our table became availabl 
large centrally located restaurant in bergen. the atmosphere is somewhat in distinctive and bland. probably your best option for lunch in bergen however.
"we made a reservation for 9 people and were well received. the service was ok, but when we asked if we could order extra vegetables (they only had onions, mushrooms and salad available) the waitress could not help us. turns out everything is pre-prepared and ordered, so they simply dont have separate vegetables to grill. this was a problem because some of us have allergies. the steaks were very well cooked and tasty, but finding out theyre cooked in blue band (margarine) instead of butter (like they say) was another disappointme "
"big restaurant with an impressive terrace. first contact with staff quick, but sho "
"loetje is a restaurant chain, known for their steaks. my wife doesnt like meat, but she had a great steak at loetje near amsterdam. so, we went to bergen for the best steak ever. but i expected too much. the steaks was overcooked and cold. all the sides dishes were col "
"last saturday we had dinner at loetje in bergen. the weather was nice, so we requested for a table on the large outside terrace. there was some confusion and it took a while before the staff served us. we all ordered the famous steak, but when the plates came, one plate was missing. the waiter apologized and solved the problem as soon as possible. the steaks were nice, but not as great as we are used to at loetje. it is not yet the oiled machine like loetje aan t ij in the north of amsterdam, but it is still a young branch and they have time to improve."
decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
we went here for a beer and some foo 
"the service was nice, however nobody else except from us was in the restaurant. when asking whether the “schnitzel” was fresh, the service lady went back to the kitchen to ask and answered that it’s pork when she returned. a deep fried piece was served, dry and definately not fresh. we received one portion of fries where me and my partner should have received our own portion per person as this is what we where paying for. 16 euro for a deep fried single piece of (not even) meat is a joke. we’ve paid 40 euro for a portion of kibbeling and a schnitzel, a small coke and a glass of win "
"went here with mr. husband and little one. we were early, servers were still haring diner themselves in the dining area (don’t like that "
"from the outside it was already unclear. is it a restaurant or a snackbar. from the menu i would say it is more a snackbar. so i had a bit of difficulty to find a nice lunch.. still a very friendly, easy accessible place to eat and the new owners were doing their best to give good service."
"visited the restaurant on a sunday morning for a cup of coffee. i couldnt find a registration form at the entrance of the restaurant. after i ordered coffee at the collection desk, i was rudely asked if i had already completed a form. when i answered negatively, a form and pen were thrown at me. we finished our coffee and enjoyed the view."
"fastfood-style self service restaurant. a bit pricy, but food was okay. nice views from the deck. nothing fancy, but if you just want to eat, you can go here."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection. "
i found place itself somehow wear 
"it,s such a shame..we went to this part of groningen because there was an article in the volkskrant...one of the best fish restaurants in the netherlands.it was not worth the tr "
"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
"this was a nice enough cafe, although a bit too much like a school cafeteria. the ice cream across the road was great."
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldn’t really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"service was nice. food was good. menu looked quite balanced , better then earlier times we visited. having ostrich in hoogerheide who would have guessed?? portions nice. ambience little confusing but overall not a bad place to visit. if you stick to just a main course or the daily special moneywise doable . they even have special entrees easy to share! do not expect high cuisine , you will have a nice evening!"
"we got a feeling that our waiter forgot about us initially. at first before our order was taken, and then later on, after we finished our starter, the same thing happened. the restaurant was pretty full, but you would expect that the staffing is geared to deal with that. after we reminded the staff about the main course, it took another 30 mins. we had a good time nevertheless, but to really judge this restaurant it deserves another visit. the food was tasty, so i would recommend trying it."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happened…. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside… even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"i went there recently with family for what was meant to be a nice evening out however, i when i left i was not one bit happy or satisfied. i am not saying that this is a totally bad place. actually it is perfect if you want to go with children. it has a nice big play area for the children. the staff are very attentive and friendly. they talk with a smile and are polite. the menu is reasonable with a reasonable pric "
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.🐶 it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."
we went there several times.the menu is typical dutch.food is fine but the  service is very slow. their crème caramel is really good
"fish is fresh! that is good! waiters take their time and if you go during lunch time make sure your have several hours. it takes time at this place. the baked cod, gebakken vis, has a different coating than traditional... you must like  "
"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"new owner and style restaurant which we must try, a birthday was the right occasion i would say. we entered via the side entrance and started with a drink outside. that went ok, we had one menu and ordered from that menu… bit strange we did not get more menus but i thought they assumed we were going inside to order (as we said we wanted to dine inside). anyway, there were plenty of girls serving but they just did their thing and did not look around it was sometimes hard to get their attention. some were ok in the service but one was a bit clumsy. anyway, starters were about to be served so we went inside (still having a very nice look over the water-edge though). starters were a shared vegetarian bruschetta, shared meat-platter, paprika soup (soup of the day) and croquettes. portion size was quite good, the soup even came with two thick slices of bread. they kindly asked if the main could be served and those came all within a minute or 3-4 (not direct) accompanied with a huge portion of fries. we ordered 2x the spare ribs (very tasty and good), chicken satay with fries and fried rice on the plate (huge salad also), salmon with bearnaise sauce, sea-bass filets and tender pork fillets. the dishes were very well made up and portion size was more than adequate. after finishing the mains we ordered desserts, coconut with pineapple (it was some kind of coconut whip cream look, tasted great), chocolate cake brownie with white chocolate ice-cream, sorbet and 2x yoghurt with crumble and fruit. mainly the yoghurt with fruit was overpriced i would say. actually all the desserts but not to bad all in all. we had a good evening the bill did not break the bank and the food itself is really good quality, but the service was below par, in particular to the food quality. i do think the boss is in the kitchen and he needs some senior girs/guys to overlook the servers. than it would be the best food in the best place with great service, now we end with just not that. keep up the good work and youll get there chef!"
had a quick bite to eat at the restaura 
"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."
"ordered a tosti (bread with grilled cheese), but received one with ham. small accident, no problem, but we dont eat pork. mentioned this to the waitress, but was called a liar. they wouldnt replace the order.   great location, terrible service, would not recommend visiting."
"food was average, staff friendly, kitchen with low capacity & staff decided to serve two couples coming in later first such that we had to wait for little bit less than 1 hr for our lunch. by that time the couples already paid the check. only a sorry, not a normal gesture e.g. like offering the drinks for free. not coming back."
"... but still not the high quality that i am looking for in schouwen-duivenland. friendly waiters, good location, will be good in summer."
"too expensive, sharing one little salat and one little bowl of patatoes for 6 people eating spare ribbs at 16 €/person and nobody (not even the kids eaten an adult portion) felt ok with this plate, some spare ribs were half burned and the stuff seemed to avoid us as we got no bread and butter as others and drinks took a long time too. a little beer for 2,20 € is kind of ok if the service is good. but this place seemed to have enough business now with holland people so that they can treat german tourists as bad as  "
"the food isn’t half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didn’t eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth €15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now i’m sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks it’s ok to throw away €15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we don’t waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely what’s going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didn’t understand you. and i firmly asked what she didn’t understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i don’t need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way i’m waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw €10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."
"arrived at apartment 24 to find a dirty smelly apartment with dog hair everywhere, on the pillows , floor and curtains, stains on the mattress ,the floor was dirty too , ornaments had a deep layer of dust with dog hair in it too it was simply disgusting,the whole apartment needed a deep clean , you could tell that it just gets a cursory quick clean for a quick turnaround but this isn’t good enough goodness knows what cleaners they’re hirin "
named after a historic local poet the restaurant is affectionately decorated with antiques. dishes are on average both with quality and prices.
"we did visit the restaurant last weekend for the first time. we ate some mussels and deserts....the frecnch fries by the mussels were for one person, not for 2 and that was the same for the mussels....the portions were litt "
"we came there to try mussels menu advertised on the website of the restaurant. however it wasnt available. we ended up with gratin mussels as a starter which were good. the main dishes however were just ok, without any plus or minus. average salmon and pasta. i was very surprised to see in my pasta with gambas lots of bacon. good im not a vegetarian i though "
"sadly la plaisanterie was the only place we found open for coffee, in this pretty harbour square with its lovely, seasonally-decorated hous "
we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.
had a quick lunch here out on the terrace. salad was good and tasty with some fresh bread. service friendly enjoyable place to sit in the sun for lunch.
"everything is average. the coffee, the chocolate, the apple pie was a nice try. but overall in this ambiance and atmosphere is it really nice to be here. i think they have enough customers around so they dont have to perform at their highest leve "
food can be ordered (fastfood) by using the provided landal app. predicted pickup time however is totally inaccurate. in my specific case more than 35! minutes of
"we went there on a saturday evening to have a small dinner. the restaurant appears to be a snack bar with some tables. we ordered steaks, which were very very tough and way overcooked. the spaghetti carbonara was uneatable salty. the sharma was to salty and too much."
"the food was good, the staff was on and off in their friendliness. we went here twice in august. on monday evening the staff was friendly and quick to help us. on tuesday afternoon, they never seemed to notice my husband. he was in a wheelchair and couldnt just walk to the bar to order a drink. afterwards we found out that they were just with the 2 of them for the whole terrace. that was clearly not enough for a hot day in the high season. a lot of people choose to sit themselves on the terrace after swimming in the pool. the swimming pool was fun, it was busy, but that was to be expected on a heatwave day. "
"had dinner with friends there very recently. lovely ambience, a very comprehensive and original menu. the food was well presented and more than deliciou "
had a late afternoon ice cream and one time dinner. we like the interior and the terrace outside. also there is a small playground for childr 
"the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, very cosy and comfi sitting, loads of choice in pancakes and cakes (what we went for) a nice outdoor terrace. i found the service to be quite slow and not really synchronised in between the team. the food was good and well served. its not french crepe, its a dutch style crepe (deep pan and butter butter butt "
we ordered pancakes and uitsmijters. they were okay. the coffeemachine didnt work so i got tea but also a free coffee. they really did their best to find a way to serve coffee. so the people are sweet but they charge a bit too much...
"we had a ham and cheese pancake in this small restaurant. the pancakes are ok, about the same in quality ase anywhere else in the netherland "
"when going to the rien portvliet museum, the option for a late lunch my husband and i found in the island where the museum is located, was this pancake house. it seems that there are some other restaurants, but not close to the muse "
stopped here after our walk on the island of tiengemeten for a drink and a bite to e 
"went in for a quick bite during lunch time. friendly face service, accomodating to vegetarian request. glass of fresh orange juice (delicious) and a sandwich-bun with mozzarella, tomato, pesto(tasty and filling). together 10 euros."
"was a little less than expected, for the price, it is ok. i had a starter that was good, scampi, the main dish was trout and this was also good. the down side was the frys were only warm, the salad was very standard and the vegetables were overcook "
wow i can’t believe the service over there. we where with a group of 8 people. the food was cold!!! after we went to the club and they couldn’t find or reservation. jose and one girl came with the bottle’s with a bad attitude .. after all bad service never never again!!!!!!!!!!! rude employee’s
"this place has a really nice terrace next to the roundabout. we had coffee and vlaai here. what bothered me is the standard choices of vlaai, it seems no one in this part of the country haves an incliment to differentiate from the rest. its all the same everywher "
"ate here with friends during a cycling trip last weekend: the service is very good and the interior is great as well. the food looked amazing, but the taste was not really good: my fish soup was very salty and i presume my stomach cramps were due to this soup ;( my friends hamburger was also not very good, the price was around 10eur, but he received cheap chicken-nugget like patties on a bun. our other friend had no complaints with his hearty pancake."
"not good at all, but it’s a camping “snack bar” — so only use this if there are not other possibiliti "
"the paal6 has a lovely location right by the sea and is beautifully decorated. also the food is very nice, with some lovely choices and they are well prepared for kids too. unfortunately the staff, with some exceptions who were very nice, is quite unfriendly and inattentive. i think this is a shame, because if it weren’t for this, the place would have received 5 points from me."
22.5 € for a 150gr. fish is to much and the one gamba and four crispy cute chips was very funny sorry but that was a disaster dinner
we stopped here in the hope for a late lunch / early dinner but were informed no food could be ordered at that time - it was approx. 4pm. naturally we were disappointed and hungry! we did however stay for drink 
"went there for diner with family, food was ok but overpriced. you have to pay for the view, close to the beach. before 20:00 very noisy due to kids. service rather lame and not paying attention. dogs allowed. not recommended...."
"the paal 6 is a bar/restaurant on poles on a beautiful, seemingly endless beach in noord holland. it is one of the few beachside places to remain open during winter, but the surroundings are also very busy during summer. so if calm and serenity are your thing, maybe look a few hundred meters to the left/right: the beach is huge, and most people stay very close to the restaurant( "
"we recently visited the coast of north holland and after a lovely walk through the dunes and along the shore we decided to stop for some lunch. this restaurant is up on poles, nestled against the dunes, and has a beautiful view of the ocean. after a walk along the beach in december its nice and warm inside. on the afternoon we were there it was quiet on the beach and in the restaurant. the menu is typical dutch fare, paninis, some sandwiches etc. prices are high compared to other restaurants. the service was slow and surly. the food we ordered was fair to go "
monopoly? not used to public? not flexible enough to adapt to good weather? anyhow: more than 1 hour waiting for very regular food is really too much.  improve your communication skills please..... always the same when you place your order with electronic devices....
"my family has visited julianadorp almost every year since the early 70ies, and i myself have been there almost every summer for 25 years. as long as i can think, there used to be a really nice, cozy and somewhat retro restaurant at the strandslag de zandloper: the schip of tstrand, gaining its name from an old, stranded ship which had been converted into a restaurant some decades ago, later replaced with a more pragmatic, seamans style shack on wooden pol "
the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasn’t bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."
this place was not good at all. starter ( calamari) and kids’ pasta were way too simple and nothing special abou 
"i ordere tom yum prawns. it arived in a bowl drenched in half a cup of oil with no chilli, coriander, lime, garlic or ginger in site. when i brought it under the attention of the owner she rudely informed me that this is their way of cooking tom yum. i did not eat it but was billed €13 for it. restauranteurs like this are tipping their customers off ....but at their own detriment. they might cash in on us once but times are tough and and ignorant attitude like this will count against them on the long ru "
"we were there on our 1st eve. the place was not particularly clean (sticky table & papers on the floor). the meat-burger was ok, but the fish-burger was a fried thin patty taken out of the freezer - or at least it looked and tasted like it. no, nothing fancy about this place."
"food quality was poor. rice with the pokébowl was served as one big sticky bal. after feedback to the kitchen no excuse, nor any compensation was offered."
went here for a saturday evening dinner. it is located near a holiday park and therefore lot of people from that park were dining there with children. as the (nicely looking) interior is made of lots of metal and other hard surfaces it is quite noisy. the interior itself is industrial style and very nice looki 
"the restaurant is part of a big holiday resort. place is clean and looks quite nice. staff is very friendly. food is ok, but could be better. the choice of dishes is interesting, also trying to serve asian dishes and other out of the box stuff might be a bridge too far."
"came to this store to try the pizza take away service as our dog was not allowed into the restaurant. friendly reception and ample parking. pizza however was a real let down. pizza dough tasted like cardboard and quickly heated, toppings were ok. if you enjoy pizza go elsewhere or buy a frozen one in the supermarket. poor value for money. do not recommend! "
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really don’t understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
food was terribly overcookes and the selection was minimal. terribly below the standard of what you would expect if you spend almost 30 euros per adult.
we are here in the evening. the restaurant is just too expensive for what they serve on the buffet. it is not worth it.
"it looks like an amazing place with a wooden cosy house and a terrace above the sea next to the harbour, amazing food too. but then you find out that the owners are the most unpolite people you can find. we tried to order a beer and to enquire about the food but weve just been turned out by a guy yelling at us as soon as he discovered that we didnt understand what he was saying. the gesture was pretty clear though... very unpleasant and it ruins all the charm of the place."
"we visited bistro skal several times during a stay at the dutch coast. while the service was never particularly attentive and we ended up with half an avocado as a replacement for a falafel (!?), the service on the last day was one of the worst i have experienced. we dropped in for a late lunch at 3.30. there were seven of us, five adults and two children. the waitress was reluctant to give us a table as she needed it back at 5pm. anyway she agreed to take a quick order and we ordered drinks. when it came to ordering food, she flatly refused to serve a single portion of chips for one of the children. her argument was that she couldn’t profitably run a restaurant if guest just ordered chips. when we pointed out that we were also ordering six further meals she seemed initially more flexible, but the shutters went down when it turned out that one of the adult diners wanted fish & chips. that meal was only available in child size and there was apparently no option to adjust to adult size. we decided to get a takeaway from the place next door and while we ate outside in the sun, the table we originally sat at was empty… a shame as the ambience is very nice and it could be a great place to eat with children."
"there is an information button for each menu. but only half of the dishes actually have something about allergens. so i ordered a salad (which was on the menu twice, with two different prices). when i got the salad, it had different nuts in it. i asked the waiter to bring me a new salad, as i have an extreme nut allergy. after a short while, a waitress came and told us in an impossible tone that i had to ask if there were nuts in a dish. they would also charge me for the old salad and half price for the new one. there was no information about the contents of the salad via the info button and waiters could not be beckoned to the table either, as this was always ignored (we had tried to order drinks beforehand). in the eu, every restaurant and every snack bar is obliged to point out the major allergens. this includes nuts in particular! this information was not taken into account her "
never order any seafood her 
"we went for a long walk on the beach and decided to have a hot chocolate and maybe something to eat. the restaurant is outdated and furnished with cheap tables and seating and lacks warmth and atmosphere. a waiter came to our table and said drinks? no hello, no how are you? prices are high so we were thinking of leaving as we saw staff just wandering by, not really helping clients. but there was one, shall we say voluptuous lady, that did come to our table, said hello with a smile and started chatting so we decided to stay. unfortunately, the hot chocolate that we ordered had been on the stove too long so it was burnt but the kind lady immediately replaced it without questions being asked. we had some snacks as well (tosti, soup, sausage roll) and these were ok but we noted that the kind lady who served us was the only one doing her job. the rest just lingered near the kitchen. message to the owner: train your personel in hospitality and service (except the one lady mentioned)."
"went here for dinner, portions are generous and prices decent, not cheap but not overly expensive. also the quality of the food is quite good! we really enjoyed the dishes, made perfectly, portion sizes good and taste was perfec "
"wanted to have some nice drink and read a book. they had no coctails on the menu, so i ordered gin & tonic. they brought me the tiniest glass possible, i was able to pour not even a third of the tonic in it, so it tasted like pure gin. i had to ask for a bigger glass because it was undrinkable. they added the squeezing lemon thingy stick in the drink, but the lemon was stuck on it from the other side... so even though the squeezing stick is in your drink, forget about squeezing your lemon in the drink. nobody speaks english.."
"i visit ouddorp a few times a year, when the sun shines and ive been to c-side before for drinks. this time, however, i went for diner. i ordered a cheeseburger and the burger was horrible. it was obviously one of those packeged, frozen burgers,which can be ok. but it was nasty of flavour, with just a little melted cheese on a sloppy bun. there was a little slaw and a slice of tomato next to it, but not enough to hide the bad flavour. no sauce, no vegetables on the burger. i was shocked by the standard. i ate half of the burger because i was hungry but i did tell the staff my complaints about the burger and how i was unsatisfied. i asked to only pay for half the burger, because that was how much i ate, but the staff would not do so. the burger was €4,50, so were talking about €2,25, the price of a drink. she could have giving me a free drink, as a symbol. you want your customers to be happy and satisfied, right? when i told her that me and my friends (5 of us) would never come back, she did not seem to care one bit. which is her right, but having worked in restaurants myself, this kind of service is below standard and pretty shameful i think. the rest of the staff was quite friendly and they lost a big tip on this kind of behaviour. i hope the owner reads this, because he/she just lost a few €100 and a regular clientele over €2,25. not to mention the bad reviews well be giving. were taking our money to another beach bar."
"had lunch here last weekend. it was a lovely day, not too hot and behind the glass screens it was lovely to sit outside with views of the sea. we ordered large cappuccinos but were given normal sizes. they handled it well though and gave us a second cappuccino each. the sizes of the meals were huge. prices were good for the amount you get. dont expect anything fancy, but if you are looking for a nice meal on a beautiful beach, this is a good place to go. parking is close, as is a playground for the children. "
"sunny day.  weating time 1 hour for drinks en 1,5 hour for food. bad service people where leaving.  dont go here if you want to have a good time at the sea."
i can’t really say much about the restaurant or food as we waited for 25 minutes for a menu which never arrived & gave up! we asked two separate people & not one of them returned! so we left & went to zee down the road where we had a delicious meal & great service.
"beautiful seaside location. beach house atmosphere. slow and disorganised service, forgetting and mixing up orders. some members of the staff are rude, ( to be fair, many other are polite ). diverse quality of meals served"
"slow and unfriendly staff, takes too much time to clean the tables and food was okay. sorry, but no 1? we defenitely expected more..."
i was in the natural high for two times. once i was nearly not serviced and had to wait quite a while although it was not even half full. another time i got reseat 
we were there with the 6 of us. we ordered careys (some chicken and some gambas). tast was ok but ingredients were very poor.
"the food has no taste there (at least what we have eaten), but its very expensive.  unfortunately, our kids were foodpoisoned in our last day of holiday."
"setting great overlooking beach , food average ,,slightly short but vert friendly staff  good for lunch with surf shop next door , supper slightly disappointing with limited menu however still a,fun place to be"
"popped in here for a drink whilst our teens did the beach kite buggies. the coffee was very nice and staff attentive and friendly. the decor is really cool and of course views of the ocean were great. the food smelled nice (deep fried) but looked quite sad even though the menu was quite varied. we didnt eat here as it didnt look appetising. also, unfortunately the toilets stank. i could smell them before i opened the door.

"on evening of 30 august, 4 adults came expecting dinner and reasonable service in exchange for a reaonsable price.instead, we were met with a level of aburupt rudeness which none of had experienced in year "
"food not too bad, but when we were not sure if we should order dessert or not, their reaction in dutch was not very polite - they just didnt realise we understood the lingo! too bad we did..."
"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to €10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend €50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste. "
"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5€ (the wine only cost 10€). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"unfriendly service team, especially in you are not a native speaker. actually it was our second try there. but:  never again!"
"we know this place many years. in these days of our vacation we went there two times. the place has been renovated, which is looking very goo "
food was okay but really nothing special. we had a burger and some other stuff you have on the beach. was there for dinner on a weekday and didnt needed a reservation. not like at the sister location bijmarc the service was friendly and attentive. its a good choice if you are in the area and want dinner with a view to the sea.
basic bar food. good fries. funny tasting sauce with fish and chips and the sole. fresh salad. generally large portions.
"following many reviews we visited this store for dinner twice and were not really excited. this place is popular due to its excellent location on the beach. on weekends it is packed, many tables reserved and little or no choice of outside seating. during peak hours one feels the kitchens struggles to keep up the quality. had the impression food was prepared hours in advance and had been sitting a while. choice of menu good. great place for drinks and snacks. service friendly and helpful. great for a pit stop, less so for dinner. "
"called for a drink - took ages for staff to come and clear the table we sat at. the waiter then didnt really wipe the tables, just dusted everything on to the floor so you were stood in the previous occupants food remains. ordered a beer and prosecco- the prosecco was flat with no bubbles as it should have. when trying to pay no one came near us and in the end we had to go find someone to pay our money too."
"nice location with great and spacious terrace on beautiful beach however, food is just ok. service is incredibly slow and not motivated at all. smiling is not a common attitude here. upper notch price with low range service on a great location with many opportunities to improve. "
"even though the front side of the menu says ask our staff about alergens, the waiter had no idea what i mean when i asked if its possible to get a glutenfree bread. i asked also in dutch, he still didnt know. nevermind, imma have a salad. the salad was unfortunately drenched in oil, a green oily puddle was forming at the bottom of the bowl, large as soup. they have literally 3 drinks on the menu, managed to bring me the one i did not order."
"the interior looks nice. the view is nice as well. even though there were only 20 guests, it took the staff (4 people) 15 minutes to take our order. the food was mediocre and the prices were not. staff not helpfull, grumpy."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldn’t go there again. "
"food and service where really not great. blonde girl in service was really rude, she didnt even bother to explain the menu."
"very nice menus, but classical, nothing very innovative, special seervice in restaurant was very good indeed"
"had a fletcher burger in the hotels restaurant and found a piece of hard, sharp plastic in my food. the incident kind of ruined my stay in this otherwise nice hotel. will definitely not come here to eat."

"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
a nice place for a drink! but we received far from fresh seafood.. staff is friendly but the kitchen could be much better.
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the portions are very small. i ordered a vegetable dish that was very disappointing you could hardly see vegetables. everything is fluffy, none substance."
"we went there last night for my 61st birthday after reading the good reviews on this site. we booked for and arrived at 1900. by 2100 we had shared 2 very small portions (like 3 bites per person) and one bread roll. the food was interesting, but perhaps the two courses we ate were trying to be interesting rather than necessarily delicious. after searching the floor to finally find one of the two waitpersons, i told him we had eaten 2 very small dishes in 2 hours and it was too slow. he did not respond as far as i could see. we waited another 10 minutes, and then got up to go, just as our fish main course was coming out of the kitchen. at that (late) moment, the waiter offered us the meal without charge and tried to make amends, saying it was a new menu this week and therefore slow. but we were fed up (or not !) and did not feel like staying after thi "
"the place its self looks okay... but the staff behind the bar is terrible. they forget drinks a lot of times, promise to make them in 5 minutes and 15 minutes later you still dont have a drink... and when you go back they tell you they forget about it... again. and when they finally bring your drink its the wrong drink. if this would happen once i wouldnt mind... but this happend serval times. the bouncers are absolutely amazing and very helpful."
"we came here for dinner. it was ok. the service was friendly but very slow. i had the carpaccio burger and my husband had the xxl cheese burger. both burgers were ok. flavor was there but the sides fell short. the sides were fries and coleslaw they just seemed like an after thought. they aren’t very small child friendly but it was one of the only options to eat at when we got here. there is no changing table so if you have a child in diapers you will have to change them on the floor. we were seated outside which you are allowed to smoke outside so we were seated by a bunch of smokers. we wanted to be inside but i’m not sure why that wasn’t an option because we didn’t want to be by smokers while we ate. it’s a good atmosphere if you are single, married, or have older kids. seemed a little expensive for what we got. i wouldn’t come here agai "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
too bad these people serve fresh mint tea with lice twice in a row and debate that this is normal. giving us the feeling that we are very silly in our complaint.
"very poor service, long waitingtimes. enough people to serve but not easy to make contact with them. pasta truffel tasteless. icecoffee with no icecream allthough this was mentioned on the menu. they brought a new one. nice terrace."
"today, me and my boyfriend went out to get those famous b&j strawberries. we ordered 2 milkshakes and some separate strawberries. unfortunately, 6 people that were behind us in the queue were helped earlier, and when we finally received our ‘milkshakes’, they appeared to be smoothies... we asked the coworker about this and she very convincedly told us these were the milkshakes... the people before us ordered milkshakes as well and those looked conpletely different, much lighter, because there was milk in there... the smoothies were way too sugerary and we threw them away at the fitst trashcan we saw... this was our first and last experience with the b&j strawberries... also, the products are very overpriced..."
"terrible service. expensive subs, very long wait, toasted sandwiches are cold and not what we ordered. bad quality."
"don’t let the menu fool you... i’m from texas and know real quality. i obviously don’t expect it to be perfect here, but i do expect it to be close... and this wasn’t even clo "
"men and my boyfriend visited this restaurant do some lunch. the lunch menu seemed very big with nice choices so we were impressed. we both order the tacos. we waited a long time for them. when they arrived they were awful. they were not tacos. they were tiny wraps, with a small.cold amount of beef, tiny veggies and a dollop of sauce. 2 bites and one was gome. for 5.50 euro it was an absolute rip off. cold and tiny food. we paid and then went and got some spring rolls from a different place. we would never go back to this restaurant"
"the steak was cooked to perfection and was very tasty , but serving a steak with crisps !!! really ... very disappointing"
"for the price you are paying for this meat you would expect they would know how to season the meat with salt, they do not. the best thing on my plate was the garlic butter. the menu is only in dutch which i can kind of understand expect the other restaurants around them have english menus as well as dutch. my husband and i both got the sirloin and the temperatures were right for most of the steak. my husbands was a little under cooked towards the outside. the side they give you to go with a steak is lays potato chips....and you don’t get that many. potato chips and steak is not what i would say is a good combo. they give you bread before the meal with what tastes like ranch dressing instead of butter. i think a good steak does not need salt or a1 sauce and this steak needed both. very disappointed. do not recommend. "
"meet is usually good. it is always served with the same sauces, same butter, same crispies, same chips and same bread! this is so boring. there are definitely ways to improve."
"first i asked for a soup and it was water with a few vegetables in it, there was no salt or pepper so i had to ask a few times before it was given, the pepper was empty and we had to wait another 10 minutes before the waitress came rushing around to other tables to get her attention, the lamb at first had a good flavor with the dipping sauce which saved it, i asked for well cooked and as usual the dutch refuse to listen to customers and it was nearly raw inside, my husband got a mixed grill with all kinds of sauces poured over everything masking the chicken which was pink inside and one of the meats tasted strange like a liver flavor when you got through all the weird sauces they poured onto it, i had to spit it out and asked the waitress what kind of meat i was eating. i had to laugh while at the table because all the locals had body language as if they were eating at some fancy establishment, the soup also had a ring around the top, and i was scared the food hadnt been clean like our table. i had to ask many times for a napkin and when i gave the waitress at the end 50 euros of a 44 euro bill she came back with 2 euro 50 wondering where was the rest of the 6 euros. then i had to ask her 3 times to give me the correct change. overall it was truly a reflection of how incredibly awful the restaurants in holland are and how the locals eat it like its dog food and enjoy it. i was so sick to my stomach after we left too. gross!!!"
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin café. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "
"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the saté, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."
i have been here 2 times already. mostly very bus 
"called in for a quick lunch. food was good and service friendly. looks like the locals frequent, so that is recommendation in itself."
year after year the same menu. french fries could be better. service is very variable with ups and downs prices are above average.

this restaurant is unusually located in a former train station building next to the disused railway line (now a cycle path) which operated between turnhout and tilburg. the restaurant has been nicely renovated and now has quite a modern interior with plenty of space and comfortable seati 
"the other reviews suggested this would be a great restaurant in the vicinity but in our experience it was really not that great. the price shouldve warned me; 3 courses for 24,95 is a great deal; too good to be true. however i didnt realize this is the only dinner option they offered, so i share it here. let me start by staying the restaurant looks nice, the beers are great and the staff is very friendly. coming to the food however; the mozzarella at the caprese starter wasnt very tasty (and thats the main ingredient), the veggies and black angus steak tasted somewhat burned (even though it wasnt visibly burned) and the creme brulé was soft and mushy. for the price, it was ok, but with 4.5 stars on tripadvisor and compared to our dinner the evening before at den engel this one left is disappointed."
"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit ‘too much’. pick one of the more ‘traditional’ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"friendly service, but otherwise absolute rubbish. the food was poor and we waited 2 hours from starter to main course!"
"this establishment survives by location alone. beautiful views but the food is awful, hygiene poor (bar area, kitchen viewed from bar area and toilet facilities) and attitude of servers verging on rude. go for a drink maybe but don’t be ripped off by the price for rubbish food"
"we have often stopped here for a coffee or beer as the location is beautiful. the food menu is basic but if you are just looking for that then it is fine. what i was really surprised by was that the toilet facilities now cost 1 euro, even for guests of the cafe & then to add insult to injury there was no toilet paper & the area needed a good clean. this is totally unacceptable during the coronavirus crisis, everyone should have access to hand washing facilities...there wasnt even sanitising hand gel available at the entrance. this cafe did not fulfil the requirements set out by the dutch government for health at this time."
absolutely disappointing. beautiful location but poor quality food at a price for which you would expect high quality. clients need to pay for washing their hands which is unacceptable in the current situation of the corona virus. pass your way and pick up any other beach restaurant in renesse. 
"visited a gen ing last sunday when we took a break from mountain-biking. we just had some coffees and a tea and ice creams, nothing special to mention. tea and coffee were alright, we were served quickly and had a nice rest on the terra "
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"the location is nice and the menu looks good. however, the taste is a bit bland and uninspiring. we had a fine main course but especially the starter and dessert we just less then we expected for the price we paid. the staff is very kind and pleasant. the good service compensates the food which is why we give it 3 stars. "
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
terrible food and it took 1.5h to get the burgers. location is ok but also the stuff is not able to do their job.  never ever a next visit.
we visited teetied on a cycling tour. it has a nice terrace at the waterfront. so we stopped to have some drinks and a small lunch. the lunch chart is a bit limited but the view and location is very nice. we had some tostis and some drinks en enjoyed our stay. perfect place for a short stop-over. i would not recommend this if you want to have a extended meal or lunch.
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"i made a reservation through airbnb worth €906 (1 to 30 of april), i received the booking confirmation and two days later (4 days before my flight) the host canceled the reservation. i sent a message begging him, for not to stay on the street sleeping and the host didnt want to know. and my refund money only after 15 days. beware of bookings on this place !!"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"stopped here for drinks. nice location on the river vecht  looking at the lunch dishes it seemed a bit overpriced, lots of bread. well guess you pay for the location as well, nigtevecht is a nice place"
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"service was a little slow, but staff was friendly. prices are decent and the food is of decent to good quality."
had a quick dinner here during our boadtri 
"the ice cream is very good, however my son chose the licorice  flavor and ended up with gastro was definitely from there, so not very hygienic"
"arrived at 17:40, requested 2 for dinner. male manager looked at clock and said ok, we can try. while every other guest was on patio or at windows, we were the only pair put back in the dark, stuffy bar. when the server arrived with no menus, we stared at each other - we had to ask for menus. we put our order in quickly. as we ate, other orders came out with no issue. the kitchen was not closed. food was ok, not worth seating drama."
"grand cafe valerius sounds promising, but in the end we were not really pleased. service was very much depending on the waiter/waitress and the food just wasnt it. the asparagus with ham was much to salty as was the asparagus soup we had as an entree. and the main dish with risotto was to much we could bear: first cooked, then fried. our stomachs couldnt handle it and we didnt eat or drink for the rest of the eveni "
we were there on 2 consecutive nights & on both occasions it took 90 mins for our main courses to arrive. took the enjoyment out of what would otherwise have been good experiences.
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but won’t eat there again!
"we visited this restaurant this weekend. we decided late so where late with booking the table (same day). it took a while before we where welcomed by ever so sweet but very inexperienced girl. it was her first day so she told us. we had a table up stairs next to a window, it was very cold that day with freezing winds which literately came through the widow. it is an old building therefore not easily heated i imagine. we requested to change tables and this was no problem. we where served by an extremely friendly spanish waiter who clearly was there for the wines as this where he excelled in. i believe they where severely understaffed that night and this resulted in some errors on this front. we got offered a glass of wine on the house to compensate. i had some very nice pata negra as starter which was very nice, the accompanying selection of three kinds of bread with its toppings where well found. main course was a dry aged entrecote which i found a bit blend, even with the aged madera saus the taste was not very outspoken. as postre we had the selection of cheeses which where to cold and therefore lacked taste a bit. overall i think we where their on a difficult night for them and i do see its potential and where they are striving towards. i will return on day for a do over."
"kwalitaria is a chain of fast food restaurants (core business deep fried food and burgers); the kwalitaria schiedam is located in the almost one kilometer long shopping street mgr. nolenslaan. the restaurant is almost at the eastern end of the street. i have mixed feelings about this fast food restaurant. free parking in the street, a quick order at the counter, indoor and outdoor seating area and free wi-fi should attract customers. the food is what you can expect from a fast food restaurant so i got what i wished for, but maybe due to the layout of the restaurant, i didnt feel completely relaxed while eating my fries and salmon burger. however, as this is personal, dont let you stop this from visiting the kwalitaria schiedam."
it was quiet when we went here. staff was friendly and the food was tasty and nice. splitting the bill at the register was not a problem.
my burger was supposed to be a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg . i asked no bread to reduce the mount of carbs since i would be having the fries. no problem they sa 
"the person that took our order was very polite and helpful. we got our starters which was ‘okay’ but shortly after that our main dish was served while i was having my starter. which, most definitely, is not the right approach. the burger itself was twice as small as the bread, abnormal."
very bad service!!! everytime we had to wave for some service. waitress is only talking with fellow worker
old fries. old and too much coating and tiny meat in the hot win 
1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"one of the worst fast food experiences in my life. first of all was judged for not speaking dutch and only english, and asking for recommendations were ignored. the staff seemed to hate that they are working on sunday. then i was served hot wings but no fries. they forgot a two piece order with very few people or order "
"lunchroom soof offers coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, cake, breakfast and hot and cold lunches. what shall i say about soof. they have tried to make an as pleasing ambiance as is possible in a building, that was designed as a shop in the 60s of last century with a good deal of success. service of the waitress is prompt and friendly, the coffee is excellent and the cake delicious. cleanliness is ok, if you disregard the cobwebs in the bathroom area, so why the three point rating. the reason is, that i studied the menu and was amazed about the high prices of the food and drinks in this, lets face it, simple lunch room. even the bill for the cappuccino and cake was already rather eye watering, despite the good quality of the servings. "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"nice atmosphere, friendly service. let down by food quality. the meat dish was mostly good but the vegetarian was poor. undercooked corn tortillas, with processed nacho cheese sauce with what tasted like tinned salsa, with a few tortilla chips from a packet thrown on top..pretty poor effort for the only veg dish on the menu. veggies like nice food too, please try harder."
"was looking for a lunch, light meal. ater 17:00 only dinner menu was available. i choosed chefs choise, a steak. well made, but not more than a ordinary. got a good recomondation on be "
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
very central location. friendly staff. good food. interior lay-out is a bit different. some tlc could be added to the building.
visited here on numerous evenings with work colleagues. the staff were very accommodating and kept the drinks and bar snacks topped up and flowi 
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"theres not much choice of meat, fish and wo "
came here for a business lunch. the buffet offers a good asian style buffet with a grill to prepare stir fry and also has some typical dutch favorites offered.
"we were kicked out before i could finish my drink (or pay extra time) the place was practically empty at that time so i didn’t think it’d be a big deal to relax and finish my drink. it ruined the mood. friendly and helpful staff though, but rule doesn’t work for me. i wouldn’t return."
"we visited this place for a birthday dinner. the location is good, near the water where you can have a good look on the ships passing by. free parking nearby. it was too cold to sit outside, so we went in and were pointed to a table by the friendly staff. inside looks a bit daft, but its part of the experience so to speak with stuffed bears everywhere. ;) some bread for starters, which was good and fresh. several house wines are served by the glass. i ordered the chicken sateh dish, which was simple but good. the fries were a bit cold, but this was solved quick and in a correct manner by the staff. reasonably priced."
this is a reasonable restaurant open late for something to eat and drink.
"they are in the center, and the people are friendly. good beers, sandwiches. nothing special, but very agreeable."
"we’ve been talking about this restaurant several years, finally we’ve visited this restaurant a few weeks ago. the setting of the restaurant is superb, in a quiet green surrounding, almost in the middle of nowhere… as aperitif we had ruinard, one of my favourites, with nicely presented appetizers, a nice start! then my scallops arrived, the first preparation was superb, the second (warm) was overcooked. also my langoustine as second course, first preparation tastes good, second overcooked again. pigeon as main course, could have be tasteful, if it wouldn’t be too salty and overcooked yet again. and to finish a dessert based on blood orange which gave the impression of lack of inspiration… very classic and too heavy me "
25 euro for all you can eat. chefs will prepare special dishes for you. ready food is not allways full which is little bit dissapointing. there is a lot of seats in this restaurant so you will allways get a table. ice creams are really nice. overall 7/10 -3 because food in not allways full

let’s start with the go 
welcomed at the door we were taken through to the lounge overlooking the water. we were offered a special moet et chandon. some delicious bites were served including an impressive kroepoek snack with great tast 
"the restaurants interior feels like a hotel. not really nice decorated, certainly not up to date. the food is ok but certainly not 2 michelin stars worthy. it seems michelin holland is not as strict. compare this to any 2 stars in belgium, france, spain and you will be disappointed. maybe its trendy go give a raw carrot, cowlyflower etc... as amuse, this is not what i want in a 2 star restaurant. the food was also to rich, heavy, totally not my style. the quality was certainly not bad, just not refined enough."

"one bite out of the fish selection: very overdone! hows your meals? she asked overdone! nothing more! no offer to redo, another selection? nothing! 10/06/2018"
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they aren’t attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasn’t friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldn’t answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help they’d just say “i am the wrong person to ask”. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "

there was only tapas and you can choose from 6p different bits of tapas. in total 14 for euro 4 
the scenery in the restaurant and on the terrace is very nice. the staff is friendly and accurate. the menu gives a variety of both dutch and international dishes. the winelist is simpel but effective. the price for a simple houswine is over the top.
"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paid…..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"the café has a very cosy atmosphere and is situated in the lovely village of de rijp. the service is friendly and ok. the food choice is limited though, good but not exceptional."
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!😡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15’ for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! don’t waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "
driving around through the polder i decided to eat an early dinner in urk. i landed at the kaap near the lighthouse and went to this fish restaurant with view to the lake/sea si 
"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. it’s definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "
we had not been to urk for many years and decided to revisit urk and enjoy a good fish dinner which should be easy considering that urk is a fishing to 
"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
25 euros for a couple of welcome cava’s 
"not that exciting, service was not too good for this price and staying outside for a drink was not an option, the terrace was almost empty!!! hate it when there is no flexibility. the food was for this price average and the service too. the wine was ok, but altogether it was an average experienc "
"trendy place, nice interior and decent location ... but some quality details made it for me rather average nouvelle cuisine. service can be better, given the price tag you finally pay for these kind of restaurants. and im used to eat from the best brasseries in town till michelin* starred restaurants. not bad, it needs extra attention."
i was invited by a friend to this restaurant which has a great ambiance and good service. however this quality was destroyed by a worm in my fish on the service plate. i guess this was one of the worst experience of my life even this may not be restaurants fault. even the waitress took care of this immediately they did not do anything ekstra for the apology except a free coffee. they could do more for this kind of scandal which will be one of my worst memory...
"nice location in a former pumping station, good food, but very overpriced. one waitress was very accommodating and friendly, the others were distant and cold. we had to wait while one of them put our coats away before we were seated, which took a long time. food was good, but looked better than it tasted. found the whole place rather pretentious and would not likely return."
"definitely not worth a part from the nice furniture, decoration of the interior and exterior sort of church on the si "
"portions too small. owner not friendly, she couldnt even tell me what the dessert was, she only said...its sweet. the cheese tray was small and no explanation as to what cheeses."
"went here for an anniversary dinner, wednesday night in the summer, ate outside in the quiet evening in what is almost a park. food and wine were great, especially lobster bisque, and the service just fin "
"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
"we came with friends and family to this place and we were very disappointed with the service. our order was incomplete, the waitresses came to our table with different orders... they didnt know who order what.  it was a mess."
"this is a nice place for a drink and/or a snack. even dogs are welcome here. many people come here by bike or by foot. some even by horse. i didnt ordered a meal or so, but some beers and snacks. it can be very busy here and the staff is sometimes not able to help everyone as rapidly as they would or as fast as the custumers would like to. the woods surrounding the hut of mie pils are also nice for a walk. if you translate the name it means something like mie beers cabin. mie is the former female owner. "
"this is the place to be when walking in the woods or cycling the area. outside seating is great, buzzing place and good service. quality of food is poor but just come here for a nice belgium beer."
"horrible. i wish i could put minus 5 stars. today we went there for first and last time. before the order we asked if we can pay by a pin card. the waitress said yes and we proceed to order 2 hot chocolates. before we leave, i went inside to pay the bill. a woman informed me that i can pay only by cash. i explained the whole story but they didnt want to admit their mistake and made one of us to stay to the bar and the other one to go and find cash and pay the bill (5.4€). the closest atm from there is about 2,5 klm, and i had no car. so i did all the way back and forth for 5 god damn euros and it wasnt even my mistake. they didnt even apologised for the inconvinience. only a retard can do that to a customer. theyve ruined my day. i would like to go back and punch the owner. please shut down that place and give the keys to someone who knows about how to run a business. so unprofessional. an advise to everybody: just take your own food and eat it near the lake. do not waste your money there. it doesnt worth."
"we visited already several of the loetje restaurants, renowned for their steaks, and down-to-earth experien "
decided to try this place as its loc 
"we decided to drop by to a dinner because it was pretty crowded. we have to wait for a table about 10 minutes and then got a nice table at teracce. we ate beefsteak (they have normal and xl, hama fish with french fries as a side dish and indonesian beefsteak with batat which is a bit spicy. the food was pretty good, we drank tap beer pilsner, but they do not have dark beer in 0.5 bottle (or staff didnt know how to explain)."
"we visited loetje breukelen while on our way to amsterdam. we had to wait quite a while for a table as it was fully booked. as we did not made a reservation that is on us. loetje breukelen was recommended to us so we were quite anxious to get a table rather sooner than later. the food is basic but good. the restaurant was clearly understaffed which resulted in longer than acceptable waiting time for ordering, service and checking out. which is a shame. the overall impression on the food is ok. we missed some inspiration in the lay out of the restaurant and the overall service. it felt we were just a number of visitors. too bad as the potential is clear. work on it."
"we like what the new owners did to this place. it used to be zizi and is now part of the small dutch restaurant chain loetje. the use of wood (beams, floor, stairs) and rope (staircase sides) gives the interior a warm look and feel. the chairs could be more comfortable. the waiting staff is friendly and attentive. food portions are fine. most plates are basic. you can order extra veggies or a side of fries, but the main dishes dont come with them. if you do, the price of a meal goes up to a bit above average. the location is great though."
"we used to visit zizi that was the predecessor of loetje. the menu is a lot different (and a bit pricier), more towards steakhouse food. but they also serve various lunch/brunch sandwiches, salads, pastries, starters, main dishes, side dishes and deserts. you can also go in for drinks with snacks or for a coffee/tea with or without a piece of apple pie. it deserves a chance in this location (close to the bank building that will co-house a hema in the future)."
"booked the restaurant to catch up with someone and had hoped for nice weather so we could have drinks and dinner on the terrace on the vegt. unfortunately, rain so we sat in the conservatory, which was also fine. the hostess came by every 10 minutes with the same question, have you already made a choice?. it was still quite early, and we were still enjoying our drinks and kept indicating this. it was a bit irritating and at the same time also funny. we finally chose a four-course menu with cheese for dessert. each course was delicious and beautifully prepared. the lobster bisque had a good taste. also, during dinner, our hostess was irritatingly present by constantly wanting to sell glasses of wine. the location definitely gets a 10, and the dishes are well flavored and very tasty. the service staff, on the other hand, needs a refresher course in hospitality."
"everything is superb except the guest friendliness. that is why 3 stars, sorry, but costumer service is very important."
"beautiful location. the food is okay but not special. value for money is insufficient, ( 2pax, three course, 150 euro)the bill was incorrect, we had to mention it. and even after we left, we found out they still charged the tasting menu to high. vibes are a bit arrogant."
"we had a family gathering at this restaurant and were thrilled with the setting which is right by the river so outdoor dining was possible in the gorgeous weather. the service was excellent with professional and friendly staff. it suited us for the occasion for it to be slow which indeed it was. we were there for over four hours for a three course meal. the food itself was excellently prepared and cooked but unfortunately, the helpings were so small we felt the a la carte courses provided were more like a tasting menu. very disappointing considering the high cost. if the owners would just be a bit more generous with their vegetables, accompaniments i would be happy to return. the cheesboard contained four tiny pieces of cheese and one tiny slice of bread. wine started at around 28 euros a bottle and the wines we chose were excellent."
"after visiting mos in amsterdam we new it would be hard to beat, and werent wrong. we went for the taster menu and unfortunately it was a real let do "
the service was so terrible !! we ate all bread and still waiting for the food ! the waitress did not have any idea what were the ingredients... never again..
"we had diner here on a sunny evening in august, arrived by boat, parked in front of slangevegt. restaurant looks very nice, location and view is spetacular. we had a lovely table outside next tothe river. nice staff, food was nothing special, in fact we were somewhat dissapointed, very plain taste. recommended on sunny days only."
"we had dinner there this week. we started with 2 glasses of cava. we both had the slangevegt dinner menu of € 37,50 a person. it was the lobster bisque, the iberico pig, and the ice-cream with mango. the bisque was served in a champagne glass with cold foam on top. it was very salty, too salty to finish. the piece of iberico pig that my partner had was almost half fats. the ice-cream was nice. the service could be better for a place like this. we had to wait long before we were given the menu and received the menu after we had already finished our cava. i had a wine suggestion with the first 2 courses. while not having finished my first wine yet, the second was poored and the unemptied glass of white wine was taken aw "
"we had a group dinner here. the style of food was cuisine, nicely presented meals and a nice ambience in the restaurant. on site parking was convenient and the service was quite good. there was not a lot of choice in the menu and although the food was nice, i expected better for the prices we paid. would try again for lunch to see if experience is better without a large group on a busy night as it is a nice location."
"this place is all about the location - its pretty and if the sun is shining you can sit by the river watching the boats go by, a beautiful way to spend an eveni "
very nice location in one of the most expensive area of the netherla 
"we had dinner at slangevegt with a party of four. the restaurant breaths a cosy atmosphere and we were guided to the back of the restaurant where we were seated at the window overlooking the terrace and vecht river. after having an aperitif (we were not offered any hors douvres) we had a starter - i myself had lobster bisque which was served with a scallop - which was good and after that a combination of iberico pig and gambas which was even better. a pity that one of us missed forks and the other knives when the starter came. also, nobody bothered to bring the wine menu so when the starter came, we didnt have anything to drink. then, we ordered a dessert - i had cheese - that took extremely long to arrive. the waiter apologised by offering a free glass of porto which was a nice gesture. anyway, all in all a couple of service flaws but then again, good food and a nice venue. could be a very good but at the moment, slangevegt does not reach that score..."
"the service at this place was terrible. we reserved tables for 21 people, we were assigned 1 young waitress and it took the 2 hours to serve the first course of the 4-course menu."
"i have been going to slangevegt for over 3 years, mostly business but occasionally for pleasure. i always come away feeling like a person whose lover is beautiful but just gives enough to keep you coming back. i just dont feel the love. service overall is not bad but for crying out loud, a menu within 10 minutes wouldnt hurt. the staff are generally very pleasant but need to connect more often with the table- seems i need to ask for service instead of the other way around at times. the food is tasty but overpriced. like many aspiring dutch restaurants it tries too hard on presentation and form rather than taste and value. stop making a show and serve decent portions for main courses. i am not paying for cuckoo spit. you would starve without the appetizer so you will need to order both starter and main course to stave off your hunger. food is very good overall- i just think they should serve more simple quality and manly portions in a timely manner. i expect much more for what i pay but no taking away that this remains a unique restaurant in a beautiful location . like a lover however, no matter how beautiful, you need to start giving something more to keep me hanging on. "
"slangevegt is always a good place to eat or relax at the terrace on the riverside. unfortunetaly the service is very bad. the waiters act like they are the costumer instead of you. thats a pity because the whole formula is great, so i hope there will be some progression made in the service level during thiswinter. when i come back next spring i might reconsider this review."
"keep going back as i love the location and hope each time things will get better with regards to food and service, but no still a big let down. the service is so slow for a 7.30pm booking we still did not get the main course till nearly 10pm, prices are really high for what they serve and the scallops were most definitely frozen not fresh. what ever i say people will still go there because the position on the side of the river and the ambiance is lovely, they just need to tighten up there act. still would reccomend just dont expect value for money or be too hungry!"
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the saté and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didn’t, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service you’d expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also à la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays €3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."
the hot 
the formula of van der valk is renowned in holland. much food for reasonable pric 
"pleasent reception, clean rooms,uncomfertable bedding, adequate restaurant,  but seriously: no pasta? breakfast not included, good average."
"had a quick sunday afternoon drink with some family. to say that the service was poor was an understatement despite plenty of staff walking around. had to ask for drinks and for finger food, almost begging. drinks and food fine, service not"
"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay € 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"fast food near the highway.  just a pitstop or a quick leg stretch.  inefficient staff, not very friendly.  food in line with other restaurants."
the veggie burger  was chicken!  and the fries were cold  very unsatisfying and disappointing the waste bins were full so we could not dispose of our food
"usually we came to mcdonalds only for the drink or ice but this time we took mc veggie, too. its not bad at all. service was oke though its a bit slower than normally mcd."
just wanted a mc muffin quick without bacon and a small coffee. ordered and there was enough staff standing there. it took them almost 15 min. really unbelievable. next to that the bread was dry and probably it was to long cooked.
"i went here twice for breakfast as we stayed in the hotel next door, but i must say that it wasnt really fast-food. i had to wait a minimum of 5 minutes for my breakfast order. quality was as expected and the service is the same everywhere."
"seemed to be the only show in town (italian restaurant closed and another one not serving food on saturday after 18.00 ??), never a good thing. long wait, mediocre food, mediocre service. wont rush back."
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."
"attempting to elevate from the level of chips shop, this restaurant leaves a confused impression. its neither this, nor th "
"this bistro is perfectly in an old building directly at the village center. nice terrace to sit outside, if the weather lets you with very attentive staff and good food. nice choice of beers and correct wines."
"average dining and drinking establishment. family friendly, reasonable prices. a bit too loud if you prefer a quieter atmosphere."
"this nice place looks at the beginning like and old english pub, in fact has a good selection of beers. food is also classic of a pub, but with some taste specialties. service is welcoming and quick. definitely worth of a stop if you are on the way."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; it’s just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
"the good news is that de beren eetcafé is easily accessible, because the restaurant is situated on the n209 main thoroughfare, close to the bleiswijk ramp on the a12 motorway. furthermore, a spacious parking lot with free parking is part of the restaurant complex. more good news is, that a three course meal is obtainable for € 19.99, value for money in a dutch restaurant. the restaurant is spacious, but the atmosphere is a bit like the burger king, if the burger king had put in a bar and went with the appointments for varnished wood. furthermore, too loud music was being played over the loudspeaker system. the bad news is, that the service and food left much to be desired. service of the staff was pleasant, but a bit bumbling and unpolished (not unique for a dutch restaurant) but broke down completely after the main course. we had to wait 20 minutes till the table was cleared and another 10 minutes till a member of the staff noticed our presence and took our order for dessert. in the mean time, members of the staff were flitting past our table, carrying plates with spare ribs (it was unlimited spare ribs evening). the same thing occurred after the bill was presented. it was impossible to attract the attention of the staff to bring the change. in the end i went to the cashiers desk and got the change there. keep in mind that the restaurant was not understaffed, but insufficient attention was payed to individual tables. about the food: after a promising start, carpaccio, (again augmented with spurious ingredients and salad leaves, but that is, unfortunately, the dutch way), the main course, tuna steak, (one of my favorites) was a disaster. the desert, chocolate nut cake, was of supermarket quality; a helping of vanilla ice cream along side the cake could not mask that impression. furthermore, my table companions complained to me about the substandard quality of the pork and that too much salt was used in the peanut sauce. the reason that i had selected de beren eetcafé in bleiswijk was that i had visited a sister restaurant in schiedam a short while ago (see my review) and was impressed by the skilled cooking in a unpretentious atmosphere, but de beren eetcafé in bleiswijk was a disappointment and we will keep to the schiedam branch in the future."
"really nice location, with normal but good food. the menu has the standard meals like carpaccio, soup, steak, safe and salmon. service is really nice. they were extremely quick with drinks, starter and dessert but for the main course we had to wait longer which was hard for the kids as they were hungry."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck

"we went for a family birthday lunch on a sunday. we choose the restaurant because it offers an a la cart menu; because some of us don’t like fish and would like to eat the vegetarian or meat options. arriving at the restaurant, we had to call twice before they would open the gates for the parking lot. this should have been a warning. one of the tables was unsteady, so we asked for a coaster to support the table. they promised to do it immediately, but instead were busy discussing the daily life. we asked again, and got a rather annoyed look from the staff but in the end did receive the coaster. when we received the menu, not all of us wanted the surprise 3/4 course menu or the regular 3/4 course menu. since the waiter didn’t inform us that those two menus were the only options, we wanted to order a la cart options, but were informed in a rather condescening way that this was absolutely not possible. only when we said that most items on the menu for a certain member was not possible, did it become possible if the whole table would make the same order. although we did receive an apology for that choosing a la cart options was not possible, we thought the communication was bad. in the end we selected a couple of courses from the chef’s menu, and we also added wine for each course. we received the first two courses within 2,5 hours, and asked for a cheese plate prior to desert. it took 1,5 hours before we received the cheese plate; by the time we asked for the cheese plate again, it arrived within 10 minutes and the desert arrived 15 minutes later. we had the wine with all the food, except with the desert no wine was given. and when asked for it, it was too much effort to arrange it for us (even though they receive a fair amount of money for the wines if they had arranged it for us "
"we celebrated our weddings day there, ordered a surprise 4-course menu. unfortunately not surprised. the wine selection was good, the beefsteak was too raw and bitter, cheese too simple for a surprise. i do not recommend - a good service though."
"food is well prepared, good taste and textures, executed with great flair. really wish ingredients (beef) could have been better quality.  service is sketchy, from slow to patronizing."

"where to go on a monday evening? we thought we would like to come back at savarin. it became a big disappointment. the new decoration made the restaurant very noisy, also before the big group entered. it is hard to handle such a group without spoiling the evening of the others, it became clear the staff couldn’t. for half an hour no table was actually served in the whole restaurant. the staff appeared more instructed than trained, saying the right things on the wrong moment. also with good intentions it is hard to work in the wrong setti "
"as we live in old rijswijk we thought of giving this restaurant a try. the quality of the food was very good and the very young and rather inexperienced waiters did their best in a satisfactory way. our problem came with the dessert. there were two desserts of choice: one based on blueberry mousse and sorbet, and the other based on cheese panna cotta. we all ordered the panna cotta, but, t our surprise, we were all served with the blueberry mousse. we notified the waiter who obviously didnt know what to do, so he went back to check with his superior. when he returned to our table he started explaining us that the blueberry sorbet is in fact some kind of cheese panna cotta. as we didnt like to be taken for idiots, we asked for his superior. when his superior came, he had a very arrogant and patronising attitude and restated that the blueberry sorbet is in fact the panna cotta we ordered. he was very persitent and i had to confront him with the menu to make him admit that there was some confusion. this attitude is absolutely unacceptable from somebody working in services and who has the minimum respect for his customers and for his job! but apparently the guy doesnt have any notion about respect as he was trying to lie us up-front."
"chefs of restaurant savarin, part of les jeunes restaurateurs deurope, not only display culinary craftsmanship oriented on european gastronomy but also use organic ingredients. a special voucher action brought us to savarin, where they served us a three-course menu with veal as main course. the meat was tasty, it had a reasonable quantity and was complemented with only one asparagus, a little heap of sweet potatoes and a tablespoon of mushrooms. it seems that savarin only likes to fill up the restaurant, but refrains from attracting new customers with voucher deals. the price for this menu was too expensive for what was offered to us."
"visited restaurant savarin with our birthday party. from the moment we made our reservation we experienced the poor quality in service of the restaurant staff. a 3 course dinner is rather expensive at euro 49,50 and contains no special dishes, but the frustrating part of the evening was the coffee/tea. coffee was served without the sugar/milk tray for which we had to ask at the bar, but most of all the sweets were served after we had finished our coffee. btw. we did not order the friandises, but they were put on the table without asking. i mentioned that we were given the friandises after we had fisnished our coffee to the head waiter and he said he was sorry about this, but that was it.

"i usually only write reviews when i really liked a dinner, but this time i was so disappointed that i make an exception. we had thought about going to the savarin restaurant for some time, so when there was a special voucher action, we figured it was the right time to try. unfortunately, it is obvious that they are not trying to win new customers with their voucher deals, but just to fill up their restaurant. while the food was tasty, the menu was totally basic, so that in the end the price we paid with the rebate actually still felt overpriced. but ok, i understand that they cut a few corners there and you just dont get as good a deal as you had hoped. what really surprised me was the level of service. it starts with the fact that they put way too many tables in the restaurant, so that the servers have to squeeze between the tables. guests are constantly moving their chairs because the feel they have to make room for the passing servers. of the three servers we had only 1 was close to the standard i expect from a restaurant with a 50 euro menu. one forgot was on the plate when trying to explain the main course, the other never bothered to ask whether we liked the dinner when removing the plates. the waiter did not see when glasses were empty and it took ages to be able to order drinks. not just for us, but also at the surrounding tabl "

visited the restaurant and although the food and wine were nice t was way over priced. most wines were in the €30-45 price range and frankly they werent bad but i have had way better for wayyy cheaper. the food wasnt bad but 2 days after my visit i already have a hard time remembering what we had. more inspiration is needed to make this resto living up to its nam 
"this restaurant pretends to be upscale, but serves poor quality food. our group (15 people) had to wait more than an hour for the main course because as the staff explained they had a lot of guests to serve. which made me wonder what we were.... this place has to learn a lot about food, very poor quality and serving guests."
"my parents were celebrating their 63rd wedding anniversary with my siblings at de wits on 28.08.2021. i could not come as i live in the uk. i called the restaurant, while they were having dinner, to order a bottle of champagne as a surprise for them, offering to pay by credit card. regrettably, the person answering the phone at de wits (i guess the owner/manager) said no, i cant do it as im too busy, and theyre all drinking fris (soft drinks) anyway. not only does he turn my business away, but he seems to feel entitled to decide what his guest should be drinking. some attitude, h "

"a restaurant like many others, nice service and average cuisine. the fish of the main course was slightly smelly, the starter was ok. all in all not unforgettable!"
"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros •	nice terrace in busy street •	excellent wine is available •	service is good •	prices are realistic, not too high  con’s •	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"
"good beers and decent food. nice and friendly staff, pleasant place to enjoy the evening when you are around rijswijk central."
"had chicken burger for about eur15; came with fries and small salad. sat outside on the terrace which was good in the heat - although the serving staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves rather than attending to customers. had to constantly flag them down, for drinks, cutlery etc."
its located in walking distance to the winston hotel.  the drinks are very good and you get also something to eat.   i have had the sate. recommendable.  no restaurant for a grande dinner.  but quite ok.   staff is very friendly.
"ok, been there multiple times now and i think it might be time to talk about this o "

this was better in its old style. it had character and had staff with good attitude. not so much now.
we had a late night meal here on our last night in the netherlands. the food was good pub style fare. the service was the best we had on the trip to nl. they had some good local beers on tap which is something i look forward to when i travel.
"had dinner here on a friday night. its typical dutch pub food: gambas, salmon filet, sate, fries, e.g. nothing fancy but a good pub dinner."
"stopped here for a quick dinner. great beer selection, i love brugse zot and have not seen it outside bruges before, highly recommende "
the service and ambiance are still great. beer selection wasnt as good this time around. food was definitely not as good. i had the parma and melon which was ok except that the melon was honeydew instead of cantaloupe. i then had the pork tenderloin in pepper sauce which i didnt like much at all. hmmm. i am struggling to find motivation to come back here...
"have surprised these guys with reservations for 12-14 people at last minutes notice, and its never been a problem. food is good, service friendly. comparable to english pub food, bit higher quality,  and more choice."
"nice friendly eating cafe in rijswijk, also friendly for a drink in the evening. nice atmosphere and friendly."
this is a very local watering hole. has been there for over 30 years and a good place to have a drink and bitterballen. its nice enough but what is a shame is that to get inside you have to go through the front conservatory seating bit where there is a big cloud of cigarette smoke.
lady who was taking order by mcdrive was very rude. it happened 1 september around 17.10. this is the reason that we are not going to visit this place anymore.
bram ladage is a typical dutch snack bar located in the bogaard shopping centre in rijswijk. the french fries were ok but not as stunning as their self created reputation would support. at 3 euros (with sauce) the smallest sized helping was not cheap in my view. they do have a nice shared seating area in the sun in front of them. 
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because it’s close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, i’ve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but i’d rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so i’d like them better"
"we were a company of several people who had different dishes. the meat or fish was good, but the side dishes were boring. as everywhere else in the netherlands they only serve french fries and creamy sauces. very good service and friendly staff!"
"doppio espresso is situated in the covered shopping center koningshoek in maassluis. this shopping center has the advantage of all weather shopping and lots and lots of free parking. doppio espresso has an inviting appearance with tables inside and outside in the wide passage. not unexpected through the name of the establishment italian food and drinks are offered and efforts are made to create an italian atmosphere. i settled for a common black coffee, because i didnt want to experience the disappointment of an inadequate espresso and it was too late for a cappuccino. cannoli were on offer and i couldnt resist ordering one. the cannolo was better than expected, but the envelope was a bit hard. generally a good effort was made by the staff to create an italian atmosphere, but unfortunately the eye watering prices were very un- italian. a three point rating."
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"
we went with the family to this restaurant in some very old buildings for mothers d 
"theres little to redeem this place. set on the side of a shopping centre and over-looking the brutalist building of the local city hall, the food was equally uninspiring. its trying to lean up-market but should really stick to capturing the shoppers for coffee & cake or a lunch-time sandwich."
"this restaurant, situated in the heart of charming, water-rich maassluis, operates under a french name, monsieur paul. however, they offer a typical english dish, high tea. this high tea consists of tea in several flavours, sandwiches and as piece de resistance, an etagere with a variety of sweet food, pastries, scones, chocolates, you immediately associate with england. so far so good. the tea tasted good and the food was of good quality. however, i will never get used to the ambiance and service in dutch restaurants. the tables were so small that there was barely room for the etagere, teapot and two cups. furthermore, the tables were so close together that i had to be careful not to swipe my neighbours teacup from his table. and the service of the staff. the dutch are not so good in making customers welcome, compared to staff in other countries. oh, the waitresses were friendly, but serving customers is a profession, even an art and, what i remarked, the dutch havent mastered this yet."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than € 6,00 per bottle….!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!
"food not cooked well, ingredients mentioned on the.menu not found! dirty cutlery, unfriendly service. gone before dessert was served to never coming back!"
"we picked this restaurant for a family dinner, based on previous experiences by some of our group who had eaten here as a coup "
"the food was good, the prices are decent, the staff can not handle the number of guests. you really ger a slow service."
this restaurant is in the middle of the centre located at the nice harbour but unfortunately you cannot view that out of the restaurant. the food is ok as is the atmosphere; if you make a reservation ask for a table downstairs as the few tables upstairs make you feel a bit lonley.

"we visited this place last summer where we had an all-round great experience and were looking forward to enjoying our dinner once again in this brasserie conveniently located opposite a playground for children. the atmosphere has very much changed and the standards of service somehow have fallen since last summer: we found the staff who took our orders particularly unfriendly and rude. given our unpleasant experience ordering drinks, we walked away to another place for dinner. the menu card looked different too from last year: not the surprisingly diverse choice out of traditional dutch and frisian recipes seen last year at the same place. fins gourmets, passez votre chemin...."

"after a walk, we sat down in this restaurant for a drink. the waiters were very young and inexperienced but tried very hard. the drinks were poor (wine, beer). the snacks were ok. the restaurant has a nice setting and decor but was packed with families, so having a relaxing drink was out of the question.."
"personnel is rude and very unwelcoming. i went cycling and forgot water at home so stopped here for a snack and to drink some water. the waiter was not very helpful and basically told me to find myself a table outside (it was completely empty inside, but apparently not possible to find a spot for one person) i sat outside, a very rude young female waitress came and took my order refusing to speak english even when it was clear that i could not speak dutch. i finally got my cache and the water. i paid wuivkly because i did not want to be there much longer and she grabbed my half full glass of water that i wanted to drink yo make space for next customers. i had to grab my glass and tell her i was not finished. she left the glass and proceeded to seat a family of 4 people at my table while i was still sitting and finishing my water. i usually don’t complain about service in restaurant but this was just a bit too much! really unacceptable behavior. don’t go there unless you are dutch and very blond."
"26th dec, lunch with 11 persons. the food was not good. i would not recommend eating here. food was so bad i did not even bother to take any pictures. very dissatisfied with the food. the staff however was very friendly. the service of a tuktuk’ was the best experience. "

"this is a wonderful place to take a break from a bike ride. the restaurant has an outdoor terrace with service adjacent to the main building. in the back, across a narrow lane and right on the water is a simple dock over the river angstel, with seating and self service - you place your order at a window and are called when it is ready for pick-up. no frills, but the views over the meadows cant be beat."
horrible experience. today march 15. no entrance. no hostess for reception. no drie gangen menu. horrible bad food. crap ambiance. i used to go to school there. the waitress had long hair and not up. she didn’t speak dutch. ukrainian. the food was the worst i have ever seen. never again. construction everywhere. no one knew where the chef was. he wasn’t there. the website looks fab. the experi nfe and the food was scam. the only good thing was the bandol rose. wine list is great. don’t go there
"claim to be vegetarian friendly, but do only have meat main courses on the menu. old-fashioned, unnecessary, not customer friendly."
"this is a restaurant of 12 in a dozen. nice if you are in the neighborhood but not really worth the travel. we had a very niece evening but that ws primarily because of our the audience. the menu is very conservative, the selection of wines not very exciting. food was ok prepared but my steak was well done while i ordered medium. it is these little things that make it average. the price is very reasonable. so we had a good night but the restaurant was nothing special."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.

"in a warm evening we had a dinner there with friends. kind staff, starters and food satisfying, but could not be considered excellent."
this is what the most people like: cosy and not too high standards for delicacy. we only had a starter: looked pretty but without feeling for good cooking.
"we came in for a quick dinner after a long trip. only after we had finished our drinks we became aware of the fact the kitchen opnend after 6 pm, although we directly ordered it wasnt mentioned to us. the quality of the food was poor, small rations and lousy french fries. however after travelling through belgium is was a pleasure to be served by adequate staff."
i visited this establishment with a business friend and it started out perfectly nice on the terrace next to the canal. sun was shining a good beer and glass of wine. we were helped by a young man who just started so wasn’t up to speed yet but charming and helpful. one other waitress was also pleasant enough. but one waitress had an attitude and that is just not acceptable in the hospitality indust 
"the restaurant has a sitting area on the vecht where u can have a drink or eat. as starter i had the tuna which was quite disappointing in terms of taste, presentation and size. it was very tiny pieces of tuna in a lot of broth. we enjoyed the main course more. the beef was tender and tasty. the fish was an average pan fried one...the service was good."
"this is a great example of a wanna be. great terrace on the river vecht but thats about it. meat was dry, gnocchi were anything but that and when i asked about it i was informed that the square, deep fried things on the plate were indeed gnocchi. worst meal i have had in a long time! "

"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."
"i took my daughter, her husband and their two children, ages 8 and 6, to dekooi on saturday, april 22 before i returned to the u. "
"de koooi is beautifully situated, new and modern in an old looking building. perfect fit with the surroundings. quality of the presented menu is average, prices are well above the restaurants in the village/centre of spakenburg. either boost the quality or lowering prices should be done. at this moment the scenery is nice, but lunch/dinne"
"great food if you can spare the time. service is poor, waiting times are much too long. i could say that the food is wordt waiting, but it isn’t we scrapped the restaurant of our list. it’s a restaurant voor a quick dinner, not for a evening filling programm."
"the atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy, however the food is very very poor. we ordered salmon and it was all covered by a sauce that killed the taste of the fish. at the bottom of the salmon there was some pasta overcooked and insipid (lack of salt in the water when cooked "
"i made a reservation on line which was accepted and when we arrived , they refused us !! the restaurant closed 2 ours later (we ate in an other just in front "
i was here for dinner with my family last we 
"fine food and good service. the menu is ok and let you choose between meat, fish en salads. the menu is simple but adequate"
"the location is absolutely nice:close to the harbour of spakenburg. when you can sit on the terrace this place is really nice. however, the food and price are not more than average."
"we had lunch here in september and the service was terrible. we ordered two toasties and had to wait over thirty minutes. i had ordered a tuna melt and was very unhappy that it contained chilli, i struggle with chilli and it was not mentioned on the menu! would not return."
"in the netherlands this type of eating is normal. you can order almost anything that you can fry. like the kroket and frikadel... this establishment offers plates too and its not bad. so if you are in for a snackbar, this one is a good one"
"we had lunch on the terrace near the water, which was good. the staff was friendly and the service was fast. and of course we were excited to eat out again after lockdo "
"we had to wait so long for our food, it ruined the evening. waiting staff tried hard but obviously the kitchen/management could not cope. what a disappointment."
we arrived hungry and had to wait 15 minutes to get any attention in a restaurant with only 3 tables ful 
"we just had a quite drink here before visiting the castle. the place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. the staff is friendly but it is an understatement to say that the so-called espresso is really underwhelming. if you want a decent coffee, better to have it in the castle itself."
"right in front of the castle cannenburch in vaassen the location of this restaurant is amazing! the food is good, the staff is young and seems inexperienced."
"we were just at the bierbrouwerij on saturday. it was a beautiful, warm day and the place is very nice. we had a large group-- it was a family reunion with about 35 people ages 8 to 8 "
"the place is great, the food is not (anymore). has there been a chefs change? we ordered chicken risotto and the vegetarian wellington. the risotto was undercooked and not fresh (warmed in microwave?). the vegetarian wellington was a lot of puff pastry with almost no filling. you literally had to search for it. i would seriously advise the owner to search for a new chef, as todays food scares of people."
"we had lunch at this restaurant, its kind of a fast food restaurant with its speciality, chicken, since 1957. we just got french fries and drink. by nice weather you can sit outside, there is a lot of space."
when you walk in the restaurant you get a nice atmosphere and get your own seati 
"in uk, we used to wait to be seated, here you walk and get served. at first the dutch lady who served me did not speak much english, and could not tell me the special, then tried to sell me something off the menu then got another waiter who was really good, gave me the run down, starters, soups, then mains half a chicken etc.plus help your self salary, not much to say. if you like harvester salary, then your be very disappointed he "
never go there please. they don’t know the word service! rude personnel as well. they were unable to exchange €2.00.
"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"restaurant smulwereld de poshoorn has evolved from a fast food restaurant to an establishment with a wider scope, by offering also a menu with chinese dishes. as de posthoorn is run for the last couple of years by a family from the far east, this is not surprising. ordering is at the counter; the food is brought to you at your table. the service is polite and genuine hospitable, the fries are prepared with fresh cooking oil and the prices are moderate. furthermore, outside seating is provided, so you can watch the life in voorhuizen go by while eating your burger or babi panggang. not a restaurant on the must do list, but a safe bet for a quick and inexpensive meal when in the neighborhood."
"smulwereld de posthoorn is good for a quick stop on the way the replenish your stomach. de posthoorn has many advantages over the big fast food chains: it is situated in the center of voorthuizen at the road parallel to the main road through voorthuizen with no parking restrictions, the restaurant has the traditional counter with the deep fryers for take-away, but there is a cosy corner with 4 tables with sit-down service. the food is of course the dutch kaleidoscope of deep fried food products, but the french fries with sauce, salad and kroket, frikandel, satay and more are served on real plates with real cutlery. far better than the big chains. the restaurant is quiet, no blaring music and when the weather is clement, there are outside tables to seat at, even improving the experience, eating and watching the traffic go by. unfortunately, voorthuizen is in the middle of the veluwe, popular with tourist on bicycle tours, so the outside tables tend to be snapped up quickly. no culinary feats are accomplished at de posthoorn, but it is ok within their limitations."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "
after visiting radio kootwijk we stopped at this cafetaria for something cool. the location is in the shopping centre of voorthuizen. its very nice sitting outside on the bench with a cup of ice in your hand
"the restaurant kwalitaria de daltons is a fast food restaurant in the center of voorthuizen. the restaurant is, together with a row of shops, situated along a medium sized parking lot. dont forget to put out the parking disc; parking is time controlled here. it was glorious weather, so we settled down on the outside terrace for a quick lunch. this terrace is a bit dingy and cramped, but it serves the purpose. service on the terrace is offered, but was spotty and aloof, so we ended up ordering the food and drink at the counter and we took the serving tray with our order to our table ourselves. the food, french fries with a vegetarian snack, was mediocre, even taken into account the reduced expectations you have of a fast food restaurant. prices were at the upper side of the expectations. kwalitaria de daltons will not be our first choice in the future when stopping in voorthuizen."
it took the waiter a long time to arrive at our table to take our ord 
"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
stopped here for a snack after visiting muiderslot castle. not the warmest of welcomes. food was ok. not much else to say.
by far the worst mcdonalds ive ever been to. cold food. low working pace. rude employees. dont go!
friendly staff and they fixed the issue by taking it off the bill without having to ask for it. the chips were also fantastic and my wife enjoyed her pea so 
"from the first moment our waiter was all but welcoming. after some low quality fried typical dutch appetizers, the 6 of us had to wait 55 minutes for our main course. when prompted why it was taking so long for the fish & chips the waiter replied: thats because you ordered the appetizers! (?!?). when finally the food came the chips were hardly warm, no crispy and the crust around the cod was overcooked, really hard to crush. we were mildly vocal about the all thing and the same waiter not even apologetic... despite the order came out even wrong as one of us had requested chicke "
"we got to sit at 13:30, and the main dishes at 3:20. we were told that we had to wait so much since we took starters, and it was our fault."
"this pub should have everything going for it. location, atmosphere etc but the service was truly dreadful. there were 11 customers inside and another 8 on the terrace. my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and a red wine. simple enough you might think. ten minutes later we still had not been served despite the fact there were 4 employees wandering about. we gave up and went across the road to ome kos where we got immediate service."
"stopped to get some drinks and snacks, regretfully no table available in the shade. we waited quite long without getting any service, heating up more and more. luckily a table freed at the neighbors, so we left and got instant service."
"on a sunny evening, visit this restaurant with a terrace directly next to the canal. as you see the boats pass by, enjoy your dinner at the waterfront. when its the season order mussels. youll get a big pan full of mussels. service is bit slow."
"i was so disappointed when i came here with my wife and a couple of friends as a stop on our cycle around het gooi. we each ordered a beer and a tapas plateau to share (for €13.50) from the borrelkart (drinking snacks menu) expecting that it would be an adequate snack for the 4 of us, however the plateau came out with a few paltry slices of meat and a thin crust of bread. when we questioned the quantity we were told that the plateau was a starter for 1 person (despite it being on the drinking snack menu) and that we could not return it in lieu of another item. we were incredibly disappointed by both the food we ordered and by the service we received during our visit, and as such we would not recommend this bar when there are so many pleasant venues within such a small town."
"called here for a late lunch after visiting the castle. the terrace is directly next to the canal, with a view over the bridge and all the boats going though the locks. menu was fine, if limited. the quality of the food we had, was good and the staff very helpful. well worth trying here, if only for the position in the town."
"my, my boyfriend any my best friend went to amsterdam for a short trip. we cycled to muiderslot castle (15km one way) and have a walk around the castle and the garden. before we decided to cycled back, we wanted to have a lunch and decided for this place which was the worst idea ever. we sat inside as it was very warm outside and wanted to cool down a little b "
"the restaurant had a great atmosphere it was a typical old dutch cafe and the decoration added a nice touch. it also has a nice location near the river. when we sat down, we had to wait quite a while for someone to come take our order and after that even longer until the food was served. the people were not particularly friendly either. the food, when it came, was very nice but that did not completely make up for the poor service."
right next to uncle ko situated. just a fisherman eatery. do not expect haute cuisine. but certainly in the herft or in early spring a great place to sail to eat after a day.
"we waited 20 minutes for a table outside because they wouldnt let us sit inside which was completely empty. when a table came free outside, the waiter slapped a reserved sign down. we cycled on to naarden which was much prettier and had more choices of cafes with friendlier people. "
"the food is nice, but as the place was crowded, it took a long time to be served. some of the dishes from the menu were sold out (i wanted to order cod but there was none left). very noise and popular, busy and conviviaal though."
"this place has been here forever and ive been coming here for over 30 years. menu is still the same, food is decent, but service seems to be deterioratin "
a very nice spot in a little town. its a cosy place for a lunch or dinner. i come here now and then for over many years and it didnt change that much. its still good and they have nice food. try the sat 
"when you go to a restaurant its not just the food, its quality, service and atmosphere. we got none of this today. unbeliavebly horrible pasta, vongole and one plain for a kid. cheap patè. all dishes, pretending to be french cousine, are arranged well in advance and poorly heated on the spot before serving. only 6 more guests present for lunch and the service was disorganized and slow. the plateau royal was hilarious, stale oysters, sparse grilled(?) shrimps and a raw half lobster."
"we wanted to eat at a french restaurant in muiden for bastille day. we spotted dedeolen right near the locks with an eclectic interior. the menu was difficult to discern the difference between starters or main dishes, without much help from our waiter who probably was the owner. there was also a 3 or 4 course fixed price meal, which referred to a separate menu, which was never provided. one of us ordered a salad nicoise, which arrived with no potatoes, anchovies or olives, basically overcooked tuna on salad with canned mushrooms. when we inquired about the lack of the standard ingredients, the waiter said thats the way we serve it here. the unpleasantness continued to the end when we got the bill. it included the price of a large portion of a plate, when we clearly ordered ordered a small portion, and a plate that we clearly did not order. on complaining, the waiter questioned our dispute and didnt believe he had included a non ordered plate. when we counted the number of dishes he reluctantly adjusted the bil "
a small restaurant with a great atmosphere. food was small and was still hubgty after the visit. waiters were not focussed and soft drinks were hot.
"i understand that everybody has to cope with staff shortages. but what happened last night was not oke. i know it’s not the serving staff’s fault. but we left straight after our main course, because by the time we had finished that, it was too dark for a desert, let alone a cup of coffee. we sat down at the table at 19.20, finished main course at 22. "
"this is a place of two halves, inside they think rugs work as table cloths but outside it’s a river side bar with modern tapas style men "
"we came as a family , the service was really not nice at all , they asked us to change the table twice without any clear reason , we asked for reasons and we said that it is just a cup of coffee . the woman who is in charge is not nic "
"location is perfect: 5 mins walk from the castle and right on the canal. your typical dutch cafe, nice and easy. sandwiches are nice, regular dutch prices, which are generally speaking quite high for the food they offer. staff is nice but service is slow."
"ive been living in the netherlands for over 4 years and im used to the low level of service and courtesy of restaurant/bar staff here, but the staff at cafe ome ko is really raising the bar in terms of rudeness. the waiter first didnt let me parking my bike in a space which doesnt belong to the cafe at all (i checked with local authorities) and asked us rudely to remove them. we did and when we came back he already gave the table to another person, claiming we went away for parking bikes, so the next in line takes the table. even if the other customer, more courteous, understood the situation and gave us back our table, we decided to leave immediately since the very uncomfortable situation and the explicit hostility of the waiter. we move to the brasserie just 20 meters away and get a very good service. never again."
"i have mixed feelings about writing this review. i wavered between 3 and 4 but had to settle on 3 in hopes that maybe the owners would see this and make some changes. we stopped in for lunch after visiting muiderslot. it was a beautiful day so we sat outside near the canal. the water locks are there as well as a rotating bridge to let the boats thru the canal. it was enjoyable watching the activity going on there and helped pass the time while we waited and waited for service. the wait staff was nice and friendly but just very slow, which may not have been all their fault, and not as attentive as we had hoped. when we sat, there were not that many other customers there. after we ordered, many new people came who seemed to get food before we did. we only ordered soup and a fried egg platter so we didnt think it would take that long. luckily we were not in a hurry. my friend had eggs with bacon and cheese and enjoyed her meal. i had french onion soup, but i forgot it is not made differently here in this country. it had a very bland white broth which really needed lots of salt to make it edible. we also asked for water multiple times and it wasnt until the check was asked for that the final reminder got us some water...well, one of us that is. would i come back? not sure. i would probably try another cafe before giving this one a second chance. again, staff seemed nice, just needed to give the patrons a little more attention. there seemed to be enough working, so i dont think they were short handed."
"my husband and i stopped by for a quick beer and snacks. well, it ended up to be a long wait, no service and a bitter experience. we found an empty table in the crowded outside seating, and there were used cups and plates on the table. while we were waiting patiently, more people came after us and sat behind, next and the front of our table. though their tables were cleaned and the customers drinks were served, the waiters didnt even come to clean the table nor looked at us so we can ask them to clean the table and get a menu. after waiting there at the dirty table for 15 minutes or so, we left. we obviously didnt look dutch and felt that we were treated this way because of our racial background (asian and latino). my husband and i traveled around the world and had a meal from a small kiosk to a 5 start restaurant. this was the first time when i was treated indifferently and in a disrespectful manner. avoid here if you want to be treated respectfully. "
"our dutch host thought this would be a great place to take us to eat after visiting muidenslot. everyone who comes to the netherlands needs to try sate. unfortunately, it was the worst chicken sate (or was it really dog meat?) i have ever tasted. our host was embarrassed because we confessed that we couldnt eat it. it was that bad. they were embarrassed that we couldnt eat it, but confessed they hadnt eaten there for 20 years and hadnt realised the standards have dropped quite significantly. we paid something like 20 euros each for the most appalling looking chicken brochette. the meat was unpallatable. aside from that, the fries had clearly come straight from a packet, the salad and sate sauce all came in tubs that had the plastic taken off. this was fast food of the nastiest, cheapest kind. we left our meat, and told the waiter we cant eat it, its cheap meat, and you can taste it, to which he replied : well everyone else liked it. really, we should have left without paying. if you want good sate, go to cafe 10 @ tuin in amsterdam."

"food was okay, location is good, service is very bad. first you are not allowed on terrace to have only a few drink, one have to eat here. after ordering some lunch and just after food arrived a larger group came to sit next to us but had too few space, couple of times they were told out loud by the waiter that our table was free very shortly so they could all sit normally. we were just eating our lunch and took our time of course. but when i paid the bill i was not even given time to stuck away my wallet, the table was cleaned while i was still sitting there getting my stuff together so rude it was. "
stopped in here for drinks while passing through town with a large group of three to four tables on the pat 
"we ordered two coffee for me and my wife and 1 smoozy for our kid, but all other people around us (that also came later) got their orders (same coffee and smoozy as well), we asked waiter a few times to bring the order faster as we really need to go soon. without real help, he just said that theyre busy. after waiting of 30 minutes (!!!! yes - half an hour for drinks) i came inside caffee to asked whether its ready or we can just cancel it as we dont have time anymore, but bartender jumped out of the bar and started scream on me like in front of my friend, another waiter and people: yes, were busy! in what country its not normal for you to wait such time for drinks?! dont talk to me like this! take your coffee, pay money and get out of here as soon as possible!. if he would not be so small and fancy guy a few times less than me im sure he would start a fight, but after he came too close to me he realized that he overestimated himsel "
"not so good food is below expectation, simpel , far from being named as restaurant  service was poor, i get it, it was busy day"
"terrible service, the food was not bad, but the service is the worst i have ever had.  it is a pity that the place has a very good location."
"ordered from the lunch card sardines, flammekuche bacon and one with salmon and a hamburger. the sardines were big and really nice. the flammekuche were really small and not enough for a lunch. the burger was ok. coffee was good. all in all it was a little pricey for what we order "
"at the spot where earlier an italian restaurant was located is now a dutch brasserie with nice weather find (not easy, because is populair)  a table near  the waterfront. great fun to watch sailors struggle. the food is considering the attractive price a deal good."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
the waiter had no manners at a 
"the meal was good but its too expensive for what it was. so simple yet so expansive. moroever, the water costs 6 euros ?!! what kind of water is that to be this pricey..."
"the food is very good. i wish they had more options.  the price is not a fair price. they dont take your order you have to walk to them once you want to order food.  friendly people, i just wish there was value for money."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   i’d have coffee again but i’d leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
this is just a very low key dining experience but the food was well prepared.  it overlooks the river which adds to the experience.
good location but lacking in food performence. the dutch like their fries and know how to cook them. but here served lukewarm&soggy. the fish was deep fried and the sate not well grilled. this can be done a lot better even in the dutch kitchen m. but again the location is nice and next time i will go for the cafetaria and take the white bun with kroket with mustard and enjoy it outside on one of the bench 
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20€ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. i’m not sure i’d bother going again. 
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 €. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
"you can have a great party i guess, but it is an old brown bar, that is in need of some tlc. you can play biljart and you can sit down at a slotsmachine, and you can have some coffey and pie if you are visiting schoonhoven."
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.

"while the food was pub level, that wasnt the main issu "
"we coming for try and drink something , the waitress don’t speak english and she was so lazy, she  forgot to bring one beer whit only 4 table in all the restaurant , the spicy burger was not spicy"
worst place ever ordered food in advance for later two hours befor 
no star. but star prices. amuses. 15 per glas. very young personnel. so where is the change. basically the same as in the past but higher prices.
"the expectations to this place was bigger than the experience. the food and wine was okay, apart from a wines that did not match the sweetness of the desert. the staff tried their best, but there were too few waiters on too many tables. this dragged the whole experience down, as we had to wait very long between each serving. price was ok."
"it wasnt really spectacular. perhaps we xpected too much but sometimes the experiments in the nouvelle cuisine are overdone. the taste is still the most important. a very big wine card and i must admit the sommelier gave us good advise. we dont want the wine included menu and so his advise was necessary. the personnel is very friendly as well, but the result wasnt as expected"
"whilst i cannot deny that the food at la trinite is fantastic, unacceptable service and unprofessional staff means that this restaurant does not warrant michelin star stat "
"before they moved to their current location, we went multiple times and had always had a good time. we were a party of four, and decided last minute to go have dinner at their new location. we were quite early, compared to other parties. we had an aperitif and received some appetizers that, we thought, gave a good first impression. we chose the menu, and were extremely disappointed by the portions. first of all they were very small and it took a long time before the dishes followed. we were set first at table and ended with the last table set. we had to wait a long time, we had to eat a lot of bread to feel satisfied, not ok! also the main course, pigeon, was served with almost no vegetables, too bad. we had ordered an extra dish, the beemster xo (10€ extra) and hoped for an original preparation of it. instead we received 5 pieces of cheese with some mustard (again disappointed, for a 1 star michelin you have other expectations "
"i came here with my family, there were 8 of us in the party so at first we thought this place was a great find as it seemed spacious and modern. unfortunately the service was rude and very inattentive. the food was ok but nothing specia "
"we called in here before dinner for two glasses of cava, which seemed reasonable value at €6. we visited again on another occasion and had two glasses of the house red. this was a big mistake as it was probably the worst red wine we had ever had in our lives, it was undrinkable. we will definitely avoid the house wine in future."
not much else to say really. this is located in a busy area of a busy town so is good for a coffee or beer sitting at the tables outside and watching the world go by. free wifi too if you ask for the code.
we eat at the outside terrace. good location close to a square and in one of the main shopping streets. we were note very much impressed with the moules- frites we eat there. when serving the food the flies came along. big portions but not tastefull at all. overpriced at 27.5 euro a pers

"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garçon served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.
"where should i start : slow and rude service, wrong orders, uncooked and cold food which is ridiculously overprice "

"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 € had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50€ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40€."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!

we just ate a pancake/waffle on their quite nice terrace (full of noisy kids but i didnt mind that da 
"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
when we visit sluis we love to stop there for a crepe. good and fast service. they show beautiful plates with exotic fruits but the fruit is not always good ... too bad they do not have a terrace . which we prefer in the summer.. 
nice place with air conditionning but some areas should definitely be cleaned.   ice cream but no lactose-free once.

my family and i stopped here a couple of days ago for waffles.the waffles were good but nothing special. the waffles were 12 euros with fresh fruit and ice cream. the young male server that waited on us was rude and expressed his frustration with our inability to understand the menu which was in dutch and german.
i wanted a waffle with strawberries and my wife a small fruit salad. they brought a whole contraption of fruits... nothing special other than the presentation and they charged 12 euros a plate. on the menu wasnt even liste 
me and my family orderd a simple dish. we waited in total of a 90 minutes on our food. the food was good but service is terrible. also a (tip for the owner) hire more waiters from dutch origin. many couldnt understand us beaucause they didnt speak the local language.
terrible service sat there about 50 minutes after asking for a radler beer had to point to the drink i wanted on the menu as the person serving could not understand dutch or english waited and waited but no drink left after 50 minutes never again need more staff and ones who understand dutch or english
we went in for a quick lunch on what was possibly one of the busiest days of the year. it took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to serve my first bite! they didnt even put bread on the table to nibble on! food was so-so. nothing special. the waiters were very nice and doing what they could. i think the problem is in the bar and kitch 
"although the speed of service was not the best , the setting and decor was good and the outside terrace was excellent for a summer day.very child friendly. our meals were seafood (mosselen&sole) and were very tasty."
"we tried paling and mosselen. very good mussels, eel was a bit less: too soft. its a pity they dont contract an extra waiter, specially during nice summer days when terrace is full of waiting people..."
"this is a nicely located reataurant with a large dining area in the garden at the rear which we used and it was very pleasant. however, service was very slow even though the place wasnt very busy. my starter of prawns and mushrooms in garlic was excellent but we had problems with our steak mains. my wife will not eat meat which is even faintly pink so we asked for it to be medium to well done. when it arrived it was raw in the middle and dripping with blood so it was sent back. when it reappeared there was very little difference so, rather than labour the point, she just left it. im not a fussy as my wife but my own steak was too bloody for my liking, even after it, too, was sent back. we were then treated to a lecture by the rather condescending waiter on how steak should be cooked and what you should ask f "
sluis a place with a lot of tourists also in all the restaurants and cafes.the frietstal is known for many years in sluis for the friendly hospitallity and good food
the comments on trip advisor for this restaurant are mixed and that is what we found . we found the mix of quality for the food ranged between slop and average and based on our experience we would not go back
"during our trip to bruges, we stayed in a hotel in sluis, and decided to have our last evening meal in sluis itself, so we could walk back to the hot "
"we called today for lunch, a family of 7. the drinks were ordered quickly an efficiently, then the food order was taken. the food was duly served, but we didnt recognise some of the order, but we were rudely told that it was what we had ordered. then another waiter brought our order. turned out that the first had been delivered to the wrong able. this of course was our fault, with the lady behind the counter being so rude towards us through the waiters. we will definitely never be returning to this place."
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"late afternoon 4 pm ish, called for our early evening meal. it was empty which should have rang alarm bells but we just put it down to the hour. service was indifferent. slow to arrive with the drinks despite there being no one else there. ordered 2 x half chickens and ribs + chips. of the 2 chickens, 1 was ok but the other was still breathing, no well not quite, but when i cut into it it was still bleeding. i immediately told the waitress who wasnt in the least bit apologetic, simply took it away. now any descent restaurant would have started again with fresh produce. not this one. when i got my plate back, it was the same chicken. this time i think nuked whereas at first it was obviously deep fried due to the amount of oil it was sitting in. the ribs were very dry and quite tasteless. only saving grace was the chips which were good. would i go again. no chance."
"with our family from germany (4 persons) we visited sluis and wanted to have a light lunch in de corner: 1 soup, 1 saled and a shared portion of musse "
"we visited zeeuws vlaanderen for a weekend. were dutch and the zeeland province is our birthground. sluis is a transformed little city with no charm at all. its a an allover moneymaking area and this restaurant was an important part of pur dissappointment. we had an 2-scope icecream with a kind of spraycream and an espressocoffee for around 15 euro! the espresso was good... the icecream was not. in sluis you can get a parkingplace...youd have tompay the fee for an entire day ... even if you want to visit the supermarket. for us no problem, we domnot need to stay there, but imagening people being on holiday with the family... they dont say no , they wont spoil the day! they should say no.. because theyre ripped off and seated on that terrace i felt ashame to be a dutch national"
"we ordered the pancakes with tea for €4,50. unfortunately the pancakes are small and nothing special. one of them didnt seem to be baked properly either. wouldnt come back for dessert."
"a sign outside promoted paling in het groen for €23,5. inside the menu stated €24,5 "
we ordered a normal round of drinks at this restaurant and then asked for glasses of water as well at the same time. when four bottles of water arrived with our other drinks and we said we had wanted tap water we were then told we dont do tap water. this hadnt been told to us when we ordered. we then proceeded to wait 45min for toasted sandwiches one of which was burnt. an unfortunate experience. 
"last week-end we (2) went to this place for the second time. sunny day, lots of people outside, and inside. we were here already once and had a salade niçoise which was really ok. we even recommended the place a couple of months ago to friends who did complain about the poor quality. we were surprised. but last sunday (07/04/2013) we understood hem. although the place is clean, we had poor food quality (i had asian spareribs where 1/3 were barely grilled and still pink inside.) my partners white wine had a cork taste and the waitress told us this was impossible because it came from a carton container ( we have a serious wine experience and know when there is a cork smell/taste). she was quite blunt. the scampi from my partner were small and without taste, too much cream that was too liquid. my rosé wine was ok (at last). we decided to pay the bill and go. when going to the mens toilet i had the very awful experience to discover the toilet left full of excrements on the seat (yes i am not joking). i understand that its not he owners fault but when i did reported this to the waitress, i had a very grumpy answer instead of something like oh were sorry sir, well check this immediately and thank you for reporting it. never again!"
we went there based on the positive previous reviews but left disappointed. the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly but the food was just not good enough. the fish stew was overcooked and the pasta was dripping in oil.
"poor experience… fish far too cooked, cesar salad with big chunk of chicken impossible to chew because they were too cooked as well. never again…"
spare ribs were ok but not perfect. service was polite. people from inside came on terrace to smoke  despite our 2 small kids and the food.
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said “5 more minutes” which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked good…"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant 🍴 is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish 🐟 soup 🍲, but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries 🍟 are ok 👌, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesn’t really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesn’t has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"
"the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. we got a free amuse. our soup was also a good starter. however, our meat brochette was a bit of a let down. the meat was just tough. maybe we just had bad luck, looking at all the very positive reviews. still had a nice evening!"
"we ended up indoors on a beautiful day as the wasps were everywhere!! this was a shame as it’s location is beautiful on the side of the river. one did still manage to find us indoors, but this was better than the dozens crawling in our drinks and over the tables outsi "
"i had a grill burger: the bread was as twice as big as the patty, nothing special (only some ketchup and one leaf of lettuce.. and thats it "
i was visiting the area of sluis and decided to have a small snack at the mill of the villa 
"we went here many times before but now they have started a new process for ordering and it is no longer very nice. you now need to take your table number and order at one of the two kiosks entering in your mobile so you can receive a sms when your drinks are ready. i appreciate the use of technology but for a nice restaurant, i wish they would have kept it traditiona "
"this restaurant looks nice from the outside (it’s an old windmill) and the interior is cozy, especially the part in the historical building. we were sitting for less than a minute when the waitress came to take our order (good points for speed you should think), because we even hadn’t even had the time to open the menu. we may as well not have done that, because we had to wait for a long time for her to come back. when we finally could place our order, she indicated we can only have drinks in this part of the building, and had to move to the other side of the restaurant. when we did, we again waited for half an hour to place our order. the waiter was impolite and inattentive, the food and hot drinks were so-so and over-priced. you can find cheaper and better in sluis, the historical building is not a wild card to charge high prices for bad food and slow and impolite service, plus rigid rules about where what could be consumed."
"the place is pleasant, but the food is so so. the service is not so bad. it is only an option, if you meet the place and do not like to go far."
"its interesting to see the windmill, we went inside the shop next to the restaurant.  we made a decision to go to the restaurant because of the location, quite unique, modern interior in an old windmill"
"we went to this restaurant yesterday as it had shade and we were all boiling. big mistake ! the service was unfriendly , the food was small, burnt and tasteless and over priced . shocking !"
this restaurant in typical style is situated on the marketsquare of sluis opposite the belltower ( with tourist office : vv 
terrible service . arrogant behavior of the management. the french fries were under any standard. the mussels were not hot enough... the whole atmosphere was old fashioned . a real deceiving experience. no value at all for mon 
nice cozy place to have some food. local fish or mussels are of course mandatory when eating at the coast.
"in this friendly little tourist town,we came accross this cosy restaurant amongst the well preserved historic surrounding buildings.very friendly service without being pushy.we ate seafood-mussels and a mixed seafood dish,that were well prepared and tasty.a lovely house wine and a reasonable bill.what more can you ask for?"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"the restaurant is alright but it was def not meant for people who unable to speak dutch. i understand not having an english menu, but the wait staff who seemed competent enough were not willing to help out some foreigners understanding the menu, or speaking english after we ordered and made it clear that was all we could do. shame cause we probs would have ordered more food and drink! at least we def would have tipped more for the effort. "
"visiting sluis, a lively little town, we arrived midday and it drizzled. we found a parking spot immediately opposite this restaurant and chose an outdoor table on the covered terrace. the service was quick and correct, but their heart wasnt in  "
the manager is incredibly rude and the food just wasn’t that good. this country is filled with so many lovely people and you don’t need to go out of your way to be treated badly. eat elsewhere.
"the place is located somewhere in a nice middle of nowhere, in zeeland, close to the belgian border. without a gps you will never find i "
"when we made the reservation we relied on the 4 to 5 dots on tripadvisor, sounds like a safe bet. however, 4 to 5 dots are in my opinion overrated. i always try to look at positive elements but this could really be better. the positive side: waiters and waitresses work hard and really do their best. but they should have more people around as they were understaffed in my opinion. the menu could use more fantasy. putting butter in plastic cups on the table is something you would expect in a cantina or restaurant along the road - this is not a good idea. the crevette salad could have more attention: it felt like a very quick fix. i also do not understand that you put 75 eurocent on the menu for mayonaise. i expect that to be included. taste of the courses we ordered: we have seen better. also taking into account pricing is not quite on the cheap side (that is an understatement). i encourage the restaurant to put more effort in menu and courses for such prices."
"now the restaurant is called “le petit paris”, worst experience ever. the fish was overcooked and the chicken from cesar salad was unchewable :-("
this restaurant came recommended to us by someone in the family who had visited it over a year before. im not sure if things have drastically changed or if we came on a very unlucky day but this was one of the most infuriating and disappointing meals weve had in a long ti 
"the food was terrible. we ordered some tagliatelle with shrimps and salmon and it was just boiled pasta and boiled shrimps and salmon also boiled, all in a sauce of curry. no taste, nothing"
"went here for lunch, great welcome, kind staff. was looking forward to the “angus burger with cheddar cheese etc "
"popped into this restaurant for the first time, and we were extremely disappointed, we ordered a starter, and a main, everything started off very well, we were served an amuse bouche, then our starter of scampi and salmon arrived scampi ok a bit tasteless , we then had to wait 45 minutes for our main course, which were oysters for my wife, and cod for me, when eventually it arrived we could see that my dish of cod had been left under and probably forgotten some sort of heating to keep it warm, on top of that it had no taste, and wasnt worth the wait, our carafe of wine was very mediocre the service was pretty slow,mind you they were pretty quick to clear our plates away, compared to other places weve eaten in sluis, this place was very little value for money."
"nice pasta and salad , good service. good place for a quick lunch while visiting sluis.  not that expensive for the quality you get"
"you can not fault the restaurants location on the quay in sluis, very good outside terrace, if a little crammed in. the menu is quite extensive but i found it a little overpriced, especially the soft drinks. the food quality is good howev "
ordered 4 portions of mussels @20 euros plus one salade nicoi 
"a very busy restaurant. but it ranks in the all form no function scale. the thai curry took 45 minutes. once delivered a few of the pieces of chicken were raw. no one asked about the obviously raw pieces carefully moved out of the center of the bowl. the bill for the raw chicken, one water and one wine was 28€. praying i don’t also pay with illness later today.

"we visited sluis yesterday, it was around half past one when we arrived and looked for a place to eat. this place looked nice (and it is). my wife ordered pea soup (not snert, which is a very heavy pea puree soup), i ordered a saté. we both had a glass of wat "
"we regularly have lunch in this restaurant. many people here are regular guests. i took the oven baked fish with wine sauce, it excelled in being tasteless. my wife took the flemish stew and enjoyed it a lot. depending on what you take you will enjoy it more or less. the service is always very friendly."
"not quite sure if they have a shortage of menu cards, but when we asked for one, we were told to ask the people at another table for one!! the restaurant was almost full inside and very hot and smelt very fishy, so outside it was, luckily it warmed up and it was pleasant to sit there.when we finally got hold of a menu, and ordered, the food was good. my husband had lasagne, my friend, scampi in garlic butter, and mine was a delicious goat cheese salad. the food was very good, the service a bit less, but maybe they just had too much work. we intended staying for dessert, and once again asked for a menu, as there were none around, but that did seem to be a problem, so when no menu arrived, we decided just to get the bill instead and left."
"we were looking precisely for a good italian resto in sluis and mineral had best marks on tripadvisor. it looked pretty good at the beginning and was full of people (most ordering pizza). in fact, we got self made sparkling water (6,5 euro/bottle.. ); tomato soup was a disaster (too hot, with too much salt and huge pieces of tomatoes - obviously from cane); pasta was ok (i would give 6 points from 10); but service made it all.. young lady who served us was tired and definitely not interested in tips, she simply picked the order, delivered food without any word, ignored coffee and bill (though she confirmed the order, we never received our espresso and i had to go to the bar to pay dinner myself). nothing to be added, we will not come back. "
first vist to sluis for me for 20 years. never bothered to go back as it was just very small with lace and porn sho 
"have visited this eatery previously & has always been ok. however, on a recent visit to sluis me & my husband decided to have lunch here, now they welcome people from uk but do not have an english menu which i find ignorant & not very keen to explain their menu. that said we selected a tuna baguette each & a beer & diet coke. as we don’t speak dutch, we failed to notice a sur charge on all baguettes of 1.50 euros on top of the price of a standard roll. this took our total bill to 26 euros!!! really for 2 blooming rolls & 2 drinks i’m sorry this is a real rip off & we will never be going back. we did approach the waitress who conveniently said we should have asked: we did & she chose to not understand us. what a rip off!!! avoid as very expensive without sur charges for baguettes."
"we stayed at de lingehoeve for three nights and ate in the restaurant once. ive described it as interesting because it could be very good but lets itself down by things that you think might be easily rectified. for example: (1) our room had no discernible number and no key, so we couldnt lock our door from the outside. once we came back to find the door ajar! (2) they didnt serve breakfast on a monday morning before 9 am! (they did eventually agree to leave us a tray out, and the breakfast itself was good.) (3) there were coffee and tea-making facilities in the room but no coffee or tea! (4) on the sunday, although no one made up our room, they did leave us some clean towels (but left the dirty ones!). (5) the lounge has great antique furniture but none of it was polished, or even dusted. (6) the food, which was all a surprise(!), was well cooked and well presented, but both the tuna and duck were almost raw, which is not to everyones taste and sending back food is always disruptiv "
"bad service, bad info, burned bitterballen .... something so simple and not bring able to do that at a normal (basic) level of quality is reason to reconsider whether you should be open for business, accepting people’s money ..."
"never in my life have i been treated this badly in a restaurant or cafe and i have been to many. the main waitress offended me when i asked after 20 minutes if my order came through than, after 40 minutes in total., still nothing while she looked at our table often. i told her and she just shrugged her shoulders. not even a sorry or surprised look...."
"terrible customer service, careless attention to quality and taste of food served. i ordered an apple tart with nuts. it was served super cold, not really able to taste anything given the serving temperature. when asked to warm up, i was told they had no time to do so. ambiance / space is nice but that is it!

sorry but it was really not oke. first i was told to order direct because i could only have breakfast untill 11.00 but i was there at 10.35. then i orderded pancakes. this was really bad. they were very dry and hard with a spoon of jam on it. it looked and tasted like nothing. for 10 euro 
"the restaurant is in old greenhouses just outside leiden. visited on a sunday at lunchtime. its very family friendly,  so lots of kids. the food was good if not a little pricey. service was mixed but friendly enough."
"we were given a table in a very noisy place, next to the bar with a very high traffic, people, waitresses passing by, sounds of dishes glasses etc while there were other tables available. the table was not clean, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. it took really long between serving the drinks and ordering food. the food was not warm enough while it was served and the quality vs price was pretty law. i had a feeling i came to a come-eat-go place. poor hospitality."
"cannot comment on food as i could not taste it but found the behaviour of waitress extremely rude. i had been there with my 7 year old son to celebrate fathers day and had requested for a table for two. we were flatly declined and were asked to pick up something from the takeaway joint nearby. the waitress didnot even bother to suggest on a waiting time incase we wanted to wait. i could see lots of couples after us being escorted in who also didnot have any reservations hence could not really fathom the behaviour. in my so many years of stay in netherlands have not come across such a behaviour, may be waitress was having a bad day. stay blessed."
"beautiful view on a sunny day, very nicely designed space, love hanging plan "
"place looks very nice inside. i went there just for a quick drink with my bf after spending some time at the beach. the waitress in the entrance wasn’t very friendly, i’ve been asked in quiete aggressive way if she could help me with somethin "
"the food was nice (although a bit too garlicy), but the service could be much much better. they served us beer in a cracked glass, there was a hair in my plate and it was full of spider webs..."
"i had dinner here last night. the starters were good (a.o. the bieterbal), but the tuna steks were overcooked and not warm! (we specifically asked this before ordering). then they brought us the halibut dish and a quinoa burger. not very much flavour on both. so this was an average experience. great service and good espressos."
"nice location, friendly stuff, food bad. the meat was chewy, bland and for the quality too expansive. i would  not eat here a second time."
"i was refused service here on two occasions. let me elaborate. the first time i visited brasserie buitenhuis, it was about mid day i walked about 1 kilometer from my hotel and upon arrival i explained that my family had flown in earlier that day to leiden via amsterdam schiphol and was jet lagged. as a result i wanted like to get some take away food to carry for them. the man in charge explained that the dont do take away. understanding that some eateries dont do take away i simply left without any foo "

"went here for a simple lunch on a sunday. the service was terrible. we ordered snacks, and they came after 40 min. no warning that the wait was going to be long. no sorry for the delay. another 20 min to get cold wraps. the food was ok, but at that point, we just wanted to go. one more thing;the chicken wrap was way too spicy"
"ordered “kip pikant” at the office we noticed that the chicken was smelling strange (sour)... we returned to the shop and complained. no real excuse was given, only some other sandwiches were given in return "
unfortunately the location and presentation of the place does not come anywhere near how they run the pla 
"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."
"we had some bites in the afternoon : they were ok and although we had to wait very long, we got a very good service from one pers "
"went here for a 5-course dinner on a saturday evening, we came in early and were welcomed very friendly. the table was nicely setup, clean and spacious setup of the tables and (i love it) an open kitchen. first we were asked if we wanted and appetizer drink (which we agreed on), we took a white port and a cocktail. port tasted good, sweet but not too sweet for a pre-dinner drink. cocktail was tasty also and not too alcoholic. we sat for a good 4 hours, starting with an appetizer (4 actually), bread+oil+butter&sea-salt and then all courses came. some we had to wait for other tables to catch up with us as they prepared most as they could at once. without going to details into the food it was in one word: fabulous. you get really good value for what you pay, for real. but there is a catch, several in fact, which will keep this restaurant from earning (or being eligible to earn) a real dutch michelin guide star. that being: the girls werent all dressed as it should, although they wore the same dress, one had white shoes under them, other black. also the restaurant is shared with the brasserie, and you see (as they share the kitchen) a lot of movement between the two which can be disturbing. also (even before the busy part) one of the girls left leaving essentially one girl (with sometimes help of second one) to serve all tables, resulting in the chef serving dinner for some courses). also the toilets (and paths to them) werent in match what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. not the cleanest, empty (supermarket style) soap and you could just walk out on the backside and into the (dishwasher part) of the kitchen. that area could use a re-style. but, as food is the most important thing in a restaurant, next to the service (which was, dont get me wrong, good) i do give this place a good review, also because the price really values the experience. so, for a great evening out i would highly recommend this place."
the last time we ate in the restaurant it was excellent and we were keen to go ba 
we went the day after the flower show to see the floats. it was awful. we had to force our way through the packed street which was like running a gauntlet of sales pitches and open air pubs. when we finally got to the floats they seemed like a tired afterthought and we had to queue to pay eight euros to see the

"waited one hour for salads and 12 uurtje lunch which is a simple combination of typical dutch food elements,easy to cook. incredible. it was ok taste but obviously nobody cares anymore if you have to wait one hour. juice not fresh.  not."
"we arrived at noon in plenty of time for the flower parade and got served drinks fairly quickly but our order of 3 tostis, 2 roast beef sandwiches and 1 smoke salmon and prawn sandwiches did not arrive despite frequently hailing a server. eventually at 1 o.clock the tostis arrived they looked pretty insipid and seemed like dried bread rather than toasted bread. after more complaints we eventually got one of the roast beef sandwiches at 1.15. finally we left at 1.30 still without food for 2 of our party. we just left the money on the table because we didnt even get the bill but we had to go to take our seats. go there if you dont mind waiting for hours."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."
"good burgers, good beers and finger food in a nice setting decorated with teddy bears. service is a little slow though."

"good food for a good price. nothing fancy or special but always a good place to have a meal with family or friends. the beeren restaurant in roosendaal is similar in quality to the other beren restaurants. although this one is a bit bigger than most ive visit, more spacious. staff is friendly."
a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"
"i visited the singraven estate with friends. we had a light lunch at this restaurant - pancakes. a very nice setting, with good quality food and reasonable prices."
the restaurant is very nice located in an ols water mill in a beautiful suurounding. the food is not bad but gives the idea that they did not change for at least twenty five years
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."

excellent meat...no question about it....you can order it in any weight you might want and they show you the pieces almost like in a butchershop:what you see is indeed what you get 
"this restaurant and party centre looks and feels upper class and their dishes also provide that impression. the food is pretty good but not that good. and what should make it complete - efficient staff, cozy atmosphere etc - are not upper class. certainly a nice place but not as advertised. "
"as described in several reviews here: this restaurant has been part of conspiracy-theories for years. they actively discourage vaccines, making the whole place unsanitary. there is a lot of propaganda to throw away face masks etc. i used to love to go here in the past, but its become a temple of doom."
"i made a reservation for my mother and a group of her friends for her 75th birthday. the event manager was aware that it was a special day and we specifically requested a table in the restaurant, not one of the separate rooms because they were too large and unsuitable (which the event manager agreed). literally 48 hours in advance, they cancelled the reservation because they had taken on a larger group (funeral). my mother was offered one of the separate rooms which we previously agreed upon were unsuitable for the occassion (too large and too business like). it seems a friendly, organic place, but in the end it is all about the money. do not be fooled."
"the first “cool” day in weeks, but just comfortable enough to start our dinner outside on the terrace of this very nice situated restaurant. the “spitskool kroketjes” had little “spitskool” and a lot of “roux” in them and were not crunchy, but there was a nice salad on the plate. then my main course. instead of a quiche with some salad on the side what i had expected what i got was a huge plate of salad with the same ingredients i had in my starter salad and on the edge of the plate 6 or 7 cubes of very tasty quiche, but not half enough. i didn’t want that whole plate of greens. the proportions in that quiche plate were all wrong. my friend enjoyed her “rundvlees met ratatouille”. being the only guests outside they seemed to forget us and we went in to have a coffee. and still no-one asked us whether we enjoyed our meal, whether we would like a dessert. inexperienced personnel? just bad luck? not an evening that triggers you to come back!"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
"the location is beautifull, the reataurant is very cosy. unfortunately the menu is quit limited. there;s not that much to chose for. we ordered a salade for staters. the waitress told us that the salade was quit big for one person. so we split it and that was a good idea. the salade was big, tasty and looking good. we had the goat chesse salde. i can recommendit to y "

no idea how the food is. kitchen closes at 20h whilst they mention the restaurant closes at 22h. very confusing and no alternatives close by very dissapointing.
"very poor and slow service.  noisy, crying and running kids. food is not great. this restaurant is even worse than average dutch cafes"
more occupied of speed and sales than of the wellbeing of the customers. nice location but a litte cheap(ish)
"we went there because it was near to our holiday home and there were not many restaurants open that day. place is big but still feels cramped. food was very poor. io had a duck breast without any taste. it was served on an undefined kind of mashed potatoes that had no taste itself, but it was drowned in some gravy, of which i suspect it was just made of granules. next time when im in the neighborhood i will take a longer drive to find a decent for a dinner."

the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at €1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."

"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldn’t be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when it’s busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a ‘broodje haring’ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"stopped here via boat for a drink and snack. beautiful view of lake and nice deck, but very slow and inattentive service. at the slow pace of service ran out of time to even order food..."
"together with a friend we had a nice stay, thanks to the great location and the nice, friendly services. the dishes on menu card are very average, probably still going strong (as most restaurants have), not a single surprise. we both chose for the spare ribs (3 half pieces p.p., but more than enough) with two sauces and some pommes frites, but nothing else served with it... the spare ribs were average of quality of meat, but tasteful (we give it the benefit of the doubt), the sauces (bbq and aioli) were good of taste (however do not kiss your partner afterwards...), but probably not fresh made. as a dessert we had the ananas panna cotta and the - old fashioned - dame blanche 2.0, both creative presented and very tasteful. the espresso and the cappuccino afterwards were of good quality."

"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
i have eaten here with my sisters wedding. i didnt think they did anything special for her. the menu was boring and didnt tast great.
"we visited this restaurant after quite some time for dinner again. the 4-course menu was good, food was delicious. but the service can be improve "
"because the restaurant has a michelin star we had high expectations. the food was ok, nicely presented, the service is very good and friendly. but the chef is super conservative when it comes to flavors, i just expected more."
very disappointed as reputation was so good. not a lot of taste. mismatch in taste. the only good dish was the duck. where does the star come from?
on may 30th had a 6 course dinner in this restaura 
"small restaurant with bad acoustics and really bad chairs. but we proceeded, against our first impression. it took them 35 minutes to get us three plates with “tapas”. shrimps were still cold and watery from the fridge, the carpaccio was watery, the french frites were raw. the spare ribs in two small bowls were not bad. woth five we received a small bread, two slices per person. we asked to taste the “wine” and was denied. bad tasting wine at a price of € 6,50 per glass, ridiculous price for wine from the lidle. the salmon was really bad, out of the fridge. we had to pay to much, they wouldn’t argue but in the end we received €30 back. still we payed way to much for bad prepared food."
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as it’s very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"it took quite some time before anybody took our order for some drinks. it took even longer to bring us the menu, furthermore we tried to order some more drinks but nobody was paying attention to us, although the restaurant itself is quite small. the starter didnt match the description of the menu so that was a dissapointment, staff had no real explanation for this. the main course chicken on a skewer was undercooked so by that time i was done. they served the plates out one at the time so by the time the last person of our group had his dinner the first dishes were cold. they forgot to bring my dessert so i was done for. too bad since my previous dining experience here was much better...."
"so hard to resist the apple pie and when we were cycling past the menu board at lely, we had to stop! morning tea time anyway! lovely al fresco area in an open town square,with plenty of seating, very attractive flower baskets and pots, added to the atmosphere. friendly staff too all made for a pleasant interlude, and glad we stopped here."
"never actually leave any reviews but felt like i had to as this restaurant clearly does not deserve the status they claim to have. reserved a table at 20:00, because they are working in shifts but then it appears they don’t as a long line was waiting for a table (where they made a reservation for) but which wasn’t free/ ready. very unprofessional service, when we joined friends of ours at another table and actually in that way solved the staff their problem they asked us ‘to check the bill ourself and arrange this ourself’ this was very rude. young, unprofessional staff who clearly don’t have any experience in hospitality related businesses. food was ok, but don’t ask for these high prices when your service is this poor"
it a local restaurant trip advisor describe it as one of the best places in the area i beg to differ food is reasonable nothing exciting service could improve  the waiter did not know whats campari orange. the location good reasonably priced
"too expensive for very average food in a worn out ambiance, poor unprofessional service and a long wait. the nearby ara hotel restaurant is a much better option."
"what used to be a good (always overpriced) place, turned into worse. waiter not interested for his guests, waiting too long to get ordered bread. my “tompouce” of asperges and smoked salmon was very bad. the crust was soft lile a sponge. even mentioning this was a confirmation at nothing more. ordered different ways of preparing our two soles, but when it was served theydid not have any clue. the asperges on a side where overcooked and too much lemon used. and than the price still overprized"
"i havent been there for a while. so to me it came as a surprises that the interior as been changed into a trendy restaurant look and feel. but thats the only change. still the same smooth service, delicious white wine and a lobster. main courses are mostly around the 25 eu "
"restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a nice retro style before, but after a change in ownership it has become quite dull without any real decorations. i came to waal with my girlfriend quite early so there were barely any people. we wanted to sit next to the windows, however the waitress told us it was impossible because the seat was reserved for people with a dog. i could understand it for one of the seats, but there were a total of five seats still vacant! finally the waitress gave us a seat in the back of the restaurant, even though the place was almost empty! after asking a waiter if we could change seats to a seat near the window he told us it was no problem and was also amazed the girl said it was not possible. after we changed seats the waitress who showed us the seat in the first place was talking with other waitresses and all of a sudden they all looked our way! not a comfortable feeling. as a starter we ordered a carpaccio which was absolutely delicious. for the main course i ordered the pasta pesto and my partner ordered the half lobster with soup. my pasta was not great, but also not bad. the lobster itself was great, but the soup we got in the first place was quite sour. we were told in the first place that we could have as much soup as we wanted. at first a waitress, who seemed to be a new worker, came to us with a small pot with the soup inside. when my partner asked to give us a bowl to fill with soup instead of pouring it on a plate with rice a more senior waitress came and reacted very strong and unfriendly that we could have a bowl once we finished this plate. after the first bowl a friendly older waiter came to us with more soup and also offered to put some liquor in the soup, why the waitress didnt offer this in the first place is unclear... because my partner liked the soup she wanted another bowl, however the waitress said it was not possible because they were out of soup(?!) it was still early so we knew this was very strange, finally the woman said it was not that they were out but the last bit in the pot was not edible so they wouldnt give us, even though we could see last time the waiter came there was still plenty of soup in the pot. after confronting the waitress she said that if we wanted more we had to order a soup for 10 euro!!! in the end she gave in and gave us another lobster soup, however this one was much more delicious than the one offered together with the lobste "

"... would have liked to be informed upfront that we would not be sitting in the actual restaurant but one of the (albeit nice) other rooms in the castle. it was very noisy and the music could hardly be heard, albeit at some stage it was put louder but with music that had nothing to do with christmas. service was friendly but not always efficient and we needed to explain about our special request three times and still the wrong cutlery and courses were put on the table. the food was high quality as was the wine. and again, location location location. could have been very good but because of the flaws not sure i would book again next year."

"ma moeder is located in the middle of the buzy shopping streets of hoogvliet. on a sunny saturday, which is just inviting for a lunch outside we selected ma moeder as our destination. menu card is not excessive, so with few dishes on the card, we expected good food as well. we selected a dutch delicatese kroket sandwich, however never have i seen such a sad dutch lunch before. kroket was warm and crisp (from the friture) - like we expected, but bun was cold. no butter was served along with the sandwish - only a small tube of mustard, which didnt even cover half the bun. no decoration on plate and anything elsewhich gives you are feel good experience. staff dressed in cargo pants and jeans shirt, so in my eyes not really presentable at a restaurant eith "

"cote du bouef was most expensive dish, had 60% fat, three staff members came to review. no sympathy, that is the way it should be. the chimicurru sauce was not fresh, did taste bad. 1st and last time for me. total dissapointment. "
beautiful location close to the lake however service is too slow and lengthy despite of the very basic and simple menu list. not sure if we want to come back.
opening hours not accurate. it states this restaurant is open to 21:45. we arrived around 20:40 and they said they were closed. very disappointing but on the positive side we then stumbled across groucho’s which was amazing and serves food till late! we arrived well after 21:00 and made very welcome by all staff. we’ll be back!

"nice atmosphere, food/drink was good, service was moderate, table reservation was not taken seriously."
boss is a bit loud with a faux friendly attitude. fake. my waitress was fairly welcoming but the one handling the payment was rude. they asked to be paid cash. cheese salad was was nice though. mineral water was good too. overall a disappointing experience.
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice. "
we dicide to eat something. after 20min of waiting for service were go somewher else!!! and that was the best decision.  dont go there!   there was bot so many ppl. it wasnt rush hour...
we stopped here simply for drinks. saantje has a pleasant outside terrace area. the inside looks good to 
"the fries are alright, but i had to wait ages to get them. even though there were just a few customers and seven people working..."
"terrible service. our order wasn’t brought completely. bittergarnituur should be 16 pieces but we’ve got 12 pieces. the calamaris didn’t come at all. after saying our complaints 3 times they told us ‘i don’t know’, the other person said: ‘i will check for you’ and didn’t do anything at all. me and my friends will not come here in the future and i recommend you didn’t either."
"told them we had 50 minutes to eat, they said no problem. 45 minutes later they told us they can’t serve us and they have cancelled our order. skip this and go to san blas instead."
"the roast chicken and rose pinot grigio were nice. a coupe of service matters not so good. but seeing as erwin (at the bar) demonstrated that this place does actually value its customers, i’ll just put those down to random bad luck!"
"to the snack counter: one of the worst customer experiences ever. staff was continuously talking to each other. because of that pretty slow service and messing up the orders. the male chef was super charming to his female colleague while chatting. but he was very rude to the customers. these were already talking to each other, upset because of the poor service and even poorer treatment by the chef. horrible!"
"parnassia has a nice terrace. the menu looks okay, although on the pricey side. waiters asked us literally every minute if we had made our choice already, a bit too eager to my tast "
"modern beach club with a long history and beautiful terrace with view on the beach. the friendly waitress served us a average caesar salad (iceberg lettuce, chicken, cheese and dressing), we had better lunches this week."
the location is really beautiful at he top of a dune. perfect place for a sundowner. the service is pretty chaotic. there are many people running around but it is not always easy to get ones attention. the first two orders were sold out. my third choice was just ok. cleanliness in times of corona can also be better.
this place definitely needs competition. being in a monopolist position for ages at this location successive managers apparently never felt the need to provide their guests a better service (cheeky staff members) and value for money. enjoy the beach but spend your money elsewhere.
"this restaurant has one option for gluten/lactose intolerant person ( double checked with the manager), chicken breast. got them raw, not only once but twice(after sending them back)! before i was able to take a second zip from my drink the waiter took it. so no food and nothing to drink! i would recommend the beach for your dog but not this restaurant!"
"if its busy, service is slow. if it isnt, the place will be understaffed, and service is slow. its the only game in town, so tough luck."
the steak was alright and the sauce was great. but serving casino bread that feels stale or too little toasted is a crime against humanity. the food is not cheap and the bread which seems a very cheap and bad alternative takes away a lot from the experience. the same sauce with a proper homemade bread would have been amazing. sadly i cannot give any more points as i cannot forgive the mediocrity of the casino bread.
i’m sorry but this is absolutely unforgivable for me to see in a restaurant with this price range. store bread served with a 22 euro steak? no ma’am this is just u-n-f-o-g-i-v-a-b-l-e.
you just lost 4 loyal customers.... 4 people who have been coming here regularly for a number of years... we fully understand that most restaurants in the current situation do more seating slots to accommodate the approved number of customers... well .. at loetje you are given 1.5 hours.. that is ridiculous... this is not a pizza place but somewhere you go to enjoy a nice meal... we had starters and then had to wait 50 mins for our mains to arrive.. just as we barely finished we basically got kicked out as our slot was up. for a bill of 250 euro for 4 that is unacceptable and pure money making tactics .. every other restaurant in haarlem in this price range will give you 2 - 2.5 hours for your meal which is perfectly fine but 1.5 h is a complete joke ... don’t expect us or any of our friends back any time soon

"we stopped for a coffebreak at this restaurant. it was a quiet weekdag morning, so only about 10 - 20 other guests were there. after ordering, nothing happened. when we asked about 15 minutes later, they went inside to check again. the response was that the order was completely forgotten about."
"had steak at loetje several times at several different locations. the steak is always great, good descent food. cant go wrong with steak and fries. service was disappointing last time around, no attention what so ever!"
"after a good visit in january we returned and stayed in the hotel for a short break in august. whilst the rooms were lovely, our holiday was ruined by the rude unhelpful restaurant staff. twice we were forgotten when ordering drinks and when i went to the bar to sort it out, i was completely humiliated. the girl behind the bar shouted over to a waitress who said our order was on its way. nearly 25 mins after ordering a drink i went back to the bar again and was shouted at by the waitress with shoulder length curly hair. hey miss mistakes happen!!! no apology. we had our wine and ate elsewhere. will not return or recommend."
"been here a few times now but i cant see the appeal. too busy, overpriced and having to order everything separately does not do it for me. i hear a lot of people positive about this location so you probably need to try yourself and judge (as with everything) but i wont be back. "
"my experience here was disappointing. i had tried loetje steaks at a food fair in amsterdam and had high expectations for this restaurant. not only the steak was disappointing (not very tasty and buried in butter / oil), but also the service was very very slow. the restaurant was only half full and we very served the main meal after more than 1 hour from the starter! i will not go back here."
"been a few times, but the last time was the last. 2 hours between drinks and main course, need i say more? horrible service and the food only so so. i hate giving negative reviews and never do. on top of waiting. they brought us the wrong dish and when a friend mentioned this the cook was incredible rude and arguative so much so that another cook came to apologise on his behalf. they said it was really busy because it was nice weather out, but then they should be prepared for busy times. food is only so so, tastes massed produced. there are better places around to eat including two places across the street. "
"we had dinner with friends here, had carpaccio and dutch new herring with toast as starters. it was good, it took like more then half an hour to get the empty plates off our table. inasked tontake the toast as well....the waiter said inwanted to leave that for thevsteak! i was like: ???. we ordered steaks, regular and xl ones. the regular were served very very well done even hard to chew on. ive never had that before to be honest. the solved it but the price is that you dont eat together, which i think is a bummer. the plates took forever to get taken away. it was busy in the restaurant but not grazy busy as it can be at restaurants of loetje. i sometime think that staff thinks  hey youre at loetje, you better know it i on the other hand think, well we pay your salary! the desserts, bonbons, coffee and afterdinner drinks were good. maybe i need a loetje break"
"all of the loetje restaurants are good, but it must be time to have the menus reviewed and updated, it would be nice to see more seasonal specials, as the food on offer becomes very limited, steak, liver, salad. please make this lovely restaurant worth more visits."
"loetje opens new restaurants like i change shoes. yesterday lunch with friends at loetje in overveen. 4 waitresses who excel in not having (eye)contact with the customer on an almost empty terrace. eventually we could order drinks and sandwiches. the tuna looked good, but the mozzarella on white bread was one soggy sponge. brr. crispness was certainly not the case so i wondered how old the sandwiches were. at least one day old."
"a nice vibe here, a large space thats hip and modern. decent service. the beer selection was adequate. i had the steak bali which was pretty tasty. a good experience."
"we made reservations a month ago. i found the service...not as a was used to, which is a bummer! had to ask for water twice. waiter spoiled wine while pooring it! ordered hollandse garnalen for starter, got the snack instead!!! ordered steak bali, got regular....came back whit a spoon of sambal smacked on it!! fries were way too salt. had to ask for wine again! i fou d it sad service this time! the steak and ordered salad was good! one of the plates with fries was really half fulled with mayonaise! redicilous! if i get this another time well have a discussion....for real!"
this chain is growing out of its comfortable origin in amsterdam it is clearly difficult to maintain the original standard in atmosphere.
"stopped here with friends coming back to ams from the beach. place is ok, quality of the steak was average. not that great, but at least service was nice."
"id booked a quiet table here on a monday night. walked in and am taken to a table in the middle of the restaurant, 2 inches from a table filled with very loud girls. naked light bulbs over our heads. i couldnt hear someone sitting opposite  "
"on the basis of excellent reviews of the steaks i tried here. the service was very average - after i arrived it took a long time before i was acknowledged or seated. they dont take advance reservations other than for parties of more than 6, which is irritating. the room was fine but quite casual and the acoustics were noisy - not the best choice for a business meeting. the steak, chips and salad was fine but not exceptional. menu entirely in dutch so you may struggle if you dont speak the language. all in all a good place for a casual meal with friends but not somewhere for something more formal or romantic."

"we took the alliance four course menu. the portions are quite small and we found that not all the tastes came out of the different dishes being served. the waitress drowned my first course of north sea crab with the green herb dressing. there was little taste of the sole in the second course, although the truffle sauce was quite delicious. the third course was a bit of a disaster for my wife as she found buckshot in the hare. this was explained away as being risk of the trade. not something you would expect from a restaurant of this standard. the cheese trolley was excellent and with a glass of good port made up for what for us was quite a disappointing experience."
"we had diner with *dining with the stars* in this 2 star michelin restaurant. the service was ok. one girl was really friendly we sat out on the terras with a marvelous view. the sun protectings were white and very dirty, should me replaced immediately. the small tables should be vernised as the are ba "
dropped in for a short coffee break during my bike ride from zaandvort. ordered coffee and pie. didnt get my order for over 15 minutes. when someone came by to ask if everything is okay they told me that my order got screwed up with another table. they promised me i would get it now very soon. after again way over 10 minutes i was just about to leave when it finally arrived. now they said it had been ordered for the wrong table number. didnt seem very apologetic. pie was okay but nothing to write home about. coffee was too small for the price.

t eindpunt is a good place to eat after a day at the beach. staff is friendly. food is ok and served quickly. pricing is average. dining outside is fine but be aware of the direction of the wind otherwise your fun will be ruined.
nice restaurant we have been going to for years. menu us ok and food quality is good. unfortunately not really good options for vegetarians nor for vegans. that is a bit if a shame as more and more people follow such diets.
"played here as a child, hiding in the hollow tree (now a bronze replica) and spending energy running up and down the dunes. now apple-speck pancakes for old times sake."
"visited middle of the heatwave and charged 3 euro for a jug of tap water - why you ask (?) because i was told the germans always ask for it - so what, it’s water from a tap and i had two thirsty children - nope, still 3 euros. quite unbelievable - have never paid for tap water anywhere. "
"if you are extremely hungry and looking for just a quick meal with nice pancakes and you are without children, you should no go here "
we were a party of 6 looking to eat a snack . . . . pancak 
"the location is good for a quick bite when you are heading to or from zandvoort. we tried several pancakes and i must say that their pancakes are average. some pancakes were ok but some were not that tasty, it misses something. but its good for a quick snack. "
"the location is great. it takes, however, very long to order and even longer to get what you ordered. the lemonade is good, the food is just ok, but not if you take the expensive prices into consideration. there are better places around."
"we wanted to eat something on the beach in bloomingdale and spontaneously went to the beach club. we were allowed to choose a table and from then on it was over with the service. everyone who came after us was served except us. only when my wife went to serve did someone come to our table. we were served reluctantly, probably because we are germans. no recommendation!!!"
"the food itself tasted fine, actually it was such a small portion that we need to go to the fastfood place around the corner to eat something else. unfortunately the prices say something different. "
"we went for drinks on a sunny busy afternoon. we were with 3 people and 3 more were joining quickly after, so we asked a 6 persons table. this was not possible because they only give tables to ‘full groups’?! when our 3 friends arrived there was a still a table next to us available so we asked personnel if our friends could sit there, which was agreed to. when they wanted to sit down, it was suddenly not possible anymore, because we were not a ‘full group’ from te beginning?! very rude and we left. 1 star is for the pornstar martini which was good. however i will drink my martini somewhere else next time. not recommend "
evening visit. noisy. busy. food average. service slow.   good location on beach and for families during the day might be better.   no return for me.
we were there on a day the weather was not very sunny and likely to rain so there were not many people. the service was quick and ok. prices are as expected near beach rather high.
"service was appalling. once we had eaten, plates were not cleared. neither were the tables around us. by the time we paid the table next to us had been piled with half eaten smelly leftovers for an hour. it actually made me sick. even specifically asking a waitress to clear our plates failed, she just took another table’s money and left never to retur "
"i waited about 20 min before asking the hostess how can i order. she said i had to wait for a waiter to come for my order. well, ok house rules. waited another 15mins counting how many waiters pass by me and on “5” i just left. "

"we asked for an english menu, which came after 15 minutes; the waitress was rude, arrogant and helpless, she forgot the beer and she insisted in saying i didnt order ir, so she borought after 10 minutes. food is average, do not order cocktails cos they are not worth at all. service is the worst experienced in the latest years. "
"great location, nice loungy music and a beautiful setting, that is about it for the positives. pretty much everything else was wrong. no one came to serve our table, we waited, runners will not serve tables (understandable) but waiter never came. flagged one down for drinks and dinner. it was 17:45, kitchen opened at 18:00 so we could not order but also menu was not offered. took our drinks order, attitude was snotty & arrogant. drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, one of the pepsi bottles was used?! about 1/3 of the bottle was empty, we needed to inform the staff. no apologies and it took another 5 mins for replacement. for the rest, dirty tables are left dirty, menus are not cleaned away, ashtrays not cleaned. loungers are at an extra € but even these guests had to go to the bar to order. i saw rubbish on tables and floors that was not cleaned, broken glass that was not cleared etc. staff does not seem to be bothered to serve or work in general. softdrinks at €3,50 for 0,2l are expensive, due to location but we left without ordering food or asking for the menu. no comment from the waiter when we did not ask for a menu or order food but he was even expecting a tip which was the icing on the cake. would not recommend, place needs training and proper management. wish i had checked reviews before we sat down."
"from opening the door there was an immediate feeling that we had entered the twilight zone, but as good masochists we stayed to see what this place can offer. the staff was running around in a zombie like state, and nobody noticed us. finally we managed to draw the attention of one of them, and were pointed at an available table. everything that we ordered was disgusting and not as described on the menu. bruschetta with burrata. never seen anything like th "

"keep looking for a top spot and move up north 20-50 km, this is one of those places people go to be seen but nothing special and you pay a tough price..."
there is one thing i have to admit: this place has a good location other than that i would not suggest this place at all. first of all we waited around 20min until the waiter came to take the order. then we specifically had to ask to clean the table of the previous guests. once i had ordered a burger of 17€ i receive have of a portion of fries. this is disappointed me in service and i have to say its not worth my money at all. this was my first and absolute last time.

"since the sun came out again today we decided to go for a walk with the dog in the late afternoon and chilled out afterwards @ bloomingedales with some nice but rather expensive drinks followed by a dinner. our friend had a steak dinner, my hubby the tuna and i had the chicken sateh. it all tasted good and the good thing is that you can take your dog with you!"
"avoid this place at all costs. the setting is great which makes it tempting, but it isnt worth it. the staff were disinterested and - at times - openly rude. our order was completely messed up, the food is expensive and although we didnt let this place ruin a lovely day out, we certainly would never return. "
dropped by for some dinner and cocktails. it was pretty difficult to place an order since the staff wasnt paying any attention. after asking three runners to get somebody to take our order we finally met a waitress at our table. roughly 20 minuten had passer and the place was only occupied for  
very bad experience. slow waiters and very long waiting time for drinks and food.   cheesy waiters.  no go for this first sunny day of the year.

we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff don’t seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend.

"the spot, close to the small harbor, makes it a perfect place for drinks and sit and watch the boats go by. we had hoped more from the dinner, it was quite average and the fish dish (small soles) was not sufficient for an adult eater. service is friendly though."
"very convenient for lunch or diner when you have your boat at the harbor of bornzwaag. they have a varied menu with emphasis on fish and meat dishes. the lamb curry was good, but not at all spicy. a good wine selection."
"a cozy, comfortable place to enjoy the outdoor terrace. we ordered a few drinks and an appetiser. the drinks were warm and the appetiser was pretty bad, it seems to be from a frozen package. a deep fried item called biterbollen; we have had these all over the area and these were by far the worst. they werent very hot and were doughy and bland. after that, i would not return for anything but the view. "
food was good and ok but very unkind waiter also to my child of 4 years. very unsociable and not friendl.
"we came for dinner with 4 people on a wednesday night. we had to wait a long time before we could order and after 40 minutes bread still had not arrived, we had to go and search for the waitress. when the bread did arrived it came at the same time as our starters. there was a large group of people having dinner in another room and the staff was busy. we also had to wait very long for the main courses and to get another drink, another search for the staff was needed. no excuus from the staff nothing, we didnt feel welcome here! the food was nothing special, nice fish but no vegetables were served only a bowl of salad to share with 4 people and some fries."
"probably the best fast food/ fries place in the area. this is our regular supplier for a once-a-week fast food lunch with team. quality is consistent. on bank holidays, or on moment when you would expect the place to be open, then .... it is closed. and they can afford to do this, as theres no real competition in the are "

"i kept giving this place a chance as the food is good, and after our tenth visit we had to give up on the staff who kept ignoring up to the point we had to keep walking over to the bar during dinner. maybe they’re understaffed but it felt a bad taste after we’d spent so much money in there over the past year. it’s now off our list sadly."

"we enjoyed the ice cream very much but sadly as the card machine didn’t seem to accept international cards of any kind (pre-paid, debit, credit) which had worked elsewhere, we had to sit around with small children for over an hour while one member of our party travelled to the next town to withdraw cash. there should be a sign advising this."
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.

"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is oké except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"we planned to visit this restaurant for the lunch but as we saw theres a lot of people going inside, we cancelled it and chose other place. the building of the restaurant was former manor house and the town hall of middenbeemster."
"terrible, we arrived, sat down by the bar, waited for 10 minutes and no one came to take our order. barman was just in front of us and did not acknowledge us at all."
"it is nice and the view was ok, but i think you could turn the music down a little! the food was a solid 9/10 and the water was perfect temperature!!!!!!! but i think that a drinks menu would be good.the chicken burger was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the restaurant was very bright and happy!!! overall 4.

"absolutely awful. slow service, rubbish food and extremely over priced. €7.30 for a bottle of still water. then added money for ketchup and mayo that we didn’t ask for. €23 for a burger that’s not even good. avoid."
honestly horrible !!! service absolutely bad! cuttlery thrown literally at our face! quality black angus burger patty? not even in dreams. the meat taste like frozen frikandelle from a city fair truck! nothing to eat or drink there. definitely not worth the overpricing!
"i ordered drinks about 4 times and nobody brought the drinks so i’ve finished my meal without any drink, they brought just one drink of the four i’ve ordered at the end when i didn’t even want it anymore. the waitress didn’t even show up so it was very difficult to talk with her. so the service is nothing good for me."
the waitress did an appalling job of taking our ordering managed to get most of wrong. the food was delivered to the table and they almost flung it at us and went before we could say it was wrong at this point we were hungry and with our flight time getting closer we eat what we were give 
unbelievable slow service (20+ min just to be able to place order). way understaffed. the staff that was there didnt seem to care about customers having to wait.
"we got our drinks and food quickly, but the server never cane back. we needed refills of water and more drinks, but our server disappeared and nobody else came. we were charged for eight small containers of ketchup and mayonnaise that we didn’t order! we had to search for someone to pay and was then informed that they don’t divide checks. that is fine, but i have never eaten anywhere that didn’t communicate that before guests order their food. then when i checked my american express statement, they charged me twice! thank goodness, american express sorted this out for me! lesson learned- i should have checked the reviews before eating here."
"horrible service.  three tables ordered and served drinks before we decided to leave.  had plenty of time between flights, but 20 minutes if being ignored is unconscionable."
the common theme of the restaurant is food roulette. the drinks came out at a lighting pace to quench the thirst. the food however was a different story. when the food finally arrived the order was wrong and missing items. turns out the chef can’t read an order and nor can the server put half of it into the til 
"good choice of dishes,  not the usual airport selection. food freshly cooked in front of you. good service.  downside,  tables not cleaned between customers"
just appalling. food inedible. i think customers are expected to clear their own tables...see pictures... really was awful. if you want a burger go to mcdonalds...twice as nice and half the price 🙄
"i thought id get a lunch time snack here last week. i paid for it, but after half an hour it still hadnt turned up and i had a plane to catch. couldnt get a refund because the person whod taken the order had gone, and when they offered to give me a take away and promised they were bagging it up, even then after five minutes i was standing at the bar wondering where it was and just had to give up and get my pla "
"we had to search the restaurant for a table, once we finally found a table we had to then go and find menus as there were only kitchen staff and one lady behind the bar. whilst sitting we saw 5 mice running around the restaurant and under the food cabinets, so we very quickly left!"
"was confusing as we sat down and didnt get served. eventually went to bar and they said we are sitting in the wrong area and cant help, went to kitchen counter and was told quite abruptly to sit and wait for someone to come..when i said we had been waiting for a while they explained that our seating was outside of their restaurant. we had their restaurants menu on our table which had caused the confusion. thats all fine but then make a polite suggestion that we sit in the designated area to be served...not just say sorry cant do it! 😏 when we did move we still had to wait a while for the one poor waitress to come to us, and the miserable kitchen staff just snapped at her. terrible customer service... "
"horrible and angry service, not enough staff making the ones that are there to be angry. on google it says that they close at 21:30 however at 20:30 they send us away. when we asked if drinks were still possible they said no. even though the bar is still open. so we go to the bar and they are discussing their own times for closing even though its busy there. so we get served at the bar and want to find a seat. we pick a table where others are sitting as well. and they send us away even though other people are still sitting there with their drin "
"i ordered a rib eye but they told me it is not available. few minutes later another man ordered rib eye no problem. wtf? so i ordered burger, it was pre-heated and made probably few hours ago, came very dry and taste less. this place is not recommended."
very rude cook was very sarcaric. then completely ignored by the waiter.gave up after 15 mins and went to another restraunt.tbe place wasnt even that busy.
ordered the classic burger and a beer whilst waiting for the flig 
"absolutely terrible service from the bar staff, arrived at 8:40 told closed but then continued to serve others, swore at customer when asked why , i work for heineken and pass through here often , i was ashamed that they sell our brand if this is the serve they provide."
"i travel a fair bit for work… i don’t think i’ve ever had service poor enough to inspire me to write a review before. i never got the drink i ordered, the cesar salad was not very good, and service was inattentive even by european standards. think you have plenty of time to grab a bite to eat and still make your flight? maybe not if you eat here!"
"sat down with my partner and was approached by the old man waiter claiming i have to buy food to sit down and not just a drink, he got very aggressive when i told him no one else was eating around us only drinki "
"the waiter / manager was incredibly rude constantly albeit being the only server at the very busy restaurant- no excuse for complaining heavily to us when we asked for some ketchup that we didnt order it with the meal, then the drinks order was wrong and we was very polite at asking for the correct order.. again huge lamentation and when we arrived to ask for a table was just dismissed - it is very expensive but this is hands nmdown the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life! avoid!!"
"absolutely shocking service, waiters very rude. forgot parts of the order and then took a long time to rectify their mistake. also seen them being very rude to people who simply wanted to order. i could understand if the place was very busy but it honestly wasn’t that busy with many empty seats."
"i had the vegan seaweed burger. super tasty i have to say but not worth 21 euro. i know airport restaurants have hefty rents to pay, but still. to add further insult you get charged extra for ketchup and mayonnaise even though when you’re offered them it’s not obvious you’re being “upsold”. also, they won’t give you a glass of delicious dutch tap water. oh no, you have to buy a bottle of imported french water - 4.25euro for 25cl."
was told to pay later! barman put extra drink on! and said we ordered €14!  gave cash bk when caugh!!
"quite a comical visit to be honest. came at a time when airport was fairly busy. the restaurant had only one waiter, a few barman and a couple of chefs. the waiter was shouting to everyone who walked in the place this area is closed and was generally storming around very moody. we had asked a few questions on the menu and got back very rude and sarcastic replies from the einstein lookalike. icing on the cake was, our burger finally arrived which was a beef burger rather than the chicken burger we ordered. as we pointed this out the waiters response was... ok my mistake i will give this away and refund you thanks bye after we had just waited 30 minutes for the burger to be prepared."
"came here during a weeknight around 5pm, sat for 30 minutes before anyone even came to serve. despite asking for a menu / drink on 3 occassions. eventually they came over and asked if i had been served yet.. then advised me not to order as they were having technical issue "
"just got 2 coffees from that place, found out i had to pay €13 for those 2 “dirty waters” as coffee is a big word. awful! a legal robbery"
"unfriendly people legit so unhappy and rude, wanted to order something and the man with the grey hair is just unfriendly and rude"
"not the easiest review to do. the food, we both had the chicken burger, was nice, dressings were fresh and wasnt greasy at all, a good 3/5 however the service was shocki "
"last time i was here i ate in the jamie oliver restaurant. never again.....that was dire. this was so much better. the service was speedy, the food good, usual airport prices but thats to be expected. would choose this again when im next in schipol in july."
"we had a completely incompetent waitress. despite being very clear when we ordered, our food had to be brought back twice and it still ended up being wrong. she gave us the completely wrong burgers that were more expensive than the ones we originally ordered, instead of having them been taken back for a third time we just ate them and they said they would only charge for the ones we originally ordered. she then tried to charge for the more expensive ones again when we went to pay, if we hadnt been so thorough she may have gotten away with charging us more. she didnt apologise for any of the mistakes at all and at one point said we had ordered something that we didnt order. it was hard to enjoy the food or find any appealing feature when the service was that bad."
"the 1st time i went was february 2022, somehow they lost my orded so i had to wait ages. this time i ordered and waited for ages anyway, the only good thing is that i wasnt the only one waiting. luckily my plan was delayed."
"the waiter was just straight up rude and racist , didn’t see him give the same treatment to other caucasian customers. had to wait around to get service for a while . was just here for a layover but i vow never to eat /stop here again."
this was ok - a little over priced for the food that was served. probably will try a different main meal during my next layover however
"been here a few times now. normally, service has been very good. due to covid it has been quite quiet, but they are losing a lot of custom due to lack of staff and very slow service as a result. no signs indicating if table service or food/drinks only areas. people walked back out as they were asking me if i worked there and if there were any staff available! i realise its difficult to keep staff available at these times, but customers must be given the impression that they will get served even if it takes time. "
"we arrived late at the hotel and wanted some food and a drink. the axis bar had a good menu and an extensive drinks menu. the food was good and ticked the box, the atmosphere was great but it is so dark!! not very sociable!"
"wow, we were in a hurry, stopped at this place. plain food, 6,5€ for a carton cup of soup which basically tasted like boiled water. the sandwich also was of equal bad quality. once paid: plenty of tables to chose from where to sit… if you want to sit in someone else his dirt. overpriced, plain food and dirty."
i has to stay the whole night at the airport and the blonde girl working out there needs to learn how to treat the costum 
the worst place to go to at this airport. the staff is absolutely awful and the food was terrible.  to make matters worse i witness a mouse running around.
"got stranded one night at schiphol  unfortunately! 23-24october 23 food was good but the girl who served me wasn’t very friendly and how she spoke to me wasn’t very nice! got free food vouchers because of delays,wished i used it somewhere else!"
very rude staff. little knowledge of their food and their allergens menu is confusing. they had no tea or decaf coffee and i was rudely told to go elsewhere if i wanted these. go somewhere else!
paid €8.25 for a sandwich (hummus/avocado/salad) and was sick the whole night. i didn’t think this would be the kind of sandwich to go off so draw your own conclusion as to why i was sick…
"want to queue and be stared at by staff without any of them answering your questions, and be made to feel like you’re brain damaged? this is the place for you! €7.30 for two croissants in a plastic bag as well (just to give you an idea of the price). sandwich tasted like paper. great experience!"
paid 11 euros for a breakfast with a croissant and a horrible coffe. come here for the chips maybe..
"i was travelling through schiphol during an evening. given the current covid pandemic i was not surprised to find many food outlets shut, but conveniently amsterdam bread co was ope "
this restaurant is located in the transferarea. a sandwich costs about 7 euro. there are some places to sit but you can also take away. the food tastet ok.
terrible experience with this joint. a whole lot of money for a absolutely not fresh sandwich. result: toilet visites and stomach acne almost richt after consument.
"very disappointing. the bread on my (expensive) sandwich was stale. given that all they do is make sandwiches, this is pretty poor. avoid."
cashiers were rude and the prices were high (as usually in the airport). food at least was decent. customer service (or the lack of it) was the reason for a bad review.
"they made our iced coffees piping hot, then claimed that thats how you always make iced coffees, hot..."
"we searched for coffee during our layover at the amsterdam airport. we passed several options, continuing to seek out a decent coffee shop but kept passing places that offered coffee from a machine. (yes, i’m a coffee snob i suppose). we ordered lattes here along with a pastry for each of us. average at best. as we were sitting and having our drink, i looked up to the second floor where i saw a starbucks. while i generally avoid that chain when there are other options, i did wonder if their amsterdam airport location prepared coffee in a legitimate espresso machine versus a push button coffee vending machine."
"i have never had such a disgusting caesar salad in my life. dry chicken, long salad strings with black edges and a sour dressi "
"food was overpriced and poor quality. there was at least 6 or 7 staff all standing around doing absolutely nothing when there was a long list of people waiting to be served. they all seemed more more interested in joking around with each other and singing along to the music than serving customers, there was only one on the till, being distracted by the others. i was trying to get my sandwich toasted and when a staff member eventually toasted it they then walked off and left. i had to eventually ask another person just to get my food. whole experience was ridiculous. would not recommend."
"fairly decent as airport food goes, these pre-made sandwiches gave me some much-needed fresh food in my system before my long flight. prices are routine for airport food, and most importantly, they get you through quickly."
"i needed a quick bite between flights and this was good. it is expensive and busy, but it was more affordable than the other options!"
"no menu board and cant see all food selection at once. you cant go back to select something you may have prefered at the start as queue area too narrow to turn around, and line of people behind y "
we wanted to have a relaxed coffee and sandwich before departing on our vacatio 
"had the chicken, avocado and bacon. didnt finish it, because it was way to salty. so that was a waist of the 7€."
"the line is moving slow, could be quicker if the coffee was made by a separate person. servings on sandwich could be more. seating a bit awkward, distance to the floor too big for normal sized people. the food was good. people friendly."
"good airport lunch. i had a cheese sandwich and strawberry yoghurt smoothie. reasonable prices. easy to purchase food and the shop is a good size, plenty of space to move around. also was very popular at lunchtime. good amount of staff to keep queues down. please note, food is kept out without individual wrapping."
"i stopped at this store when i returned from cardiff to narita via amsterdam. i paid about jpy 2,400 with a smoothie, a croissant, a salad and a evian. this quality is only worth at the most about jpy 1,500 in japan."
"i was at schiphol airport on boxing day and was looking forward to apple pie with whipped cream which is a typical dutch treat. we found that we could not find a table at this place without rubbish and that was clean. we therefore cleared one table ourselves and got ourselves apple pie . my goodness, this was the worst apple pie ever: a lump of fatty crust and crumble with about 2 apple slices. i wonder if the manager of this place had ever apple pie before in his (dutch?) life. and while we spent 45 minutes here waiting for the departure of our plane, no one bothered to clear tables for other customers. this was not because of lack of staff, but they were too busy chatting. although schiphol airport makes an effort to attract customers and makes this airport as appealing as possible with their recent renovations, the amsterdam bread company is a let down for the airport, especially in such a prominent place (near the famous ‘clock’. such a shame. who is in charge here?"
"food was ok (ham croissant) service was ok, stand in line to order, and the people behind the counter were very nice. getting hot tea was not real easy but we did it. seating early in the morning was a little bit if a challenge."
"really, there is no decent place in schiphol anymore where you can grab a good pastry or anything. sadly, starbucks probably has the best croissants these days. schiphol should look at zurick airport - the swiss have the quality food covered. in schiphol, despair - including this outlet. mediocracy central, at airport prices"
this is one of the most visible and accessible eateries at schipol and as such it does an ok job serving bread-based fare to travellers who frankly are not exactly spoilt for choi 
"prices were fair, fortunately they werent crazy busy due to the time (8-11 a "

"there is a decent variety of sandwiches and other pastries. there also appears to be coffee and the like available, but i stuck with the juices and water. plenty of variety there, as well as items for purchase. the food is generally priced for what one might expect for airport food. the juices were quite good, but the other baked items did not seem to have much taste. "
past this place every week and liked the look of it. as i walked in a picked up a bottle of evian and then almost dropped it. 3.35 €. come on its only wate 
"living my life for thirty years ,now suddenly find myself being misgendered by two staff  either this company are transphobic of there is lack of staff training wont be going there again  found it very offensive"
"open after everything else seems to have closed - so it gets points for that of course. the only eating out option if you are at yotelair. nice selection of beers, wine, etc - but selection of hot food was very limited and very pastry driven. "
"bought a pizza which was rock hard like dried bread and after i took it back i chose a sandwitch instead which, most likely, was sitting there for hours. did not complain again as it wouldnt go anywhere, had to depart anyway. on the fair side, if it was fresh, it would be a tasty sandwitch but again, as often happens in airports, too expensive for what you are getting."
popped in here while travelling (obviously) and i spotted treasure! their macarons (weird name) are actually amazingly coconuty coconut biscuits. freshly crunchy on the outside and gently gooey moist on the inside (but fully cooked)! only slightly sweet but easy to munch two at a sitting. a little piece of heaven on earth. 🙂🙂
"they serve decent coffee and a nice choice of sandwiches. on the expensive side of course, but what did you expect at the airport? ;-)"
"ordered two sandwiches here before a flight. stale bread on a piece of cardboard. postmix coke with no fizz for €3,50. and a plastic muffin. tables were not clean anywhere. never again."
"this is a nice, modern clean place in the airport, service and food were ok and prices the usual too high because it is an airport"
"this must be the dirtiest place in the whole airport, teenagers working a side j "
"nothing special. however, the coffee and the croissants are quite good. if you just need a bite try it."

"i bought tea, sandwich, and a chocolate bar here. it was all well priced and tasted good.   the store has more than food. i bought make-up here.   no complaints."
just went there today and i think i never had such bad service before. i have ordered a sandwich and a glass of water and the waiter comes back with my food and a tiny (already open) bottle of water. i told that i just wanted a glass and after he left everything and already starting to walk back he said and i quote here “sorry the water from the tap is very bad here” without even leaving me the chance to arg 
"airport was busy and this place looked a little quieter. put my order in (chicken satay and glass of wine). after an age i checked on my order, my wine hadnt been put through and the food would be a while. eventually wine turned up. an age later my food arrived after being offered to two other tables. wish it hadnt served better looking food to my dog. was some talk of a free wine but as i write the head waitress is arguing against this. unbelievable really, avoid"
"***avoid this restaurant*** went 01/12 with a few friends. ordered two satay chicken mains and 2 of their hamburgers and some nachos. absolutely awful... chicken satay sauce was a thick disgusting mess with chewy chicken and the wedges seemed like that had been sat for a while as some were solid and others barely warm. the burger were equally as bad, way too overloaded with sauce to make up for the dry beef burger and wedges on them were again bad. the nachos had a enough cheese to cause a small heart attack making them into a solid block which was difficult to eat. very expensive and waitresses didn’t seem at all interested with how the food was. ***avoid this restaurant***"
standard place to eat something at schippol airpo 
"crossroads is a good place to visit after waiting for someone at the arrival hall in schiphol. we had some tea and the famous dutch bitterballen. however, these were not fried in oil but warmed in an oven (afterward we saw that the menu said oven bitterballen so we should have known). they were warm and still soft, and two of them were even to cold to eat. a big disappointment. the tea was nice and hot though."
"a party of 9 of us tried to eat here.... the meals all came at different times, all food was cold, but 2 were too cold to be acceptable and were sent back. we also found plastic in one of the meals! we tried to speak to the manager about it but she was very rude. never had a worse meal/service!"
i am also working in hospitality and i know that it is a challenge to find good staf 
"while a good place for a beer, the food was poor. my burger, which was passable, came with a serving of wedges (listed as french fries on the menu), while my wife had a steak (tough) served with some frozen vegetables that were luke warm and looked unappetising. the service was efficient and reasonably friendly. would look at other options next time."
"one star is even too much .i was waiting there for 10 minutes to be attended but none of the staff came . they were busy chit chatting with each other. i reached the counter to place the order. girls standing there didn’t even greet. they ask me “ what you want to have” in a rude tone. another one rolled her eyes . service was pathetic . they serve the food as if they are doing a favor. most of the time i have seen them looking at customers, whispering to each other and laughing at them . i work in service industry and i understand the body language very well. i ll not suggest this restaurant to anyone . i did find them racist. white people were served first and they look down on other nationalities. i have noticed a staff member was talking to his friend ( was not the restaurant employee)for 15 minutes and i think she gave him some free food while customers who were waiting to pay and eat was ignored.restaurant authorities you can check your cameras. your staff is horrible. if they were working in my company they would have got terminated because rudeness and racism is not tolerated at all."

crossroads is a good place to wait for arriving passengers in the arrival 2 hall. it is next to the arriving passengers and nicer setup while you don’t how long you wait is going to be. other than that it’s a regular cafe not to be remembered afterwards.
restaurant located inside the hote 
we had a dreadful experience at mcdonald’s in the airport. food was freezing cold and when we brought it back they laughed at us. disgraceful experience altogether. even management was not helpful. stay away
waited for ages to be seated with staff actively ignoring us. extremely rude when spoken to. do not go here if you want a nice meal.
"waited for ages at the door to be seated with members of staff walking to and fro past us with no acknowledgement. eventually got a table sat next to 2 other guests, which was a bit odd, but we were grateful for a seat. we were completely ignored after this and had to ask at the bar if we could order food and drinks. our drinks arrived - food was left on the pass for a long time while disorganised members of staff flitted about or stood chatting. our food arrived and the waitress left, i presumed for cutlery but i was wrong. i had to go to the kitchen area to ask for a knife and fork. choice of food on the menu is poor and the food wasnt great but was let down by every other part of the experience. had to ask to pay the bill - over 50 euro for pasta, a burger, a medium beer and a coke."
went in this café for breakfast before my fligh 
"first of all i really do think this restaurant is in violation of eu policy with no mention of allergens in the menu and no information about this when asked. waiter had to check each individual dish with the kitchen. making rhings worse the steak was watery, weak, and seemed microwaved. absolutely not somewhere to eat. the frites was fairly nice though. "
"i decided to skip burger king for het palais! a big mistake as i had the experience of the worst hamburger ever! the meat taste bad and us obviously some industrial chemical cook up! this was a true art of incompetence by this rather nice lookng place.avoid the food, unless you are through a half bottle of vodka at the bar!"
"unwelcoming, unfriendly, rude staff. we were on transit and wanted to sit for coffee on a very busy day at schipol airport, one table was available but without chair, so the waiter told us that we must sit at the bar since this table had no chair. another customer gently offered us a chair that we took to sit at the table. the waiter comes yelling at us that we did not follow his instructions and that we must sit at the bar again although we managed to find a chair. poor sense of hospitality, no proactiveness, 0 customer service!"
the staff is everything but friendly especially the old bold man. i am happy that i didn’t spend my money at that place. please do yourself a favor and start your holiday somewhere else.
horrible servic 
"on the 24th of june at around 19-00, my father, had an unfortunate experience of being subjected to rude behavior by an employee of het paleis bar in terminal 1. the waiter in question without provocation used inappropriate, racially motivated words on my father. i am attaching the photo of the employee in question. please go to another bar if you read this."
"very standard dish, chicken satay, looked like cooked some hours ago and pre-fab. prawn crackers probably made yesterday. fries are better in every other place in the benelux. and this eur 25. my mistake for being hungry and optimistic."
"i was told the food would be 30 minutes, after 1 hour and 15 minutes there was still no sign of my food. however, two tables next to me who came after me had been served their meals. when i asked what was happening i was told there was a mistake in the kitchen and my food would be another 15 minutes. when my food finally did arrive (chicken satay and chips), it was bland and only slightly warm. there was no apology for the delay. when i asked to pay i was ignored and had to ask 3 times. it’s like the staff don’t realise they are working in an airport and people might have somewhere to be. the chicken satay and gin & tonic cost 35€ and there wasn’t even a garnish with the gin. pathetic. wish i had gone to burger king! don’t be fooled by the nice exterior, this place isn’t worth the price or the wait."
"waiting to get seated just got too tiresome, as staff continued to ignore us.. we were directed to the restaurant when the cafe had closed the kitchen at 20.00. for now, not recommendable."
"slow and uninspired service, and gas station level burger. i regret not going to burger king instead. we had to wait for the bill a long time, and then had to get up from the table and pay at the desk to get out. at the same time people were queuing to get inside."
"what an awful place. i came here today with my partner, saw they sold a meatless burger, double checked with the waitress that it was vegan - she assured me it was and told us to take a table. after a short wait we were greeted by a different waiter, so being careful as always i asked him to confirm it was vegan which he did, but then on being asked about the mayonnaise, he responded well i dont know if its vegan or not... so i asked him if they could veganize it and after briefly checking with the chef he confirmed it was not vegan but vegetarian. okay. can you please tell me the vegan options? i asked him, only to be told that this restaurant does not cater for vegan "
"very small menu, great service and a perfect place to have a beer and a hamburger meanwhile you wait at the airport. i’ve visited twice when connecting flights."
"the restaurant looks nice from outside, thats why we choose it. but the food and drink selection was a disappointment. they couldnt provide a slice of gluten free bread, or any  milk alternative , or even a cup of decaff coffee for our breakfast."
"went here for lunch and ordered the club sandwich without tomato. when i got the sandwich i could straight away spot a massive tomato glaring at me. i told the waiter, who apologized and took it back. she then came back 2 minutes later with what was obviously the same sandwich. on the crust there was gooey tomatoseeds and i found two pieces of tomato still within the sandwich. told the other waiter about it when she asked how everything was. she said she would talk to the waiter in question.. aaand proceeded to never return to our table. we eventually paid at the counter. no discount, no nothing. my gfs 18 euro pasta was mall cafe quality at best (which, to be fair, is expectable at an airport). left the place annoyed and unsatisfied. would not recommend"

busy restaurant where you can sit for a couple of hours while you eat despite reading reviews about poor service it was very good and ive got no complaints. if you wait 2 hours then you need to be more assertive to get attention......youre only one amongst lots. and before you complain try doing the job yourself......and are you always perfect at what you do...all d 
"this was the worst service i have ever received in a restaurant. if the food had been decent, the service would have been bad enough, but unfortunately the food was bad, too. over cooked, dry salmon, pumpkin soup that tasted “off” like it came from a can, a strange white sauce poured heavily over the green beans, and more.

"for a sit down airport restaurant, the service goes beyond poor. we had to fight to place an order, and it was impossible to pay a bill — the staff not only refused, but was not willing to find the right person. there were at least six of us competing to get the server’s attentio "

"we ordered 2 beer and hamburgers waiting for our next flight and it took about 45 minutes for them to first come with one hamburger, then 15 minutes later the second hamburger. still no beer. i told the waitress for the first time about us still not having drinks - we waited a while, nothing happened. i asked another waiter about the drinks, waited. nothing. when we were nearly done with the hamburgers i went upp to them again, and then at last we got 2 beer. in the end noone came even near us, so that we could ask for the bill. had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the 50 euro for everything.

id rather drink here than in the alternative at schipol. they have decent beer and traditional dutch food. its always been quite relaxed. the service here is much more friendly than other airport bars i have visited: staff smile and seem motivated to provide helpful service.

"what can i say: when you want to have a meal at the airport, usually you are quite* in a hurry. this place is totally disorganised, no sense of customer service. we ordered the burger and a chicken sandwich. although the drinks were served immediately we had to threaten to leave after 30 minutes, the only answer that the waiter gave was that everyone was complaining ..it took another 10 or 15 minutes to get our food..since we were close to the kitchen we could see that our food was ready for a while already when the waitress picked it u "
"i was here on two different occasions, and have two very different opinion "
"this restaurant is horrible. this is the first time i stomped out of a restaurant as it has such horrible services. they want us to look for an empty table on our own.. and all tables were apparently reserved. my point is.. if you do not have the capacity or resources, dont expect your customers to be scavenging around for an empty table that can be used. also, before we went into the restaurant, there is this waiter who gave us a racist look. yes we are asians. whats your problem??? stop being racist, move  "
impolite and indifferent waiters. i was waiting for 30 min and was not possible to even order. really very bad behavior.
total lack of understanding of what service means. also i am not too sure the staff realize that they are working on an airport and that people need to take plan 
"the quiche (with spinach) was quite good actually, and there was plenty of parmazan cheese and dressing on the side salad....but i fail to understand why the dressing was on the bottom of the plate and not over the sal "
staff were really rude and didn’t seem bothered about giving them 100+ euros. was waiting 15 minutes to be served and had to ask for a menu followed by waiting another 20 minutes until the waiter didn’t even bother to come and take our order! quite terrible service 
"so, ive been sitting for the las 15 on one of the outside tables waiting for someone to come. as i could see the waiters were busy i went inside and wanted to place the order myself. the barman sent me back to my table kindly letting me know that (quote) we have table service (unquote). so we are leaving. let the barman know my displeasure in no uncertain terms and i didnt get a single word in retur "
total chaos. took forever to take our order. then took forever to deliver the meal. after 40 minutes suddenly they realized the meal we ordered was no longer on stock. waited a further 30 minutes to get another choice. terrible.
well the burger was ok but the fries cold and the service personal is more interested in their mobile phones than serving the guests. toke 10 minutes to get the bill and pay
"thought to go for a quick bite. ordered a salad and waited for more than 20 min. then they came back that they ran out of salad! ordered something else and they promised to speed it up. after another 25 min still nothing ! asked one the ladies who were serving to check, no feedback at all. went again to another waitress and they forgot again my orde "
this restaurant is located between terminals so it is convenient to pause here if you are going to fly outside of eu. we (like almost everybody else) ordered their classic burgers and beer combo. food was absolutely ok and price level as expecte 
"10 minutes is how long i waited befora i left. i was sitting 5 meters from the bar, but the 5(!) waiters were to busy talking to eachother, so nobody came to get my order."
"from the outside this cafe looks nice and cosy. however, you are in for quite an experience from start to finish, if you get in. they want you to wait at the entrance for seating, which makes sense, but apparently no one is assigned to seating, so you can wait forever before you get the attention of staff. once seated it is another trick to again get the attention of staff to order, and once this has been achieved food takes a while to arrive. the menu is ok, but nothing spectacular. having finished your meal you will again have to work miracles to get the attention of staff to pay, and if you are paying by credit card you will be asked to go to the bar counter anyway, so you might as well make your way there to start with, and see if you can get the attention of anyone there. all in all not a good experience, and a little sad, as the location and atmosphere could make this a great experience with a little coordination and enhanced service from staff."
"the service is really shockingly slow and poor. i waited for 30 minutes to place my order. drinks never arrived. food arrived about 30 minutes later. nearly missed my flight on a 90 minute connection. food was passable, but not great - not good enough for the pain of the service. i travel through schiphol a lot, but will never go back. "
i was waiting more than 30 min before a waiter came to me for taking the order. at an airport where the people are in hurry before the have their flight this is a no- 
"i visited on a monday around 1:00 pm. while it was a little busy, there were pleanty empty seats in the house. i sat at a table that needed to be cleaned off from previous customer. perhaps they cleaned it after i left, but they sure did not while i was ther "
"very unpolite and unprofessional service. discussion mutually, being unpolite when serving. i will never come near this place."
two years ago they served ok food. now the best they serve is x-tra cold heinek 
"they tried to cheat with the wine . we ordered a bottle of wine which they brought already opened and explained how that was normal course . after we insisted they quickly exchanged for an unopened wine which was still overpriced ( 12 eur retail vs 65 at the restaurant ) . the burgers were with frozen beef, the chicken caesar was with smoked precooked supermarket chicken . this place is fully unacceptable for the standard of amsterdam airport . "
"waiting 45 minutes for serving. everytime we approach the staff, they say please wait a minute ill be right with you."
i have written quite some reviews of this place. that is because i return here once a while since i travel a lot from this airport. review score varied in the past with a single uplift once where i had the impression management paid notice of my suggestio 
"45min waitingtime. two of us got their food, the third burger was forgotten and i had to order something else. disaster!"
"airport restaurant only has one main goal: be fast. most of the people cannot wait 40 minutes to be seated when you have 20 free tables and 50 minutes for a salad. great job, you did it."
"a complete horror show. staff were clueless, ignorant and not interested.  shambles of a place. every customer was very frustrated. avoid. i feel sick....."
"the only place that comes close to this restaurant in originality is probably murphys, still het paleis has been an icon of the departures area since 2004. its a scaled down replica of samuel sarphatis 1950s palace for folk art. decor is art deco with lots of wood, cast iron and a gigantic brewers kettle up on the first floor. coke goes for € 3,50, beer for 5, soup 8,50 and a plate of food around 20. when i visited last, service was quite ok, even if the place was packed."
we usually eat at het paleis when we travel from schiphol and the food is pretty decen 
"it seems that i was not the first. went to the bar counter and stood there for 5mins waiting to be served, with 5 staff members inside and around the bar. decide to face one of them, who told me that i could not be served at the bar (after 3 persons took their drinks, seating around the bar counter). i have asked to talk with the manager, all of them answered, “there are no manager”. asked for the complaint book, there was no book either. this people just doesn’t care, people are just keep coming in. my complaint will follow to the netherlands and airport authorities. concerning the ones reading this review... good luck!"
pretty good restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and very nice service.i like it and i keep going .
"the staff are not interested in doing their job. we had to find the menus ourselves, and left after 30 minutes without them even taking our order."
"i had a nice asian chicken, but the waitor was not so interested in his customers. perhaps a how to treat your customer-workshop would be useful...?!"
thought this place looked quite nice from the outside but should have realised it was a shocker when i saw filthy tables and staff just wandering by the queue of people at the doo 
"been here several times. interiör a mixturen between belle epoque and an irish pub. usually quite fast service, however oftentimes (as most service personer on schiphol) indifferent. food ok bit nothing more."
"we wanted to have meal at a restaurant at schiphol with real table service, which is not very easy to find. the place at first sight looks inviting, and so does the menu, but as has already been mentioned by previous reviewers, service is pretty bad. it took ages for someone to notice us, the waitresses were less than pro-active and more interested in chatting to each other than serving customers. the food in itself was fine, as were the drinks, but overpriced. better management of staff is strongly advised, but as all the catering options at schiphol are run by the same company and therefore monopolised, there is probably little motivation to improve."
"youll be deluded. even in non-peak hours theyll let you down. slow, unfriendly service and delusional food (untrue to description)."
"the black coffee was fine and the espresso was not the best, a bit acidic. the seating was fine, less crowded as at starbucks. friendly staff."
"the bread was far to hard to cut through with the butter knife. tasteless and no gravy or sauce in the burger. ketchup and mayo was presented next to the plate, then you had to build your burger yourse "
my flight with klm got delayed and i received on the klm app one voucher of 10 euros value. i picked some snacks and when i showed the app voucher on my phone they did not accept unless it was paper printed. i left the stuff there. 28.02.2018 16:14
this is not meat ! mcdonalds is better !!  french fries not good either.   only the beer is ok.  far too expensive for what it is.   nice situation thats all...
"this place is very strange. you wait forever for service, but some people are evidently fine with that. the staff are quite abrupt when they do finally notice you, and they are not particularly rushed. looking around though you feel that you might be the only person with a flight to catch, as plenty of people are smiling, drinking and chatti "

"the service and food was so bad, i downloaded tripadvisor, created a new account and made my first comment here just so i can tell you all how bad this place i "
"not a good choice. they were very busy, so i felt like i am annoying them with my questions. long waiting time for baverege, but fast food delivery. the burger i had was good teste except for being totatally killed by overcooking... will not go again"
"early bfst when going on a family vacation?? 6,95€ for a simple take away sandwich!!!! absolutely unaccepatable"
the service here could be significantly better here. so could the food. at best it is boring snacks - nothing more  on the positive side the het paleis is placed centrally in schiphol airport.
"pricey place, found a hair in my food, pointed it out to waitress who took my plate away and never returned with an explanation. later went to pay and they charged the full amount saying the hair i found was from an artichoke even though no artichoke was on the plate. best to avoid. "
"sandwiches and coffee before boarding a flight. 45 euro for 4 sandwiches and 4 drinks .. is overpriced, especially if the coffee is not good. went to neighbor starbucks for a good dopio afterwards."
been here twice or three time on business transfers. ( not always my choice). the food is quite alright. i had the dutch burger (without bread...coeliac). they were happy to modify the meal for my gluten requirements so that is ni 
"nice service, food is ok (we had some snacks before our flight), drinks ok (a standard dutch pub measure.) beers fresh from the barrel. but prices are a real rip-off. for a ketel1, where you pay in a normal pub between 2 and 3 euro, 8.50 was charged. for the dutch delecacy bitterballen we paid 7 euro for a portion of six whilst in normal pubs you pay between 4 and 5 euro. a 3 for the pub but a 1 for the rip-off"
"we were changing planes in amsterdam and have used this place before. the food and service were always good. we arrived there with around 55 minutes before having to go to the gate for the next plane, ordered soup and sandwiches and a couple of beer "
"people working here really hate their job. if not, they do a good job of acting. don’t be surprised to be forever waiting at your table because waiter will never look at you. you need to ‘grab’ a waiter for servic "
"we came here for a cappuccino and were sitting outside. after some time without service we went inside to order and the staff was very rude. one waiter told us to order at the bar and at the bar they told us to order at the waiter. the waiter thenbtold us he would make a round through the bar and would serve us very last. finally after 30+ minutes another waiter served the cappuccino by almost throwing them on the table. very bad service, do not go here. horrible place!"
"airport restaurants are airport restaurants. so we dont use them with great expectations. but this one nearly drove us insane with the service. we had to remind our drinks four times, and kindly so. in return we had rude attitude instead of an apology. i urge the owners to train their staff about the basics of etiquette if hey want to keep charging the prices they do."
airport cafes are airport cafes. very seldom a place you return to me. this is no exception: i will not return. overpriced caesar salad and a sloppy served white beer. service quite nonchalant.
"this is one of the best places to eat. you can read my many reviews as i am a frequent guest. the only problem most of the staff suffer from is arrogance and lack of real customer service. the typical waiter looks away from anyone so you need to stand up and get attention if you want to order. typical unfriendly posture, hating the job or simply no education in hospitality at all. i have been here over 20 times now and must say this is the core problem of the staff; no hospitality. they are there to make their hours and unluckily serve you when they feel like it. nothing wrong with the food; just with the people serving  "
"i was recently departing schiphol and wanted to try a new restaurant, and when i walked past the striking two-story building-within-a-building of the grand cafe het paleis, i thought it would be a good choice. after nearly a 10-minute wait to be seated, i was ushered to a dirty table by a server who promptly disappeared. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and, when i asked politely, gave me a menu. i ordered a eur 6 belgian trippel and the dutch burger, a 180g beef patty with gouda and bacon. although the menu doesnt mention it, the burger comes with fries. the food arrived in about 15 minutes and was delicious. once i finished eating, i waited another 15 minutes or so for my check. the food was quite good, and the hardwood, glass, and brass decor of the bar is pleasant to look at. however, the service was slow even by european standards, so i wont be going back."
really slow service. we had to wait for 20 min for two salads. the tables were not cleaned and the service looked really unhappy with their job. not coming back.
"food was ok but we had to wait 15 minutes and call 4 times the waiters to order our meal. actually i had to go myself to call one of them to fibally get attention. even after the order they left the table dirty from previous customers and i asked one of the waiters to clean it up. no follow up, so i asked again another one who answer that she did not have anything to use to clean it and it was not her job and suggested me to ask another one. therefore for the second time i had to get up and go asking to clean the table. when they finally delivered the food the table was still dirty and the waiter started putting down our plates on the dirty table. i told him i would not have eaten my food on a disgusting table with glasses and food from previous customers and after another careless comment and simile from the waiter, he finally cleaned it "
it was not that busy and apparently they couldnt accept more people in the restaurant! i find that really disappointing since it is the only real restaurant to eat at schiphol... maybe we could try next time.
"went there for dinner. many tables free, but no one care to clean them. no waitres no hostess to guide you to a table. when asking where to sit; choose any table  but the case was no clean tables. aprroaching the staff was disappointin "

"beautifully decorated buzzy place, after 10 minutes you forget you are actually at the airport.  after 30 minutes (with no food) the thought of catching a flight comes back to your mind.  after 45 mins you want to fly home.  shame"
"looking at the same menu as 10 years back, there is a limit to how many times you think chicken satay is exciting. but really there is a huge lack of good dining options at schiphol."
"according to the airport information desk, this is the only sit-down restaurant in the main terminal of the airport.  it was not overly cramped, the food was pretty good, and the price was acceptable by airport menu standards."
i was there looking for a lunch when i was waiting for my transit flight back to hk. my husband and i walked in the restaurant a waitress asked 
queues too long for average food and snotty waitresses who think they are goddesses who have the power of life and death
"busy place in the heart of ams airport, where i usually have dinner before flying back home with a late flight. staf is really welcoming, and there is a variety of meals for you to chose from, from light finger foods to full size burgers."
"i wanted to go to a proper restaurant in the amsterdam airport so i came across this one that looked decent. i ordered the spicy coconut soup, along with bread. oh my! the soup was very cold when it arrived. and the spice level was non existent! it should not be advertised as spicy when there is honestly no spice whatsoever. i was actually confused about thi "
"good service, quick and friendly. good standard pretty good for an airport . as always for captive audience pretty pricey, but if the food is ok you dont mind too much. this restaurant fits purpose and as better than most."
"supposedly table service, dont be fooled. ignored for the first 15 mins and no the place was not busy, and quite a noisy place with echo and a tad cold. i ordered satay, which was dry and stale along with the fries. there was no love to be found in the food at all, they are not thinking about your next visit. definitely overpriced for the quality. will not return."
"last dinner in the netherlands for this time. an ok ribeye, a good tiramisu, a good bottle of rioja matching the ribeye perfectly. to end wit "
"ordered a plain rib-eye steak medium +. the food came after a long time of waiting, and it turned out they had brought the wrong order. i pointed this out and told that i had ordered something else. then i get a steak that is raw and cold, which i again explain is not okay. after an eye rolling they tried again after a long time of waiting. i ended up with a bad and tastelessly overcooked steak and side dishes and vegatables melted completely. it appears theyve put everything in the oven for re-heating. (at this point i realized this, since the plate was burning hot!) poor service and food, overly priced! left with the decision that im not coming here again for sure. ps. im a former chef and a waiter, trust me on this one."
i had a caesar salad and the satay chicken skewer

"stopped for a meal before our flight, but might as well not hav "
"not exactly grand rather big and spacious self service place, you wont have to wait to be seated. popular and always busy, just opposite security checks, yet the food is fresh and plentiful."
we had beers here waiting for a connection. the food seemed quite good and primarily dutch. beers are ok in that you get more choice than just heineken. it has a nice atmosphere and looks different to the usual airport bar.
"airports are often a challenge when you want to eat something proper, still have some time left and not granted access to the lounges. you often have the fast food places, bars with bar food, sandwich counters and such. so yes it is nice to be able to sit in a bit more restaurant type grand cafe where there are waiters to help you. then at least you dont have to carry your food tray in one hand and your lugage in the other, which is often not practical when you travel alone. this place would suit you. staff is friendly, bit clumpsy in my case. food came quick. yet the quality is compared to the price not in balance. its too expensive. the flavour is average and you can make it yourself at home as well. even the taste was of product you buy at your local supermarket. why 20 euro almost for a chicken sate with pre fabricated tasting rice. and almost 8 euros for a small glass of wine? it is not a premium place, the airport prices again. unfortunate. i picked 3 stars as rating where it should be 2,5. convenience yes, quality no. "
the food and service were o 
"i pass through schiphol frequently and its hard to find somewhere to kill time and relax over food in the airport. this place is not inviting - crowded, noisy and with cramped tables. but surprisingly the food was ok - generous, tasty and comforting chicken satay. and the service was civil and quick enough. what a horrible place to work as humanity surges in and out, either bored witless or frantically rushed. i think the staff do pretty well considering. for an airport its better than cdg paris but not as good as lhr t5 london."
"nothing to complaint, but those airport restaurants always create this nonsense stress feeling. difficult to enjoy. they are probably trying to rotate the tables too fast. too many tables. too much noice. service just ok. you are a number, not a customer."
"we have tried it several times because it is a restaurant on airport schiphol where there is service. but that is just the problem: the service is sooooo slow. when tou ask about it, the utterly uninspired staff simply says that it is normal to wait 45 minutes for a simple sandwich. with no regret whatsoeve "
"not only they did not clean our table, but we had to order 3 times. we did not get glasses for our water. the staff was incompetent and lost - everyone saying someone else would serve us. we wait for the food. and we still were seen as inconvenient because we dared to complain."
"cant say that id eat here again. i was left standing by the entrance for a minute or so before i decided to simply find myself a vacant table. plenty of waiters saw me, but none of them bothered to acknowledge my presence and help me to find a tabl "
"look nice from the outside. a little bit noisy with music and bad acoustics. got a ride year which the cook seems to have cooked instead of fried. bad quality meat with another of fat (even for a rib eye). the vegetables were lousy, however the mashed potatoes was good. there were oot of ice for the dessert at 5pm! the servants were a little bit slow but nice and friendly. not a place i will visit again"
"where in the universe does fast and attentive service matter more than anywhere else? yes, on an airpor "
schiphol airport does not have that many places to go for good food. this grand cafe offers very decent food. that is simply the reason why i go here. i frequently visit this place when i travel outbound at lunch ti 
"only restaurant we ever go to at schiphol. waiters are friendly and the food is ok! its hot and tastes good. seriously, they make the best bitterballen ever eaten at an airport."
"ok place, but typically airport café with nice food but double or even triple price. it hurts to pay 3,15€ for a small bottle of mineral water, when 1l in the super market costs 0,65€. good offer of sandwiches and friendly staff."
went in to get a burger with chips and a co 
"average food at an above average price, although to be expected in an airport. unfortunately the service was abysmal, 45 minutes to order, the order wrong, and no attempt to ask whether it was right. on making a complaint, no attempt to address the issue. i was left with the impression that it didnt matter, since im unlikely to return anyway. "
"my plane was delayed by several hours, and was prowling the terminal looking for a place to wait/relax/eat. of the many eating choices at the terminal het paleis was by far the best. great ambience, food and drink. prices ok, except for the beer which was expensive. "
"i arrive on saturday during lunch time at grand cafe restaurant. during this time, waiters are supposed to run everywhere and be busy. as i will have a long flight, i decide to have a good lunch and i always wanted to go to grand café as i often travel trough schipol airpo "
the worst burger at the highest price (20€) and with the slowest service (50 mins). very nice job. just because its in the airport and people come and go... if this kind of sub specie of restaurant was in any town of the world the number of clients would be zero. 
rude waiters with an attitude problem. slow service. i will have a beer elsewhere next time. i suggest other do that same.
food was ok. service was slow for an airport restaurant. waiter rude. but less stressed than food court. probably better to eat land side.
had dinner with friends. service was efficient and the food tasted good. the ribeye steak was well prepared and tender. dish lacked a good sous.
was asked to take a table. the waitress too ages to arrive by which time it was too late to order.  on top of that almost all the other places to eat were closing and wouldnt let us in. appalling.
more than ok if you adjust your expectations to the environment where youre in. service was fast and friendly. sufficent choice for a wide public.even the setting is ok and makes you forget youre only at an airport.
the restaurant is roomy and the interior of the restaurant is much above averag 
"this looked like a nice restaurant, but admittedly not particular impressive. the service was slow (the waiters simply had to much to do), the food the usual dutch style food without to much taste. we thought we had plenty of time but a the end we did not as we waited an unusual long time for the food from the kitchen. doubtful i will be back."
"as soon as we stepped foot in the cafe the staff were instantly rude as we asked if they had english menus. when we was ready to be served the lady completely ignored us. slow service for drinks. once our order arrived it wasnt pleasant for the eyes. both our dinners were cold and dont taste very nice. unfortunately we had to pay for food we didnt eat! not impressed!! over priced, rude, horrible place.. dont go !!!! "
"second time through the airport and thought we would try something different from our prior stop. our breakfast meals were average at best. it was quite a bit more expensive than the mediterranean sandwich shop next door. what it did offer was a more private dining experience. if you have the time to sit around for a while you might enjoy it better than next door, otherwise i would stick with the mediterranean place. "
"food nothing special, but could have worked for hungry tummies if it wasnt for the extremely poor service. all waitresses pouted and were not interested in our orders. when orders were delivered some of the sides were missing and they found it sooo annoying to go get it that they lied and said they didnt have any (other waitress supplied later at our request). would not recommend and will not return."
"if i have a stop over at schiphol with a connection to an eu city, i like to stop for a broodje kroket at  het paleis. the service is not always great, the food maybe not what you want/ like as an international traveller, but as a dutchman its like coming home, kroket & beer. decent breakfast as well. last time, august 16, i got good service. but again nothing compared to us standards, unfortunately. ( dutch people: it is the last ( or first) resort) to eat kroketten or bitterballen once you passed customs. i dont think there is a place to order this in the international area at schiphol. cheers and enjoy"
"went here for food before flying home and left most of my food.on the plate. i got ham and cheese.melt with chips. chips were cold and tasteless and toastie seemed dry. my boyfriend enjoyed his bitterballen. waiter wasnt very friendly.and threw our.cutlery at us, wasnt impressed.with this.place at all. "
"we have had good and poor experiences at this restaurant, it all seems to boil down to the waite "
cold food. overpriced. how can you serve cold chips or cold toasts ?  better go to starbuck and buy a muffin with coffe....
was travelling through schiphol a few weeks back and was delayed for a few hours so ate at the grand cafe. the staff were very warm and friendly and offered advice on the specials etc and the restaurant was extremely busy however every customer got 100% attention. the food was served quickly and was nice and tasty and if i am stuck in schiphol again i will be back.
"abysmal and slow service - their interpretation of caesar salad, by the way, is two lettuce leaves and a pile of cheese and mayonnaise - you would think an airport restaurant would be prompt and attentive but you almost have to trip these waiters as they walk past to get them to stop - if you pay with a credit card, youll have to walk up to the waiter station"
"i cant tell you anything about the cafe/restaurant, because there was no service at all. we waited for about 10 minutes and none of the waiters had time to take our order, even though they saw us sitting and gesturing. i guess we were in no-ones service area. go to bubbles! much better!"
"i did not have the lamb like a previous reviewer but the chicken satay was lifeless with a very salty satay sauce. i also did not appreciate that it has one of the airports smoking areas, an ambiance i would prefer not to have with food. the service however was very professional and friendly and the place had a buzz."
"1 totally disinterested waiter present, engaged with phone, not approachable for simple question. not only me but others aswell"
"i bought two small cheese baguettes, crisps and a bottle of water and it came to 24 euro which was really expensive."
too expensive for what you get. the coffee wasn’t good more like hot milk and the staff couldn’t tell me what was the flat white or the latte.
"everything seemed tasty with pleasant presentation, the ambience was good and spacious  clean and neat. the staff was friendly and served us efficiently. however the prices are way up there. check prices before you buy."
"i saw a mouse on 3 occasions, i reported the matter to the staff in bread and they informed me there were mice everywhere in the airport  - totally unacceptable"
made a mistake in the price... not eager to fix it and gave back the change in 5cents as a vengeance... top management skills there !!!!  in short avoid !!
"i don’t feel the need to add any further details, overpriced and stale. choose anywhere else to avoid disappointment."
"two very average ham paninis on disposable bags, two coffees in paper cups and one small bottle of water with no glass, all for €33! part of this was €6 for an extra shot in each coffee- that is €3 per shot into an already made coffee. also, if you asked for one shot less you did not get a €3 reduction. and to add insult to injury the coffee comes out of a push button machine and tastes crap. in the uk ‘bread’ is slang for money- the name sums them up well. don’t bother eating here."
"departures in schiphol is limiting for coeliacs. i was delighted to see this time that bread has gluten-free options. choice of ham or cheese sandwiches. alongside all of the nice and appetising looking normal sandwiches, the pre-packaged gf sandwiches looked weak. i went for cheese and was more disappointed than first impressions prompted. the bread was nice but a single slice of cheese and nothing else in the sandwich just made it a soggy disappointment. all the more frustrating as you got the bread right. just pure thoughtless not putting a proper filling inside. "
"40 euro for a ceaser salad , packet of crisps, a sandwich, a tea & a coffee! realise airport food is almost always over priced but thats just nuts! food nice and fresh but come on guys....thats just a rip off!!"
"pretty perfunctory offering here when you scrutinise it.....sandwiches are fresh and attractive and cold drinks nicely displayed on crushed ice, other than that rather underwhelming, expensive with somewhat indifferent service. it’s an airport so pretty much what you see is what you get!!"
i stopped here for lunch prior to my flight as it was located just past the exit of security. the selection of products was more limited than i expected but i was able to find a warm filled baguette to eat. the food was expensive but i had come to expect that in an airport (10 euros for a baguette and soft drin 
the food was good but staff ignore dirty tables. i was wiping mine and the staff member looked and kept on walking. every table piled with crumbs.
"tried a sandwich with egg mayo, bacon and avocado. it was really tasty and a good snack whilst waiting for my plane."
"the tables and chairs were covered in spills that had clearly been there for a while. when i asked the waiter to clean up, he wasnt sure where to find what he needed. after a long while he emerged with a wet towel. no disinfectant. im not sure hed ever wiped a surface before. he seemed new to the concep "
similar to pret a porter starbucks costa but not quite as good  service was slow and not well organised  panini was plain compared to others
bread as hard as a rock. two stars given as  staff swapped my boyfriends coffee as he accidentally put in pepper instead of sugar
"somewhere to stop for a light bite when in the airport. managed to get breakfast for 4 people for less than 40euros. the sandwiches at ok, nothing special. a nice cup of black coffee"
thought it would be good for a quick sandwich whilst passing through the airpo 
"waiting for our flight i purchased a coffee and cake, nothing special, food a bit bland, then i tried the fresh orange which was a bit tarty instead of the usual sweet.  needs market research to improve, ok if in a hurry though."
not worth going to. its a very busy place but didnt find the food good at all. nothing special. would have rather gone to mcdonalds.
i was very disappointed with the service at bread! the coke which i purchased was overpriced and had more water pumping into it than actual coke. also the hot chocolate we were given was just an empty cup with a sachet in it which was very weak and was not worth the money as it was very bland and felt like a low budget product.
"rude staff member , unhelpful , i would not  spend my hard earned money at this establishment again , i would go to the many other eating place where the staff treat you like a person and not an inconvenience ,"
"whilst i appreciate that 8am on a monday morning is rush hour, there is no excuse to put the slowest server on the tills and then not do anything about  "
"the fact that youre in amsterdam doesnt make a difference. if youre not picky about your food sitting out on the counter, or have a delicate palate, then this is an ok place to grab a bit "
"this place is okay for a quick bite, just dont expect great taste or reasonable prices! we had two glasses of orange juice, a caprese baguette, and a croissant. the orange juice was fresh and lovely and the only saving grace, because the bill certainly wasnt!"
"by far, this was the worst piece of pizza ive ever eaten.  it had absolutely no taste.  the tuna fish sandwich was just as bad.  try some other place in the airport to eat!"
"small bacon & egg sub - €6.25, 2 x juices - €11.50, small bottle of water €3.15. are your eyes watering? yes, its overcharging time at schiphzl airport! average fast food at top restaurant pric "
"youre flying from terminal h at schiphol - theres little to choose from in terms of food. the selection at bread looked tired, wilted or just over-cooked. the only item that was enjoyable was the green smoothy which was a blend of vegetables. i will give bread a miss on the next time through schiphol."
picked this place for breakfast from among the many choices at schiph 
classic overpriced airport fare. tastes okay. got two sandwiches and soft drinks for eur20. wont rush back any time soon.
had breakfast just now. simple bread preparations . nothing to shout about. no fancy ingredients. good choices of juices. vegetarian options available.

"no good for people having bread diet... plenty of panini, sandwich, toast, pizza kind of things... fresh juices are also available.."
ideal for a sandwich or snack but they dont appear to have enough staff to clear the tables when the place is busy
"schiphol airport is currently undergoing refurbishment work, so some restaurants have closed/relocated. looking for somewhere with space, i came across bread downstairs in lounge 3. as its name suggests, it specialises in bread - sandwiches, paninis and pizza. ingredients were fresh, but there was a wait to pay, tables werent cleared and the cutlery bins were not replenished. however when i asked staff for cutlery, they were quick to fetch it. you can access schiphol free wifi here."
"yes, they serve bread at bread!. nice, gimmicky decor. our paninis were okay, almost tasty. the plates were weird, gimmicky. all in all we might grab a panini here again. the service/checkout was kind of slow, but on a trip with layovers, who really cares..."
"the food was good, with quick service. but when i asked for more knives and forks - you need a metal one for pizza - i was waved to a second location. there were none there either."
"if you really have to eat at schiphol airport this is one of the best choices. nice sandwiches, pizza slices and panninis."
absolutely disgusting service. i 
"after eating my maceral sandwich, which was very nice, i noticed two mice running around under the tables. its absolutely disgusting and unhygenic. when i complained the staff seemed to know about the mice. i would not eat there again, who knows what has been running around all over the food?"
seafood restaurant in an airport before security. we were staying in a hotel near by and decided to try this place. it is fine. i ordered wrong and didnt enjoy my meal. my husband got the fish and chips and that was good. tables are bar height. staff was friendly. prices are fair for seafood in an airport. we would eat here again.
"great location in the plaza, near the front windows.  selection of fried and fresh seafood.  tasty and quick.  not a lot of space to sit, just takeaway and find a seat."
"i ordered a fish main course with a bottle of water and one espresso. the waiter prepared immediately the espresso before preparing the main course. when i noticed that i would have wanted to have the coffee after eating the fish, she just replied: “oh, sorry”, laughing, and without offering to prepare another at the right moment, unbelievable behaviour. quality of food horrible. i’ll remember this name next time i’ll travel to schiphol just in order to make the mistake to go there again."
"i always eat here when passing through schiphol, however on my latest trip i witnessed some disturbing hygience practices, namely a staff member emptying the bin with the food hygiene gloves still on, these werent changed before going back behind the counter to serve. they also seem to handle money with the gloved hands, why they dont have one gloved hand (the food hand) and one un-gloved hand (the money hand) and regularly wash their hands.? ive seen this in the uk too. people are generally unthinking and disgusting."
"not exactly the best seafood restaurant in holland. but if you need a raw herring fix as youre transiting through ams airport, then this is the only place in the airport you can get i "
"we had a quick dinner here at schiphol. i ordered fried shrimp with rice. the rice was good, which was rather rare in holland. the shrimp was on average but a bit saltier. in general it was a so-so experience."
"had a seafood salad which was tasty, also the oyster was good but too small than i expected. maybe little bit expensive."
"walking from the railway station to the departure hall we decided to take a dinner at this trendy restaurant. we ordered paella 2/5, ikan bali rice 3/5 and a salad 3/5. the service was friendly and efficient 4/5, the furniture trendy high seats and tables 3/ "
we were here yesterday waiting for our flights departure. decided to try the locals herring fish. the food is good though a bit on the high side. you must try the herring and their fish and chi 
really nothing special but quite ok. they offer a quite wide selection of different seafood dishes.  we tried their lunch box and sushi and it was ok.
"in the mood for some seafood, but tired and not interested in a major dinner, we thought this might have some good, fresh offerings without taking a lot of time. it wasnt bad, but more fast food than specialty spot."
"i stopped here for a quick bite before heading on to amsterdam. the service was slow and i waited for over 20 minutes for the food to be ready, despite there being hardly any costumers. the food was nothing special and the salmon was not quite done. i dont think ill be back, theres plenty of other restaurants around to choose from."
"the food is typically dutch, was cooked fresh and was well present "
"i go here often during business office. the staff is friendly, fish is good and the prices are fair for airport standards. would recommend to go here for an affordable lunch or dinner at the airport."
"the crab spread sub was a-okay wasnt the greatest but thats just my taste. a different sauce would have been nicer. the squid rings were quite oily and they were so thin, not much squid and a lot of batter but portion was big. my boyfriend got cod on its own with no chips and it was quite pricey at almost € "
"too expensive, we bought two small fried fish and paid € 15 for it........ € 7.50 per piece for 6 pieces per tray kibbeling"
"there are a number of food places in the amsterdam airport, but this was different. it is a restaurant specifically aimed at providing fresh seafood. i ordered a homemade salmon sandwich and that was pretty good. i would definitely come here again, however it is definitely too expensive. it really depends if you want seafood so much you would pay for the price they offer!"
"everybody is prepared to pay a bit more at any airport (liminal spaces and all), but at happy seafood the price goes way overboard. we had the so-called big portion of kibbeling (deep-fried battered fish). on the plus side, this is kibbeling made from true cod, rather than the cheaper type of white fish often used. on the minus side, a big portion, which in the rest of the netherlands will get you around 300g of kibbeling, at happy seafood is here at most 150g, perhaps less — but at more than double the price! sometimes you pay for the nice seating, but thats emphatically not the case here: the seating area only has small, high tables with barstools that seem to be designed to get people to move on as quickly as possible. at the risk of ending with a terrible pun: at happy seafood, the foods good, the rest is fishy."
"we ordered an eel roll, packed in a small box with plastic cover. the taste was reasonable because you could taste the smokyness of the eel, but the wrap was too soft and the veggies were all mushy. 2 small rolls were almost 8 euros, which is very expensive."
i walked from airport to avoid eat some “airport food” and following the hotel ranking. i tasted the salmon that was delicious but the servi 
"nice place, pretty good food. watch out for the recommended for two persons menu item. it’s way not enough for two (price is, quantity isn’t) the extra burger was needed to complete the meal."
"in europe tips are not the main portion of income, but tonight, i dinned alone and another stranger from same country sat alone next to me. we struck an engaging conversation. we converged to 1 table and paid our respective bills while finishing our beverages. we were asked to move to the bar bc they needed to seat others waiting. many empty tables around and waiter, balraj asked us to move to bar area. we did and 12 min later…still empty seats. as a diamond with hilton, i may switch to marriott bc of service…or lack there of…"
front of house service was brusque and off hand when we asked to be moved from a very large and noisy group area.  took ages to get out 1st course and even longer for the 2nd course. food was bland. a very impersonal experience.
stayed at the hilton the night before our flight home so decided to have dinner here in the hotel. appetizers and entrees were good but nothing special or outstanding. think we could have had just as good a meal or even better at one of the many restaurants in the airport mall and for less money.

"this restaurant is very interesting place to review because it sits in a classification between being clearly preferred and feature restaurant of an international chain hotel and also, perhaps, it wants to have its own identity. having read some of the other reviews on this site, i was expecting the food to be stronger than it was based on my two opportunities to eat he "
"i ate dinner here earlier this week during a layover at the hilton schiphol airport (this is their on-property restaurant). overall, its a great restaurant with lovely food, a nice atmosphere, and seats where you can watch the chefs/cooks do their thing. id easily increase my rating to 4-5 stars if it werent for our server, niki. i say server because she only visited our table 4 times during the evening; to bring us menus, to re-fill our water, to bring the dessert menu (which we had no interest in given her poor service) and to bring our bill. i will say hats off to the rest of the team, who took our orders and brought our meals, as well as checked on us to ensure all was ok. niki did none of these. she was simply horrendous and if you choose to eat here, avoid sitting in her section."
"the bowery is the upscale restaurant of the schiphol airport hotel. it serves expensive but very good quality lunch and dinner dishes. using high quality and local sustainable ingredients. regrettably during a busy lunch hour it was seriously understaffed leading to the ball being dropped ... cutlery forgotten, food coldish, slow with the bill. atmosphere also a bit unrelaxed with many conference lunch eaters coming and going. staff managed to remain friendly despite the pressures. "
we both went for the asian menu selection. i had the beef and my friend had the sticky chicken both of which were very good. i ordered a bottle of rose - which was very nice but once our glasses were poured the bottle was taken away. it was never topped up unless i requested it from the waiter despite having an empty glass for over 10 minutes. we had almost finished the bottle - about 4cms left in bottom when he took it away and brought us a new bottle. i said i wanted the remainder of our bottle of wine not a new one and he replied that he had thrown it away as they never serve the last drop of wine due to sediment! i have never had this with a bottle of rose. maybe with a red. so i felt we were cheated out of a glass of wine! it’s the principal not the cost. so be aware when ordering wine here. 
as we were stranded passengers we felt slightly segregated from other guests because it was a free service! the food wasn’t great compared to the bar food we also had during our stay! was almost like we had “leftovers” however the food that guests were eating looked amazing as we walked through to our buffet 
"have you ever been to one of those restaurants where you pick up the menu and after scanning and re-scanning it, you think, actually im not really sure i fancy any of this? id just like something simple, easy-to-understand and comfortin "
"had my breakfast here for 5 days. typical same menu every single day. lunch a little variety. really, not impressive at all. the good thing, staff are nice, warm and courteous. "
"the restaurant claims to serve the best burger in town. well.. they dont. if they wanna claim anything, it might be worst burger in town. the burger was hard and rubbery, the tomato and gherkin were almost frozen, the bacon far from crispy and the taste almost chemical. after trying everything separate, it was clear that all products used were far from good. with b-quality its hard to make the best burger. staff was friendly but quite inexperienced. and way too much hassle: unfolding the menu, introducing them selves, asking whether we want the drinks menu on the table or not, the bill in a little tin.... a concept can be nice but this is too much for our taste. we also tried the mushroom croquettes (yuk!), the gyozo and other things and nothing made us very happy. they could do so much better. and with their prices they should do better. "
staff is friendly. food is taste good but a little bit pricey. burger is recommend. please make sure staff is put a right room number on the bill.
food was good but staff attitude poor. at peak times staff tends to be very hectic and forgets many orders if you come with a group of more than 5 people. inattentive and insensitive to customers.
ordered still - gave sparking. ordered medium well - gave rare. but worst - husband ordered seafood bisque - gave some kind of chicken soup instead.... and no takeaway allowed of leftovers if u dont finish - never again 
"whether you dine alone or with a 3 [as i did] it is really comfortable. staff is knowledgeable, wines are tasty and all three starters that we ordered were up to expectation. the main course however was not. the nasi goreng had not enough flavor and was not indonesian enough. too bad, this could be a great dish on the menu. but, there is enough to choose from so hopefully other dishes are more tasteful. for sure a place to return to."
"staff was friendly and welcoming. some issues with the service but nothing serious. food was only average, i honestly was expecting little bit better for the price. pretty standard hotel quality, nothing really wrong with that."
"as other reviewers have noted, service is spotty. it took more than ten minutes to get any drinks on my table. i saw several patrons actually get up from their tables to go ask for their checks. fortunately i brought along something to read. food was ok, but not outstanding. "
"we visited here on a sunday, it was very quiet indeed. now i know wh "
"bright (almost too bright), airy and welcoming restaurant in the schiphol hilton. exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. swift, attentive (tending towards too attentive....this is a fine line guys!) service. ate dinner and breakfast here recently. food beautifully presented. dim sum, excellent. nasi goreng very bland. the prawn (tempura style) was rubbery, cold and undercooked. the coating soggy....bit unfair to raise this now since i didnt complain at the time and allow problem to be rectified, but notice this wasn´t an isolated case. breakfast was very good. appreciated those small touches....coffee brought in large thermos....orange juice served and topped up....one of the lovely staff tempted us with warm pancakes brought to table. may i suggest seating larger groups away from couples? we fled a raucous group of men placed next to us. sorry....do not do loud in a morning."

"the food was good, not exceptional. but very convenient, as i was staying in the hotel and the price of the food was reasonable for a 5 star hotel."
"the hotel is very nice and we were looking forward to an equally nice meal after a very long day of international travel. we arrived at 9pm. the restaurant was not busy, but we had to wait ten minutes for a table. that was our first sign that things would not go well. finally, we were seated at a table that was not dressed. a couple who arrived after us, received menus, water and a greeting from a waiter before us. we waited and waited. nothing. after ten minutes, i called over for a waiter. we received menus and had the table set. we quickly decided on our choices, but again, no waiter. he had disappeared. we waited so long that the couple next to us were served bread and their drinks. there is an open kitchen where we watched a frantic chef fussing over dishes. he was expending so much energy, but it seemed misguided due to the bad service and so few tables to serve. i called over the hostess once again so we could order. she took our ordered and explained that there had been a delayed flight and the restaurant was crunched trying to prepare dinner for the passengers. there was a buffet already set up for the delayed flight. it was a poor excuse. our poor service was due to a disorganized staff and lack of professionalism and experience. surly, an international airport hotel should have well trained staff prepared to serve tired travelers. no one comes to the airport just to eat out. everyone there is traveling, jet lagged and wanting to eat and move on. i ordered miso salmon and my husband ordered a hamburger. my salmon sat under a hot lamp for nearly ten minutes while the chef fussed over stylizing plates. the salmon was overly sweet and over cooked. we were so annoyed by the entire experience we couldnt wait to get out of there. we would stay at the hotel again, but not eat at the restaurant."
ok hotel is ok a la hilton bit far from terminal advertised closer its a serious walk all the way at the e 
average breakfast and dinner. good value for price since breakfast is juts 15 euros and you can have continental buffet and fresh made omelet.
"this place is fine if you are staying in the hotel, but i wouldnt recommend it otherwise. breakfasts here were good with lots of options. service was friendly, if a bit disorganised,"
"the quality of the meals was good. i liked tom kah kai. it was a little bit salty though. steak tartar was excellent. my wife ordered asian wrap, which was not the one she expected. the problem is waitresses. they were very nice, but not efficient and not professional. they socialize each other and do not pay much attention to customers. a lady next to us asked for the dessert menu, but nobody came back to take order for 10 min. not surprisingly she just left. they need to be more trained and the ms ages should watch how they are doing for customers. we did not get bread and some au de voir despite the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine."
"this is the restaurant of the hip and fun schipol airport hilton. the interior is modern and trendy, but for some inexplicable reason the waiting staff are dressed as farme "
"i was taken to my table but then ignored for the next 10mins, until i finally got someones attention to provide me with a menu. why dont they leave a menu with you once you reach the table? the codfish had little flavour but the accompanying bread was delicious. disappointing."
"presentation was nice but the taste was very average. service was friendly and efficient. they are still in the startup, do plenty room to improve."
"the host was friendly, took a long time to get a menu and bead provided was really great as was the butter etc this was the go "
"i was intrigued by the write up about this restaurant, so i asked for a seat where i could watch the kitchen in action. interesting, but didnt see all that much. while steady business, i was most disappointed with poor service. i waited at least 15 minutes for my plate to be cleared and then another 1/2 hour for my server to bring my check! the menu choices are mediocre. the fresh roasted veggies were greasy and underwhelming. would probably take a cab to eat elsewhere next time considering the prices, selection and service. there is an amazing sized hamburger on the menu for the hungry person, though!"
"great food selection on menu, and terrifically cooked. only negative is the very slow wait between courses. fifteen minutes between ordering and soup arriving; then ten minute wait for main course, and then fifteen minute wait to receive dessert (in fact had to remind the staff each time to bring the next course) - all this perhaps because the restaurant (and the hotel itself) are new (opened in december 2015) and still undergoing shake-down."
"we decided to discover bowery for a lunch. the place is nice, with a great decoration and atmosphere. nevertheless the service was a complete disaster! arrogant, unprofessional, more than 40 min to get dishes... bref unacceptable for hilton and a nice moment which turn into a nightmare!"
this really is a pathetic and pretentious place. the worst was the very agressive pushing by the waiter to leave a tip on the credit card. upselling the (good) house wine as if it was something very special was plain silly.
service was mediocre. asked for something light because i was not hungry and got a big heavy slab of mea

especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"

"let me start by saying that possibly the covid times are not making it easier to provide a 1 star michelin experience, but i nevertheless have been to a few lately that didnt have this level of experien "
"we went to this restaurant a few times twenty years ago & didnt think much of it then. we had given it a miss ever since then but decided to go there last week to see whether things have improved. it is a nice, quiet restaurant set in a small shopping street. we had a three-course meal with tea & chocolates at the end. unfortunately, things havent improved very much in the last twenty years. the food was mundane without any wow factor. even if it did not have a michelin star, the food would have been described as ordinary at best - having a michelin star made it that much worse. the service was pleasant & the restaurant was full, so perhaps it was me that didnt like it. there are many restaurants in the area, both with and without michelin stars, which are infinitely better than cheval blanc, in my opinion. it is a great pity, as the restaurant is located near where we live & hence very easy for us to get to, but i think we will have to wait another twenty years to see whether there is any improvement!"
"we had the deschamps chef menu, and we were just disappointed by the whole experience. the creations are (seem) to simple for a restaurant of this level, not exciting at all. there was also this figure that kind of runs the place, he was a bit annoying, we didnt feel very comfortable with him arou "
"lovely dinner, though seated very close together.  menu was nice, good execution, wasn’t wowed we’ve had a lovely dinner, waiters were nice, all was clean."
"we had the 6 course tasting menu, everything was just pretty much ok, nothing spectacular, nothing to remember. i guess prices are fair"
"the food was good, but the restaurant is very noisy (bad accoustic). the room is small and packed with tables, which makes it less cozy. i had a draft on my neck from the air conditioning."
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the saté was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brûlée very good."

"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend €120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.

"very decent lunch platter, very big portions. terrace is nice with shade or sunshine options. service wasn’t the quickest, but overall it was okay."
"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staff’s eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying ‘dat meen je niet!’ she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long she’d like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadn’t made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was ‘oer’ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though i’d ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that he’d promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.

we liked the food here in the past but the last five times weve ordered here we had to call multiple times to see why the food was delayed. on two occasions they had not processed the order. today they also forgot to include the most expensive article in the order and treated us rudely when we asked our money bac

nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
"its as if the staff walk around actively trying to avoid getting into contact with customers. ive waited for 10 minutes, 3 servers walked by and none of them even said as much as hello. ive walked away from their terrace for the second time in a few weeks now. this used to be a fantastic restaurant. good food, good ambiance. sadly, they seem to have slipped.

"the menu is traditional, offers a fairly good selection of dishes. staff is friendly and efficient. although the restaurant is fairly large, the restaurant is divided into smaller sections creating an intimate atmosphere."
"we didnt really want to have dinner at the van der valk hotel but on mondays a lot of restaurants in assen are closed. someone told us the food at the hotel was really okay, which is what made us decide to have dinner the "
in this part of europe hotel restaurants are more interested in giving you a filling meal that is good value for money rather than delighting the senses. meals in the van der valk hotel assen are served in a large charmless room with the window seats commanding views of the motorway and industrial estate but then no one would come here for a culinary adventure or a romantic tryst. 
"after going past most restaurants in town, that were closed, a bank holiday, we finally thought about van der valk. this used to be known for cheap food and large portions, (trucker portions they would be called), but not very fine, dining, just simple good meals, to everyones taste. but since they were a hotel, we were sure they would be open. we went there and the restaurant was nice, entirely newly decorated, well upgraded from the family rooms, it used to look like. also the running stressed students were gone and the staff seemed less temporary and very friendly and professional. the restaurant was full. as we did not have a reservation, we were lead to a side restaurant, which looked like a buffet restaurant, as it had a huge (empty) fixed buffet facility. we ordered, and though the restaurants were all full, it took longer than normal there, but still came in a relatively timely manner. the menu has become more a la mode. we ordered and enjoyed our meal, but all concluded, that it was better they stick to their simple good meals instead of making complicated mixes of different cultures in one plate and nothing really having a nice authentic taste. also gone were the large varieties of vegetables and potatoes : boiled, fried, mash and french fries, and though not ordered the mayonnaise ( a must with chips on a dutch table) was charged separately, which seems odd for a facility like this. prices had also gone up. the décor is nice and i believe this is a good place for a family meal ( with kids), on the move or other reason to have a quick meal, but no longer, an inexpensive one, but then, the netherlands, compared to germany, france, and the uk, is very overprices when it comes to dining out in general, we believe."
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25€, and salad 9.75€. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"we took two burgers on the lunch menu. bad meat, bad bread, almost no salad. non smiling service. not a great place. though it is well located."
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."

food: 3/5 
i asked some vegetarian options among a rubbishy pre set tapas meal. after 45 minutes scouring through random pieces of meat i found 2 meager options. luckily the waiters gave me enough time to find it before being able to serve the next round.
"cafe de zwetsers offers various tapas and many kinds of beer. the all-you-can-eat menu is 21 eur excluding drinks. the tapas are mostly deep fried stuff (shrimps, bitterballen, fish sticks, etc.). however, the vegetarian option are available in the menu as well. the place has very nice ambiance and very attentive staff. our orders were picked up very fast. the waitresses are extremely polite and smili "
"the restaurant has got a nice terrace and plenty of indoor seating. menu is mainly deep-fried food. the actual cheeseburger i got was greasy, tasteless and rather expensive."
"good atmosphere, good service, reservations recommended on friday and saturday. not a bad eating experience, my wife had the pork kabob with ribs, which were good. meats were served on a bed of mashed potatoes with bits of spinach leaf, well presented. meal came with french fries, a salad and another potato dish (not baked). couldn’t quite determine the spice used on the second potato dish, but wasn’t to my liking. a baked, with sour cream and chives, potato would have been better. i had the ribeye, which, unfortunately was not available, but the house was gracious enough to substitute a t- bone at the same price. t-bone was a healthy size, and cooked to my request, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. questioned the waitress and found out that the meats have very little fat content, presumably the reason for being chewy. my recommendation to the cook would be to use a bit of meat tenderizer in the future. also wouldn’t hurt to marinade the steak in either a1 or hp sauce for a few hours for some additional flavor. had i ordered the t-bone at its full price i would have been disappoint "
"we were just the 2 of us, my brother and me. he had the spicy ribs and i had the steak. the steak was fine, it was of good quality but the pepper sauce looked and tasted like it was the kind where you just add water and serve. terrible. the vegetables were virtually non-existent and pretty blan "
"good for dutch standards. its a small restaurant, cozy and intimate for a romantic dinner. they have decent meats and a good menu in general."
"having been here a few times, i was surprised that the restaurant was listed no. 22 of restaurants in emmen when it could be a lot better then that. almost all ingredients are there, but the right recipe has not been found yet. location is not bad, and the place has a very nice feel to it. we were sitting outside in a spacious aria at the front of the restaurant. drinks were served quickly. so, the setting was there. but what was missing ? hmm perhaps that the food was just good, nothing special. meat ( rib roast ) a bit dry, and the tomato soup was almost a diluted pasta sauce. too creamy and cheesy. but all in all, not bad at all. the service was kind and helpful but during dinner they left the table unattended for too long of periods. i guess the place just needs a bit more professionalism. paying a bit more attention to details. taking away used plates quicker, and come by a bit more often to check for drinks. so, could be better, but 22nd is certainly not deserved !"
sorry to say this but the food just was not go 
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
"well, the title says a lot, doesnt it. perhaps im being a bit negative, but after visiting them 3 times i keep getting the feeling that i should not come again. one time i was there i requested that i would not like a scoop of chocolate ice cream in my trio of ice, but rather have an extra vanilla instead.. i was gobsmacked when they told me that i could only order what the menu said !.. ( still cant get my head around that ) last time i had no choice as the other restaurants were fully booked, so we just sat there outside, waiting for someone to come by.. ....... which took a while... and when someone came, we asked for the menu, ............ which never came, so we collected it ourselves. and after reading that for a kids menu under 12 y.o. the child would have to prove it by an id, thats when i stood up and wen "
"the location in the center of emmen is excellent. nice and cosy restaurant. the food is ok, but not special. service is good."
well its okay but not one of the better restaurants in emmen. there are better options for a lower price.
old outdated restaurant with an outdated menu. we were the only ones in the restaurant and when i ordered a double espresso she gave me two espresso on top of eachother. so that isnt professional at all and the prices are way to high for the food and service you get here.
"went there for a drink and a snack. chicken wings were horrible, covered in batter. its oke for a drink but do realise that toilet access is pretty bad, you have to use a steep stairway!"
"we placed an order but we got unfortunately the wrong order (their mistake) after a phone call with not a very friendly man they said they would come back and give the new order once arrived they requested extra payment for the correct order .. so we eventually payed twice, we are very unsatisfied. wouldnt recommend this place to anyone"
"i must say that because i was the only one who did not enjoy my meal, reflects more on me than the hotel. having said that, i had the duck and was not pleased with the taste. i wish there had been more choices on the menu, perhaps some chicken. i also did not like the vegetarian options for my sister, as she cannot eat mushrooms. she had the special which she guessed would be whatever was left in the fridge, as it was the chefs creation - and she was correct. however she enjoyed it. my mother enjoyed her sirloin, and my grandparents enjoyed their food too. so maybe it was just me! the staff was very attentive and helpful, especially with my aging grandfather. i was not left impressed by the menu choices, but otherwise it was a pleasant evening."
more a bar then resturant. had carpaccio which was placed on buttered bread. first time eaten that way and i guess there is a reason. it does not work.
"went there with husb. and littleone for quick dinner. place is enormous. food nothing special for an all you can eat but this makes that there is something for everyone. if you like the all you can eat concept go there. if you don’t, keep away from this place. it is as simple as that."
poor attempt at running a buffet restauran 
"indeed you can choose from a lot of dishes, but the quality of food is below avera "
the restaurant is really spacious and can fit a lot of people inside it. the food is ok but the diversity can be more( in my eyes it just have a bit more dishes than wok). the dessert menu has a lot of choices.
"run by unpleasant people, average food at inflated prices, very hot inside, no ventilation or aircon, chinese production kitchen is not something you want to see, if you want to eat there, it will put you off forever, drinks not included, most staff try hard, but really, there are other similar cheaper places to go, inclusive drinks and a more pleasant environme "
"service is average, but nice. food is average nothing more nothing less. competition would be great for this restaurant i presume. asperges were ok but not really good, fries and wine average, everything is average here. i think they are great for large groups and tourists, for great they really have to make a huge step.

place looks well decorated and compared to the past the long cues are solve 
"the food is not well cooked, very few dishes. last time i ate raw potatoes and a disgusting cake. better eat in another place."
visited la place this afternoon 
"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
"most uninterested, unfriendly and bored ppl i’ve ever encountered in a service establishment! it looks like they have been forced to work he "
this is not a subway wort 
can’t describe the lack of efficiency here. i sat at the table for 1h with my family waiting. what did we order? 4 simple paninis and 2 soups. the amount of people during this hour that decided not to wait and left was impressive (also the trays with drinks brought to empty tables and back into the fridge after being re closed). for our drinks we”only “ needed to wait for 30min. i must say that the food was great. or we were just starvin 
"the croque monsieur was reheated and absolutely dreadful. have been before, but now they have started reheating the food i will never go back"
first of all the menu promised a bread-sommelier to help with the decision on what type of bread would compliment your topping. the only question we got was white or brown and later they came to me that they didn’t even had brown bread. and just fyi at this moment there were 5 tables and 4 waiter 
"the first impression was not so good. despite hardly any guests in the cafe there were many dirty, not cleared tables. also one chair at our table was dirty. as we were hungry, we decided to give it a try. we ordered a full lunch with hot meals and drinks plus tap water for the kids. however, the restaurant refused to serve the tap water and came with small bottles for each of the kids. why is unclear: we were spending enough so why no tap water for kids? why wasting bottles if tap water in holland is superb? we did not get a good answer: only ‘company policy’. the food itself varied from good (salmon, ‘rundvleeskroketten’) to mediocre (pancakes, fish and chips). service was quick. when we paid (unfortunately you cannot pay at the table but need to go to a till) we were very surprised to see that we had to pay €0,50 for ketchup. the fries came with mayo, so why not change for ketchup? in conclusion: not a good experience. will not come back. "
we had fish and chips and chicken saté. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"too much pepper in the burger, fries tasted a bit like they were made with old oil, but the spare ribs were juicy and tender. nice outdoor seating."
"we ate good steaks only we received only one serving of french fries instead of two. some people who were alone received one serving of french fries same portion we received. it was not fair. then we finished our food, the waitress came & we asked why only one portion. i forgot what she said. just like discrimination because we were the only brown people that time. she asked if we wanted another portion of french fries. ah ah... what an excuse!...we were finished already. then she asked!!!the place is good & food to "
i ordered take out 2 rib menus. the ribs were extremely fatty and with a lot of bone splinters. the taste of the meat was fine thoug 
"service was good with friendly staffs. starters such as mushroom with cheese, goat cheese, onion soup and smoked salmon, were excellent, they smelled really good. main dish had a reasonable portion. meat was good. fish was tasty. if you arent in a hurry for dinner, this place can be your choice because it takes a bit time to get food delivered to your table."
"we were with the four of us. we told the restaurant we were going to the theater after dinner. we had two hours planned for dinner but after one and half hour we were still waiting for our main course. we told the waiter we were concerned , but that didnt help much... we did make it in time but it was only just."
"we first ordered drink and then lunch. after seeing most of customers got their food, we asked a staff (there were only 2 staffs) about our food. the staff looked blank and said she did not take our orders. unbelievable!!! she looked into her note and found out it was her. it took in total 45 minutes to get lunch. food was delcious though and restaurant looked cozy though. "
"this place offers a 3 course menu with different options for a good price, eur. 14,50. next to the dinner menu they offer an extensive beverage menu with some nice cocktails. the place itself is very nice and attractive however the employees are not service minded at all. as a customer you have to ask them for a menu, ask them to take your order, ask them to clean the table etc. that is sad seeing how beautiful the place is and the potential it has. you can have a nice time there for dinner and lots of fun drinking after your meal but the service doesnt motivate you."
"service in general was fine, altough one of the guys forgot that i ordered an extra beer. but one of the dishes we ordered totally did not match the menu. it should have tomatoes, bascilicum and ..., but it had totally different vegetables and a bell pepper sauce - which was for sure not mentioned. next to that, the dish was super saulty. so we were nit so happy about the food, we did get a discount when we mentioned it though."
"normal bar, trendy inside, but very poor waitering. more then once i ordered my drinks at the bar which they would bring to the table and then waited more then 20 minutes. the bill is also qwuite often a surprise..."
waited a long time to be served. then waited a long time for my drink. when i ordered my meal and second drink it never showed so i just got up and left. visit lelystad regularly for work but wont go here again.
"the first course consisted of a board to share. cheeses, ham, delicious mushrooms. but who in the kitchen thought of tiny pieces of smoked salmon in a small piece of cold wrap? not tasty at a "
my husband and i thought this would be a nice place to have something to drink. the waitress asked if we had a reservation but it was not a problem and said we choose a table in the back. i sat down and husband went to the toilet. i was waiting to be asked what i wanted to drink. but was totally ignored by several waiters they looked at me and continued talking amongst each other and one them even went to the bar and had audacity to have a drink at the bar. only when my husband returned the waiter came to set the table and take the order. just to make it clear i am dutch-indian origin and my husband is real dutch therefore caucasian. i assume i was not good enough to be recognized as a person and only my husband was as he is white skinned. so sad that that there are still people like this in the world.
"the setting is cool, that is what invited us in but now we know bett "
nice place with lovely views. spacious and bright restaurant with some outside space looking up to a harbou 
"this restaurant is a short walk from batavia outlet. it overlooks lelystad harbour and rather nice both in summer when the terrace is open and in the autum. the waitresses are friendly. it has a modern ambiance. the waitress accidently split the beer which did splatter the jacket. they offered to pay the dru cleaning bill. uitsmiljters were ordered which were fine. unfortunately the menu for lunch is rather small and not much to choose from. the plus point is if you park in the underground parking, they give you a parking card to drive out instead of paying the normal parking fee. definitely better than eating at the outlet,"
"ive been here a couple of times now and i truly believe it is a hit or miss situation here which largely depends on the mood of the staff that day. we popped by today for a latte and a cup of coffee. today wasnt our day, staff was cranky and eager to dismiss us as soon as possible. in addition for the prices i would expect a real latte. this was a machine pumped watered down cup of something that somewhat resembled a latte in taste. hubbys coffee was at least better than sludge he said. so in general if you want to pay too much for a limited menu, crappy service with a nice view then you should pop by de rede. will we go again? oh probably as location is ideal. ps dont even bother asking if any of their coffee drinks can be altered slightly, it all comes pre-made in a machine."
the food was nothing special. only the sateh was pretty good. waiters forgetfing the drinks and took almost 30 minutes before someone came for ordering the food. it was not very busy.
"the second rede we tried after rede in dronten. its location is nice, with view of water and boats. food is good as usual. the service is great. we always have good time at de rede."
"i very rarely write negative review but this time, i can’t resi "
"good service, mediocre lunch offering, better dinner options. nice view over the marina. we were there for lunch and it was rather quiet but i can imagine it is a vibrant place at night when all people from the boats come in for dinner & drinks. should be nice!"
we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.

terrible service. rude with no smile. didn’t allow us to order take out from the restaurant or even to see a menu.  charge money for using the restroom ‘  no vegetarian options.
"this is not fine dining but you can get a decent meal! i had a steak which was oke, the vegetables and potatoes were nice. one of the better highway restaurants that i have been in. they had a busy night, i could tell, but were still quick and friendly. "
"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajé."
i visited this restaurant while staying in lelystad. i had some mixed feelings on my vis 
this harbor restaurant is a bit out of the way but the tasty dishes are a good reason for the 5 min drive out of the city centre. the interior is surprisingly modern and cozy. the staff is friendly but needs some more experience.
an averadge restaurant but excellent for having a drink and/of as snack while staying the day on the nearby beach
"what can i say about this chain restaurant?, all the same concept. one is bigger than the other. here, they have a playground for the kids, big terrace. we had a good veggie burger for the lunch."
"what can you say that has not been said before. the same awful food in the same awful surroundings. use only in desperation - better quality food can be bought at either of the two petrol stations just along the road. better still, continue on the a6 direction amsterdam for just 5 minutes and enjoy a break at haje."
honestly i have been to better. the burgers are probably the worst i have had in a long time but hey at least it is food

"we went to this place for what we thought would be a quick meal. we ended up leaving without having our bite to eat. the cook seemed totally lost! he would look at the orders and just read them over and over again until finally he seemed to understand what he needed to do. and the place wasnt crowded or anything. many people were just having coffee. we dont know if the food is any good, but service is terrible!!!"
"ok pancakes after visiting the batavia ship, or shopping. the service could be better (forgot about one of the dishes), but the pancakes were ok overall, with interesting topping choices. combines an ice cream shop."

"nice place for lunch or dinner with family and friends. rather good choice of menu and drinken, game room for children. friendly personnel and fast service (however it was rather busy on saturday evening)."
"just outside of batavia stad is this restaurant with a terrace shielded of from the wind, great! food is ok, but not really special. the menu lacks imagination. service is ok, but waitresses prefer to talk with each other instead of looking at the customers"
"the place looks nice but dirty, there were spiderweb everywhere. the service is very bad, we waited long time for our drinks and ofcourse for the dishes too. after we waited around one hour for a lasagna and a caeser salad, we asked the waiter if he can prepare the food for take away. we received a very burned lasagna and a so called caeser salad wich was not caeser at all. we recommend to avoid the place!"
"the food here is fine, and not long waiting time. it is located outside of the mall, so it is fairly relaxed and quiet, which is nice."
"it is a nice place to sit and rest your legs while shopping. service was fast when we ordered lunch and drink. food was good. however, staffs could pay more attention to customers because we tried to order more drink and nobody really looked at us."
"terrible place, ive ordered a sirloin steak without butter. the first time they brought this dish to my friend, although he asked for a ribeye steak and the waiter told him explicitly that this is his dish. after the waiter understood he made a mistake, he ordered a new sirloin dish and brought it with butter although it was explicitly requested without. to summarize do not get near this place. horrible food with bad service from unprofessional team."
"had a coffee here as a cycle trip stop. service ok, drink fine, nothing special, nothing wrong here."
"liked watching people and the town hall from the terrace, price/quality was just ok, nothing special"
terrible service. arrived with my family. my son ordered food which they served after 10 mins. i ordered food which they failed to serve at all. after 45 mins i asked where food was and they said they had forgotten to put the order through. no apologies no sorry just a shrug of the shoulders. i asked for the drinks bill and they never even offered a discount. the staff (male) were appalling. they didn’t seem to have a clue what was going on. i’ve had family in leeuwarden for 36 years. i will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again!!!
"we went with the family for a lunch. the menu is a bit simple. some sandwiches, omelettes, croques and croquettes... for vegetarians no other options than a sandwich goatcheese. or order things without the ham or bacon common.... pls think of something el "
"this was a great place to break our journey en route from groningen to alkmaar. the cafe is situated beside the canal near to a bridge festooned with flowers. inside the wonderful 1930/40’s decor seemed unchanged. we sat near the water taking in all sorts of activity such as an elderly lady in in traditional dress addressing a small group of people and a group of young men singing for anyone who cared to listen. the leeuwarden is to be capital city of culture 2018, could be lots going on…"
ordinary bar/pub. i havent tried their dinner but nachos and fried cheese. cheese was quite nice although nachos had only little cheese.
came to this cafe for coffees and found that the members of staff were very unpleasant and the service was not good!
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
now this is a really relaxed place very casual they have excellent food and every week they have a changing menu. always friendly people and in the summertime you can even sit outside. not too many tables so during rush hours it might be handy to make a reservation.
"i found this restaurant to be of a reasonable standard. the staff were friendly and efficient and the food provided was of a good standard. i had lamb which i thought was a little over cooked, however , to be fair there were 28 of us eating having not booked. i would recommend a visit ."
"one of the few places open for breakfast (most places don’t open till noon). no eggs here, but good coffee, tea, hot chocolate. we had granola with yoghurt and fruit, and some pancakes. good!"
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that ‘it’s an old hotel’ ‘you can leave if you wish’. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: “so my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink 
"this is a stunningly designed restaurant in an old post office. i was dining alone and sitting at a long sharing table. the menu is deceptively big but different dishes for different times of the day, so the choice per meal is small and all tast "
the choices in the menu were very small. if you don’t eat meat or fish you’re not able to eat here. fries didn’t taste well. and the didn’t had the beer on the menu. bad experience.
grand cafe post plaza  in leeuwarden is a nice place to eat and drink. .........clean and cozy.... the price is good and staff are nice and quick service
"after waiting for ten minutes on a dirty table, that was not cleaned yet, we did ask the girl if we could order, she took the tip from the previous people and walked away with our order, but left the table full with the dirty cup "
the place is cozy and very enjoyable with the cat 
"went for an evening meal, an overcooked so called dry aged steak was 67 euros which they insisted could be shared by 2 people but wasnt, i had a chicken breast which cost £30 euros, nicely cooked but not worth that price as there were no vegetables and they brought a small dish of chips which was enough for one person but there were 5 of us, if we wanted more they were ext "

"it’s a great place when you have a lot of time, the food takes ages before it’s served. the staff is nice."
"we had a very large group and only about half of our group enjoyed their meals. we recommend the aged steak, bread starter, and the lava cake (with caramel!). we do not recommend the eel or other fish starter, bravette, or pasta sala "
basic food presented nicely. would not recommend for the food but the place and location is great. i think you can go here for drinks and snacks.
"a friend who lives here wanted to treat me to a special meal. love the outdoor seatings, service & decors especially the location in the old prison. we had the 4 dishes tasting menu. it was 3 meat and a fish dish. loved the fish and the duck but the starter a ‘steak tartar with raw egg york’ was a no for me. i eat everything except ‘raw meat’, i don’t mind it medium rare but raw with a raw egg york was too much for me. i appreciate the creative ideas. wished there were more seafood and vegetables."
"had dinner with wife,son, daughter-in-law and three ki "
super location- had the surprise menu for 2- 4 courses- 3 meat 1 fi 
"i think after a mention in the michelin guide they are chasing a star. however they need to look at their tactics. the menu is small and very experimental which is fine. however a good restaurant would have a fall back of more standard dishes. even the soup of the day was a cold one. if there is nothing you like the look of then there is no where to go. i had the ceviche and the salad for starter the raw fish was like eating oysters (which i love) but without the fresh taste of the sea and citrus. the salad had everything thrown in and a selection of all the sauces they do of all colours, not particularly enjoyable. my son had the goose which was supposed to come with a different salad but it looked the same to us. it was not much better than mine. we fell back on the dry aged ribeye because of the limited choice. it was okay standard steak, cooked ok. the bearnaise did not taste home made. sitting outside was okay, but no table cloth and the large black plastic numbers stuck on the tables did not help the ambiance. for desert i had the creme brulee which was very nice, and my son the panna cotta which was fine. he had lived in leeuwarden for a year and always wanted to visit this restaurant. he brought me as a treat and was disappointed it did not work out as expected. the service was ok but being one of the few outside we felt we were sometimes an after thought. a very average evening there are better in the town."
"we had nice drinks in the afternoon and reserved for an early dinner in the evening. when we reported reservation was not there but we got the table near the waterside. ordered directly and had drinks, after 30 min. we asked where the food was, sorry the kitchen starts as from 17.30. we had our food at 18.00 and the service was  not very dedicate "
the male manager was so rude. telling us to leave as soon as we had finished our coffee and threatening us if we didn’t. not a relaxed coffee and over priced. do not go!!! 😠
"after being told they couldn’t cater for a group of 10, 4 of us sat down for coffee and cake. the waiter was extremely rude on several occasions giving us time limits we had to eat and order more food by. he said if we didn’t order more food and drink within 5 minutes he would kick us out (we were the only customers here and had been sat down not even 30 minutes). he spoke to use disgustingly and sarcastically and i wouldn’t come back here even if i was paid. he then proceeded to wave his hand and point aggressively into all our faces trying to move us out our seats of which he scared us so we had to leave. over priced arrogant managers - take your money elsewhere as it’s a lovely little town but this guy shouldn’t be in public service."
"we stopped at this restaurant for a coffee in the sun. after 30 minutes we were told we needed to order more food or we had to leave. the manager was so rude, intruded our personal space and waited until we left. do not visit this restaurant, it’s overpriced and the customer service is disgusting."
we went to this restaurant during a one day excursion to leeuward 
"this looked a very good bet - well located just to the side of the city centre on an attractive square and with an attractive interior, this was a disappointment. the service was very slow and inattentive...and one point 2 of the service team were sat at the bar whillst we were waiting to have our plates cleared and the whole dinner process became a chore, including even paying the bill which took just so long. the food itself was ok....not outstanding and certainly not good value (expensive for what we received) and the menu and drinks menu was surprisingly restricted. staff were very friendly, i must say, but just the whole system was slow, slow, slow."
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but don’t order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. “i’ll tell the chef” was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
"bad place, the menu is different from the one in the photo. a waitress spilled sauce on my girlfriend, dirtying her jacket, shirt and trousers. they never apologized or gave any discount, they didnt even ask if they could help. also the meat wasnt good, it tasted like supermarket meat. "
"we booked a table for 5 persons but it was not ready when we arrived. this was a bit disappointing. it is a big place and the staff walks around with headsets which makes it a bit plastic and not personal to my opinion. the steaks were delicious, no doubt. but not a place to go for a romantic quiet dinner, more casual with friends."
"at first glance, a pretty and decent institution. beautiful glass sails create a cozy place. but do not rush! appearance is deceiving and this is the case. the second time i visited this avidion, i was convinced that i would definitely never come back and spend my 1.2 or 100 euros. why??? because, disagreeable service. lack of service. sleepy staff roam the hall, who are too lazy to smile, say hello. by their general appearance and manner of communication, you might think that you came to but to their home and they, giving you a huge favor, gave you tea / coffee / dish. further, on my first visit, the lady waiter 40+ presented me with a bill of vegetarian salad and two beers at 25 euros. at first i paid her in cash, even left a tip for a couple of euros. but after that, i looked in the menu to find out the price of beer. and it turned out that my bill was 20 euros. after discussing this, she returned 5 euros. without saying even sorry. today, i decided to look again at this “farmer’s den” hoping to catch a different atmosphere there. and what do you think? at the arena, the same ladies. with the same bias, not a welcoming look and complete antipathy. the only plus for today, did not have to wait a long time for the dish, as the institution was empty. but the bill, i had to wait, because the waiter (the same lady 40+) had a nice chat with the man and without paying any attention to me, demonstrating clearly ignore. she did not pay attention that i had already left the table, went to the cash register and was ready to quickly pay the bill. i was in a hurry, as it was time to run on the train. disgusting staff! disgusting service! complete antipathy to the institution, even in other cities. i will not go to this place even in other cities, and i will never recommend this loetje cafe to my friends / acquaintances / relatives."
"nice location and inside set-up. average service. got a hamburger and a fish, both not enough cooked."
we chose to have a meal here because my partner wanted to try frisian food. however i dont think the menu is at all frisian. they brought us sausage coated in white chocolate when we arrived. i am vegetarian so my boyfriend ate both. they then brought some bread with tapenade and some olive oil jelly. i am sure frisians are not eating this at home. during this time we still waited for the menu. it seemed odd to wait so long. my boyfriend chose a fish dish and i chose the only veggie opti 
 we had to wait ages for our meals and the waiter was not friendly. the food was great though and the ambience is super. but the waiters attitude brought the whole experience down. a sha 
"tasty but. starter was a tomato soup with meatballs. it was ok. after the starters er had to wait a long time before the served the main. i had the walrus burger, tasty but it was red inside. i am normally a guy who order the beef medium rare, but you cant serve a burger that way. that is terrible. for dessert there was ice cream and fruit, it was a generous portion."
de walrus has a nice vibe. outside is a basic seating area and the inside is huge and cozy. food is fine.
the most unusual aspect of this cafe is the way they present copious dishes of rhubarb with every meal despite it often not complementing the dish chos 
"food is okay. staff is very bad, they keep you waiting while they are not doing anything. and seem very grumpy at the table. i had this experience multiple times. by far the worst staff in town."
"the walrus is the big name in leeuwarden for eating and drinking. it occupies two and a half historical building and has a large terrace in front of it. the lunch special was a rather sizeable and tasty meatball for a good price, not bad. they could strengthen the menu a bit in low-carbohydrates and vegetarian options. service is friendly, though a little distracted, and not very fast. it was an irritant that the staff were quite busy rearranging the terrace during lunchtime (12:30) on a sunny saturday. removing gas heaters to be able to draw in the huge parasols, storing stuff right behind our back whilst we were working on the meatball. this could be done more pro-actively earlier i think."
we decided to have dinner here as the menu board at the entrance showed some dishes that would be compatible with certain intolerances we ha 
the service runs entirely via an apple ipod. so chances are that the service becomes impersonal. which is the case and the server blames it on the system! 
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere but when it come to the food we were a bit disappointed. the service was very slow and when we finally received our meals they were just average and therefore a little bit overpriced in my opinion.
since entering the city we had multiple attempts of people trying to get us to have dinner at the walrus. one even offering us free drinks if we di 
"went for the second time a couple of months, with similar experience "
"we visited this place on hemelvaartsdag for dinner and it was very busy. we ordered drinks and they came swiftly. also the food was quick to arrive. the staff is wonderful and very helpful. we had a walrus burger (medium rare), pork fillet sate and 2 salmon steaks. the burger was not medium rare as promised on the menu and the salmon steaks were full of little bones. ok, it is a steak and not a fillet, but still. the sate consisted of large chunks of meat, heavily marinated, but not dry. the sate sauce and atjar were very good. fries were great, salad and fruit compote nice. overall a nice place to have an uncomplicated dinner, but the food can be improved."
"dont get me wrong. this place is solid, but from when i started going there three years ago it lost some of its charm. definitely doesnt deserve the #1 rating it has. again, i still go there but there are other places in town that offer better food (unless youre really into bar food). the beer selection though is great as are the staff and the atmosphere is unique. definitely go, just beware that its not really a #1 pick. "
"very central bar/restaurant. staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is good. menu was very varied, with specials available. the quality was fine and the prices very competitive.  recommended for a quick, basic lunch."
"last night we decided to dinner in leeuwarden. i picked the no.1 restaurant in leeuwarden to celebrate our 2 years relationship. service of the waiters is nice they are really pay attention to the guests. this restaurant really busy in the weekend. i ordered vlees trio but sadly the meat its too cold and the fries also. so i told the waiter and they gave me extra meat and fries, but frankly its almost the same they are not really hot when arrive in to my table. because shortly lots of people coming to dinning the service bit slow, we have to wait 10 minutes for our last coke col "
i was here on a monday night on my own for business. as it was the only restaurant with people on the market near my hotel i choose to have my dinner here. i took a glass of red wine and the tame duck for a main course. quality of the food was oke and the amount was more than reasonable. for the rest nothing special to report.
"nice place and food, super slow service. they have some burgers which, personally i did not find attractive (too greasy, simple, heavy...lets just throw some stuff). i waited for a beer half an hour, literally. and also when we asked for a receipt they were slow. excuse was: it is busy "
very busy restaurant. waiters are nice and friendly. food was not very good. steak was weldone and the other raw.
"i went here with a partner for our first date (long distance relationship) we ordered a platter and it was good but after we paid and left we noticed that the waitress who had been cranky all evening and hadnt even cracked a smile or welcome us had not given us the right change and we wer 13 euros short (hadnt noticed at time as she was rushing us and we never recieved a typical bill she just came up with a bum bag of change and told us the price , no reciept nothing so we gave her the money and worked it out afterwards that we had been short changed and 13 euros is quite alot to lose when theire platters of food is about that mu "
"this bar/restaurant is excellent for drinks, tea and cake (i highly recommend the monchou taart) or lunch but not so much for dinner.  i think the quality of the dishes is okay but not good enough to justify the (high) price."
"the location in the historic centre is great, but the food is bog standard stuff, the staff is efficient but are just that, no attention to their customers, other than the obligatory everything ok?"
the service is great: the waitresses were all very helpful and friendly; they were fast and efficie 
friendly staff and ok food. nice atmosphere. lacking a bit in taste of the food- too nice in a way. would liked the tastes a bit more experimental.

"used to come here 3 times a year, this time i came with my girlfriend for a nice diner. we could pick our own table since we were reasonably early. after we sat down the waitress seemed tired or something, anyway we ordered some drink at first and looked into the menu card which had broad options. after decided what to eat we needed to wait 4 minutes for the waitress to notice us. we ordered carpaccio as starter that had some grilled cheese on it (odd combination) which had an overwhelming taste. after that we went for the main course, we took the rib-eye steak and spareribs (kinda cheesy food i know) food was reasonably fast at our table. while eating the waitresses had no eye for us anymore and couldnt get their attention for something to drink so had to wait 10 minutes before we could finally draw their attention. starter couldve been better, main course was nice but the employees werent capable of managing 10 tables with 3 waitresses. i used to enjoy the hospitality of the owner and his big smile but he was working at the bar unfortunately. "
"the only reason to come here is that it is cosy. old fashioned with lots of candles at night. however, the food is not great and the service is much too slow. i would not return. there are better choices out there. there are steep stairs to the bathroom. on the stairwell there is an old fashioned marble sink and a faucet. in the bathroom there are blaring commercials for this restaurant(!?)."
i had the fish & chips which was not very expensive but certainly not a bargain either. for that price i would have expected cod but im pretty sure i got hake. staff is very friendly and there is a wide range of beers to choose from.
"the lunch menu contained beaf, chicken, pork, lamb etc  even after indicating i was vegan and explained what it meant i still got a salad with cheese....  restaurant is nice on the inside and has an old school feel to it."
its a nice place where eat something traditional. always was good and the price was not so expensive. good beers and kindness owner!
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description. 
this restaurant was chosen by an opinion gave by the recepcionist from the hot 
"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didn’t order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didn’t show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."

located near the railwaystation but quiet. has a nice terrace. not sure about the food quality. rather mixed opinions. good for a quiet drink on the terrace. the inner room is less cosy.
"this was one of the few places that didnt look too pretentious in the area. it was not too late in the afternoon but the place seemed very quiet. anyway, the waitress was very helpful and we had a good, basic, meal."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"as the title says. the sausage (rookworst) is awesome. the other food is good, nice and the shop is super-dutch. a must for foreign tourists"
the shop is not very special. quality of products is good but not exceptional. the interior of the store is a not very attractive
lower price range department store... no more and no less.
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
"well, what to say? i guess we all know what mcdonalds is, and if you dont, keep it that way. they serve what you call fast food. im not against fast food perse, but it should be nutritious, healthy and well cooked. it was not well cooked, im sorry to say. the burger i had was still on some spots raw and under cooked. toilets were dirty and the personnel were rude and impolite. when i asked for a moment to decide, the lady behind the counter walked away and served someone else. i really need only a second to read the menu. fast food and fast serving. oops. im really sorry, i hoped for a better experience, but unfortunately it was not. next time no mcdonalds."
"generally, i do not recommend american fast food while traveling abroad.  however, if you walk by, go in and get an order of fritz with fritz sauce."
"nice burger joint. trendy, rock and roll interior a bit reminiscent of a hard rock. decent, build your own burgers. nothing really surprising in that note. decent selection of beers to wash it all down. nice staff."
"went with a group of colleagues.  ordered the drinks fairly quickly, but it took 45 mins for menus to arrive! almost 1 hour 30 for food to show up.  when it did, it was your fairly good but also average café burger."
"absolutely delightful atmosphere, our group stayed for almost three hours. the food is good, just not mindblowing. its worth the prices though, so i didnt exactly feel let down or anything. we stayed inside as it is october, but double b has large, very comfy-looking yeard and terrace for summer. i like the way you build your burger yourself, as in choose the bun, patty, sauces and extras all by yourself, so you get what you want easily. just because of that id recommend this to families and large groups, there is something for everyo "
"had found double b on tripadvisor and thought the restaurant sounded promising. i was visiting the city of leeuwarden with my family for the weekend so we all went down there for some dinner. in my personal opinion, i thought that the decor was tacky with an overwhelming characteristic of a shrine to the usa accompanied by music that was played several notches too loud. it took a while to know where to go as once inside the building there are several directions one can choose to go in, and there is no direction of which way you should go for what. once we were finally seated at a table in the bar/restaurant area, the staff left us and ten minutes later we still had not been given any menus and had yet to have had a drinks order taken so, my patience having been worn somewhat thin, i flagged down a member of staff and asked if we could make a drinks order and get some menus. once we had the menus, which are really cool by the way, you write on it with a marker to personally customise your burger, choosing the bread, the meat, toppings, sauce etc. it took an extra 15 minutes and some serious hinting on my behalf for the staff to notice us yet again. my mother had some enquiries into what the veggie burger was made out of, which the server did not know but said he would find out and come back; which he never did, this was very disappointing as he was the friendliest server that they had sent our way so far. once we had finally been able to order, no one at any point came back to take anymore drinks orders that in the end meant i went to the bar to order our drinks, which was inevitably the quickest service we had seen all night. i guess what they say about if you want something done properly then do it yourself seems to have been particularly true at this place. the food was delicious once it had arrived, so kudos to the kitchen. the slow service prevailed however and we eventually had to go up to pay rather than ask anyone for the bill. whilst i do imagine, this is an anomaly rather than the norm, as the majority of reviews are very good; the night was extremely disappointing because of all the good reviews i had previously seen on tripadvisor, and had been therefore excited to eat there. needless to say that i was entirely disenchanted by the affair and will not be returning there in a hurry."
"again i am surprised about all the 5* reviews for this restaurant based on the quality of the food we ate. we arrived without a reservation on a friday night and found a table for two. the vegetarian dim sum is fried and not steamed, which was a surprise but tasted quite good. spring rolls were as you would find anywhere. for the sate main the vegetarian choice was just ok (sauces not that good), but the fish was barely cooked let alone barbequed (see photo with review). i could have done better myself in 15 minutes at home, possibly the trainee chef was on this night. as they seem to specialise in sate i found this top be a poor show. maybe this is a place for meat-eaters as wouldnt recommend for nayone to try."

"on the plusside the cafe has a great location on the canal. but when we went there it took 45 minutes to get drinks and 2 hours to get something to eat. and they basically just serve sandwiches and other light meals. maybe they had a bad day, but i wouldnt choose this place if i didnt have alot of time to spend waiting..."

"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
"as a snackbar it’s quite commercially operated and loses the touch with its customers , could do with a lot more personal attention"
"went there with wife while waiting for daughter. very nice drinks, superb upstairs which is probably better to sit in than downstairs. good for people watching."
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
"my wife and i had lunch here, i ordered saltbeef and liver, my wife homemade beef burger. i ask the waitress what sort of liver it was, she asked the chef and he said it was cows liver. to my amazement i received processed liver sausage with big white pieces of fat through out. my wife beef burger appeared to be home made, but was cooked in advance. from the time we ordered our meal to receiving it would not have been long enough to cooked such a big burger, it was just reheated, but not hot enough to melt the cheese topping. i eat my lunch after all it was liver, my wife returned her burger, she was offered an alternative butt by now she had lost her appetite."
away from the larger cities in the netherlands this restaurant in sneek is okay for a local experience. however compared to many other place around de tuut is average at bes

"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if we’d reserve a table for 6:30pm, we’d have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again. "
"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."
a group of sailor friends we went to the place last night. the food was just ok but the staff were so uninterested in helping us sort the menu out. we waited a long time to be served and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. when we left there was no good b

it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"this evening we (a family of 5) stopped by this hotel restaurant because we always enjoy the van der valk menu. however, after being seated we were ignored for 10 minutes. i then went to pick up some menus myself so that we could choose our meals. however, a further 10 minutes passed and we were still completely ignored. we tried to call over a waiter to place our orders but no-one responded. finally we just left and went to another restaurant. so i cannot give a review of the food at this place because we never got any.

"on the 1st of january, we were looking forward to a nice evening with good food and service in a nice atmosphe "
"made a timely reservation for 20 people - birthday celebration - and received a phone call just the night before: we have to cancel; we made an error in your booking - try somewhere else - no sorry, no sympathy, no effort to reschedule - just basically get lost. never trust this place when you have an important event."
"there is place for 300 people i guess and it was almost full. the food is really nice, if they have it. they we out of chicken!!! 😳 the taste of the food was good but the portions were not all equal, some got a small piece some got a huge piece of meat, i would say the double. the tables are too big (for me it is more inportant that i can talk with the person in fron of me than the decoration of the table, that together with the noise make the place not as nice as it could be). but overall was good."
this is another van der valk restaurant with reasonable quality of food at a friendly price level. the splendid view over the adjacent lake is a bon 
"with me van der valk restaurants conjured up an image of a road side restaurant, where you could obtain a quick lunch or dinner for a reasonable price, with ample food of medium quality. added to the fact that i had not visited van der valk for more than ten years, i was surprised at the nicely appointed big restaurant inside the van der valk hotel in sneek. we dined there on friday evening and saturday evening. if i would only review the dinner experience of friday the review result would have been easily 4 points with something to spare. delicious food, friendly and dedicated service, a superb italian wine and a table in a quiet corner, who could ask for more. so, anticipating another splendid meal, we booked the same table for the saturday evening. however, the experience of this evening was less satisfactory. the entree was ok, but with the main course the problems started. never mind that the person who served us with the main course was very indifferent, almost rude and shoved the dishes on the table on any old spot without taking care that the we could reach the dishes without getting up from the table, but the big problem was the quality of the side dishes. the cauliflower was still frozen; the french fries and fried potatoes were obviously recycled. i really want to believe that food leftovers from the tables are not used again at van der valk but with this experience i start to wonder. we sent it all back to the kitchen of course but we marveled about the difference in quality between the friday and the saturday. also we wondered that those side dishes ever could have been approved in the kitchen. that is why my review is only three points and explains the mixed feelings. one really positive observation i want to share is that every table received fresh linen after it was cleared! this is the standard in italy of course but in dutch restaurants the table linen is virtually glued to the table and gets only a superficial brush down after the table is cleared. high marks for van der valk in this area. the price of the food is of course of the inflated dutch variety, but in moderation. dutch restaurants have the highest prices in europe, but here at van der valk the prices are moderate for dutch standards. conclusion: mixed feelings and hit or miss."
"a week ago, after an excellent dinner and friendly service, we made a reservation for a table for the consecutive sunday. unfortunately we made the opposite experience on our second visit: no table available outside at the time agreed, unfriendly and arrogant behaviour by the « cheffe » (style: couldn’t care les "
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an ‘i told you we were busy’. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"friendly service but poor food.started with popcorn with paprika and a kind of kerry dipsauce which is a strange choice for an appetizer;i had the gnocchi which were tasteful but the main course(fresh fish) was very disappointing,sauce was too thick,fish not really fresh...the white wine proposed by the waiter was a viognier montmarin and was very good.i hope it was just a bad day for the cook because the service was friendly but the food bad and clumsy presentation."
just a normal restaurant with decent food but nothing out of the ordinary. kind staff and the size of the portions are more than sufficient.
"if youre looking for nice solid food, you wont be disappointed here. things like schnitzel, burgers and steak are on the menu."
"i put average on my review because of the decor and the friendliness of the staff; however, the culinary experience was not for us a big succe "
"this coffee shop is across the plaza from the centrall station and opens early. if you need to catch an early train, or arrive in apeldoorn early, you can find good coffee and breakfast treats at a very reasonable price. the atmosphere is friendly and the food is fresh! its only a few blocks away from the central shopping area."
the sub is more or less what you can expect from subway but service is poor and slow. the coffee was in a tiny cup and just drinkable so best to stick to sodas.
worst customer service we ever experienced in a mcdonalds. 3-4 employees looking at you waiting to place an order at the mccafe. after several minutes of waiting i decided to place an order at the machine. it took 5 minutes until somebody appeared at the coffee machine despite no other tasks at this point of time for the employees. coffee cooking took another 10 minutes. after completion the two cups were placed on a cupboard to be picked up by another employee. additional 2-3 minutes waiting time while most employees were just doing nothing. of course the two cups had no marking indicating what the cappuccino and what the latte machiatto is. overall highly disappointing and badly organized. the management needs to start working on a lot of issues in this restaurant.
"had a mckroket; those are interesting. a pretty standard mcdonalds with free wifi and decent service, but they have the machines at the front so you dont have to interact with anyone if you dont want to, you asocial silly person. :)"
"tastefull chips as long as one still is able to eat. belgian style, i think, it was nice for as long as it lasted, but with the times, i have developped a sensitive stomach, but that is with eating in general. i think i definitely suffered hostile medical support, somewhere else. its kind of sad not to be able to really endure any food anymore. "
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had saté. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "
"we were in 20 people, ordered different dishes, starters and desserts. i ordered risotto with forests mushrooms and.. it was really bad risotto with champignons.. and frozen asparagus. bad taste, too salty. forests mushrooms only from bullion cube. not worth that price. my boyfriend ordered duck, which was also not so tasty. too chewy and without duck tas "
"my husband and i visited in the opening month. we were quite disappointed and would much rather have a very tasty burger for half the price at finnegans pub in the center. food was edible though, but we wont be visiting aga "
the restaurant looks very nice (i was staying in the hotel) and the staff is dressed very smart. had the signature dish the short ribs. presented very nice but for my taste there was to much fat and to little real meat. the freshnstrawberry and ice cream dessert was good! prices are reasonable.
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.

"what a waste. no way she was going to serve me a cup of tea “no way sir, not my job” and serving me a kroket that was rotten: “yes sorry, i already thought it was off’. if i was the owner i would be ashamed. but apparently they completely lost it, don’t care anymore and you as a customer should not care either. don’t go. there is tons of places in the area that love to serve with a smile and deserve your money more then ever."

"it was a first time for us that we were going to a van der valk restaurant; it is a very big restaurant, service is friendly and quick...the food is less that average (i ate better in some dutch snack-bars..), but what shocked us was the moment when the waiter brought our bottle of bordeaux to our table already opened...apparently the restaurant manager had ordered to have the bottles of wine already opened this because not all young serving staff did get a proper horeca training. that was a first even in the netherlands (after 33 years leaving here.. :-) ) "

"we arrived at the restaurant and had no reservation. it tok about five minutes before someone from the staff noticed us. we asked foir a table for two and that was no problem, even we had no reservation. it took a while (again) before they gave us the menu. we orderd something to drink and that took nearly ten minutes before we get something. after that everything seems to go smoother, but the gap between the apatizer and the main menu was hughe. thats why we doubt to order a dessert. we desided to order it and now there was a normal gap between the main menu and the dessert. we desided not to go there again and for sure not with guests"

"nice atmosphere, friendly staff. didnt listen very well to our order. we asked the childrens steak to be prepared well done but received it very raw. side dish to my salad never arrived. not much attention from staff once our food was served. food itself was oke, not spectacular but reasonable quality for the price we paid."
"whether it is because of the low ceilings, but dinner in this restaurant was not really a pleasant affair.  the food is good but the atmosphere in and the ambiance of the restaurant did not do it for us on this occasion."
"purely for food and dining experience, i would rate this place 3 points, average. but because of all the dogs they allow inside, i cannot rate this place more than 2 points. i will not retu "
"i had lunch here with a former co-worker. when we arrived and found a table, we ordered our drinks and asked for the menu. after getting the drinks, we still had no menu, so after another 5 minutes we tackled another waitress to ask again for a menu. when we ordered our food the appliance the waitress used already had problems. food came quickly and was fine. as the waitress removed our plates we immediately asked for the bill as my friend needed to get back to the office and had only 15 minutes left untill her meeting. we waited for at least 10 minutes and still had no bill, so we decided to get up and find a check-out option. the waitress asked if we had already gotten a receipt: no we didnt, we asked for one 10 mins ago and nothing... she would check it out. she came back and said that our order could not be found in the computer, so another employee came, wrote down our order and had to input it in the computer again. by that time my friend was already too late for her meeting. after about 15 mins we finally got our bill and could pay. what irritated me most what that we got no apology whatsoever. no discount, no coupon for next time.. nothing."
had a good lunch with a business relation. nice waiter who almost works there for 25 years. we ate some eggs and had some coffee. everything fine. tables are close to each other in certain areas of the restaurant so would not go there for a romantic dinner.
"we were there in february for a business / relach dinner ... nice place, cosy place, fresh food, nice drinks ... but can only be considered as exceptionnal, fabulous, fantastic,  "
"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "

"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"the food is excellent, but.. what a pity that the restaurant is on a top day fully booked.. and the tables are cramped.. the people you see are people who you find normally in snackbars.. and are not really appreciating good food...the price of the wines is 3times what you pay in the stores.. and that is what i find a rip of.. but there is plenty of staff and they really do their best.. so what is wrong with us?? we think the chef deserves a better clientele... and guest who are willing to pay more and have some more space.."
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"i believe several times i consumed a drink, a smoothy, or a coffee, or a hot chocolate, for it looks hip, that restaurant, or has organical products, american quality, but i dont get the things done, that need to be done, its all waste of time. and it costs money, all those things do, and i dont make any friends, anemies, yes. "
"it is a pity that the brick and mortar shops nearby are empty, for rent. the street with the outside tables is not lively. service is fine. food is good."
nice coffee and a relaxed entourage. we did only some drinks but the menu looks great and tasty. one small comment: there was no baby changing place.
"this place is nothing special: just a corner restaurant where you can get bagels (different varieties with different toppings), juices, coffees. bagels are good though, served warm. several kinds of cream cheeses to choose from too. all in all nice place for lunch if you dont want anything fancy."

"fantastic meal at this establishment, but the hotel room was rather disappointing - not enough attention to detail and too dark.  lights broken, decor a bit tatty.  i would eat here again, but not stay."
"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"

"very average food, in an average hotel. staff friendly, but poor quality food for a four star hotel. dinner and breakfast both over-priced for quantity and quality. go just up the road to restaurant de heerlijckheyt het loo, and youll get a much better meal."
"the two other top rated restaurants in apeldoorn were fully booked so we fell back on the navet, rated #3. while the food was generally good, each dish of the 3-course menu was over-complicated. no wonder it took ages for the cooks to prepare them. also, the alsatian pinot gris flavour was off as it had obviously been kept for too long (375ml bottles do not keep well). the last straw was when we were charged a supplement of 17 eur for two small pieces of veal sweetbread which had been offered without information about the cost. its a shame how these small details can ruin an otherwise positive experience."
"it was a take-away hot chocolate, i didnt consume on the terrace, which looked nice enough, because i also feel the need to smoke a sigarette, when i consume such a drink, but i think the wheather was to bad, to much wind, so i consumed it somewhere else."
nice please to hang a round to haven an easy meal with a couple of drink.the haven open towards 6 o’clock in the event (18:00)
we sat down for a quick lunch at this place. the tomato soup took for ever to arrive.   i had one beer and was never asked if i would like another. waving didn’t help either!
"very slow & we had a very unprofessional waiter. even with a half empty restaurant. thankfully, food was tasty when it arrived. will not be going back"
"location very nice got outside table, with perfect view of square.  omelet cold and greasy. not able to cafe latte eith lowfat milk. service friendly - but had to wait for service - even very few guests."
"we went here late one afternoon and quickly found a seat. we had planned on just having a drink but as we stayed longer decided to be lazy and have food as well. we had the house red wine to drink, which was nice and at €11 per small carafe good value. for food we had vlammetjes to share, i settled on the satay java and my mum on the vissersverdriet. my satay was bone-dry, there was one piece of kroepoek (prawn cracker) and the rest of the plate was just filled with chunky chips. my moms vissersverdriet was smoked salmon on toast, nothing more then that. she even stated that the cucumber seemed to be missing. not worth the price. well stick to drinks the next time we visit. although the vlammetjes were lovely."
"we were in apeldoorn for an antique market, and it was time to eat something. we had a choice of restaurants to go to, and we chose this one because its menu included uitsmijters...a favorite of mi "
"stopped here on a sunny weekday afternoon to have a drink on the terrace in the summer sun. the ambiance was really nice on the square next to the old town hall, with its carillon bells going of regularly. the service was prompt, friendly and appropriate with a good attitude towards me, my wife and my toddl "
"so we cycled to apeldoorn and sat a grand café, at the moment we came in some people where just about to leave their table at the window. perfect we thought so we can keep an eye on our bikes. their cups and glasses where still on the table but we did not bother, because we expected they would be taken away immediately by the waiter. after a few minutes (5 or so) a waiter comes and we order two cappuccino and both a piece of apple cake. after 7 minutes or so we finally get our cappuccinos in glasses which where not washed very well. (meanwhile the other glasses are still on the table) the waiter goes away, and we assume he is going to get the apple cake. but no, he starts hanging out with the other waiters. after 5 minutes we finally get our apple cake. that took long, but they had most likely put it in the oven to warm up a bit. noooo the ice crystals almost on there that cold it was. we where lucky an other waiter spotted the other glasses and finally took them away. for >10 euros we expect a bit more, it does not have to be perfect but a clean cup would have been nice. and in winter you do not serve cold apple pie."
"needed to go into apeldoorn center to buy some gifts.   was a bit hungry and tried de notaris.   simple dishes, but okay.   maybe more suitable for a drink."
"service was poor, too few staff for a busy evening. food wasnt bad, but have waited for it a bit too long. as you get your printed bill after you pay i didnt notice they put one extra drink i didnt have on it. not good, will not go there again, definitely not recommended."
"after reading the reviews we visited this restaurant in apeldoon, was very disappointing experience, the owner who runs this restaurant has the word guest hospitality not in his vocabilary very rude. the service from the waiters was ok & the food reasonable but surely not worth the price they charge. i had crème brûlée for desert, that desert i really dont know how they dare to offer that. it doent come any where 1% close to what crème brûlée  "
"came with a group, our company fills at least two tables here each evening. put us on a table that was way too small. did not want to solve this, needed some heavy persuasion to get an extra chair that was given with a manner than can only be described as contempt. foodwise, i had the seasonal menu, first course was average and common, main course was a good piece of meat but with far more salt than needed for this quality, dessert again was not special. "
"the quality of the food is good: i had the deep fried mushrooms with herb-cream sauce as a starter and it was a good as i remembered. main dish grilled salmon with risotto. nice piece of salmon, grilled to perfection: very moist and tender. the portions are not huge and i think the prices are a bit high. for 2 people having both just 2 courses (of which for 1 person it was even a summer special menu for 24 euro), some bread to start and a total of 3 glasses of wine and 1 coffee, i think 75 euro is a bit over the top. therefore, the rating average."
we visit this restaurant on a sunday in december.  the restaurant was very nice decorated in x-mas style.. is was fully booked.  good  food and  great service.  the time betweem the different courses of the menu was too long.as a result of the many guests.
this is a restaurant since 1993 in an old buildi 
"the offered food is indeed very good, not cheap. the offered menu;s are too small and far to expensive for those little portions. staff is friendly and the service is ok."
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
"lovely terrace, descent food, chaotic service. i.e. go for lunch or a drink when the weathers fine - but expect slow service."
"nice place in the center of town. former school of music. on sunny days one of the favorits with locals, because of the big terrace with loung style seats. good spot, but for a beer or so, not for food; menu consists mosly of overpriced snacks and bites. staff sometimes seems more interested in eachother than in their guests"
"had lunch here, lured in by the nice outside sitting area and the advertising that they won a price in the past for a best lunch in the provin "
"to start, the waitress spilt an entire glass of beer into our friends handbag, offered an apology, these things happe "
before a movie i took my family to this place for lunch. the little man had a burger. he asked for a well done burger and the waitress said it might be a bit dry. so he agreed to a little bit of pink insid 
"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."
"simple good food, no more no less,  sufficient choice and good to get you going for a long walk and/or ride by bike"
we waited one hour to place our order. then we simply gave up and decided to stick around in the sun (still no one helping us). we talked to four different people in the staff who kept saying “someone will come in a minute” or “please wait a few minutes”. some staff completely ignored us when we asked for help. terrible. unfortunately not many options considering this is a national park.
we have been passing by to have a beer after our bike ride and even after 40 minutes we did not get a waiter to take an order. we went inside and they told us to wait outside at the table and also contacted 4 staff outside. nothing. very bad service.
"from the outside the place looks ok, but when you enter it doesnt feel like a restaurant at all. more like a cafeteria in a retirement home. very old and ugly and not a good atmosphere. the price of the food and drinks is too high for the quality. such a shame because its a great locatio "
"let me first say that the food we ordered was amazing. this was a 10/10. the amount of food and the presentation were beyond our expectations. but as we were sitting next to the bar/kitchen, we were able to see our food being prepared and hear the employees talki "
"although the food is of good quality, the portions are very small, taking the high price into account.  furthermore, its clear that because of cutting costs, hardly any side dishes are being served. conclusion, good food, but very expensive.l and small portions."
the food is mediocre but expensive. the waitress was very rude to us and the other waite 
"perhaps we came at the wrong time; late for lunch and a tad too early for dinner! the place was crowded, but we were offered a table for two. the breakfast/lunch menu was on offer, but apart from salads, there was limited gluten free choice. i ended up with the dutch pea soup, which was very good, except for the fact that on a separate place they still offered me bread! half way through eating our meal, the menus were changed for the evening, so although i did not look at this menu, perhaps we should just have had a drink first and then waited before ordering a meal! nice place to sit and watch the world go by!"
"i was looking forward to trying out the food in this place for quite some time. i went with a group of friends just before the dinner service started with the idea to have a drink first and order food a bit later. we wanted to sit outside, but the available tables had no chairs (people from neighboring tables took them away), so we sat inside. no one came to show us to seats or to greet us (the staff was going around us, as if we were in their way). we sat on the table and waited for about 20 minutes before someone came to take an order. we had our drinks and waited for someone to come to collect food order, but no one did. we paid and lef "
"very nice atmosphere, great service. however, portion sizes are way too small. the dishes are definitely interesting but nothing crazy. by the 5th course i’m still not full. going to have to stop by mcdonalds on the way home to eat something substantial."
"this meal was a joke. we paid eur 90 per person for a 5 course meal (i use this term loosely) with wine pairing. normally i would not find this amout unreasonable, however if you totalled the weight of the 5 courses we were served, it came out to perhaps 150grams of food per person. i realize that nouvelle cuisine is often served in small portions but this was an insult. unfortuanley the wine portions were equally small. this was a tasting, not a meal! luckily they served free bread. the tastings were interesting and if you feel compelled to go to this restaurant, make sure you eat before you go."
"it was a great evening with colleagues. we ate at “het zusje”. the food was nice, some food was “really good” and other were “not my type”. you order 2 small dishes at the time, when you’re done you can order 2 new dishes. you can take all evening till 22:30 to order. the staff was friendly but they seem to forget us all the time. it was busy but not too bu "
i think all the ingredients i remember can or do grow nea 
this was part of a business outing. there was not a lot to do. plenty of lanes to use. we had three. the games are short. not really needed to play for a full hour if the number of people is limited. food choices are limited and basic but well prepared. seating is limited as well
"weve been going here for years (with different quality over time) but this was probably the last visit ever as the food was incredibly bad. imagine beef chewy like old gum and poured over with a can of soy and fish sauce which made it uneatable , rice which been sitting there for a day or so and calamari with such a dodgy smell that we had to sent it back straight away. the dishes can be very tasty if there are chefs doing a good job, in this case clearly not! "
"we went with a group from work. the food was good but the amount was way to small. 1 saté had to be shared by 2 people, only a few fries per person, etc. etc. overall way to little. we were promised 5 courses and only got 4. inside the restaurant it was way to hot. when we wanted to order tap-water we had to order it with a drink. which we did but still didnt get in the end. when we asked for water they send us bottled water, which we returned but still ended up on the tab. in the end they wanted to make it up to us by giving a free round of coffee which also turned up on the tab. overall a bad experience."
"visited this place on 8th may. arrived at8pm, but was told that the kitchen was closing at8.30 and that we should hurry to order. no english menu available, but waitress was happy to translate for us. its a tapas kind of place, you order plates and they come not necessarily in order youd like them to. nachos- very large portion, empanadas with goats cheese- i didnt like these as i didnt understand that they contain goat cheese, but my husband loved them. pizza- it came with egg mayo salad in the middle of it- rather bizarre! my mixed salad was standard, under dressed. over all- not impressed at all with the food, not to my liking. "
"ate hear whilst staying locally in this arty part of arnhem. goed looks inviting and is nicely set out with an open pizza kitchen and some historic touches. it was busy at 6.30pm and, as others have commented, the service was a little disorganised. we had 5 different people help us and were asked for our order twice. that said the pizza and patatas bravas were good. the sharing plate concept would work with a big party but a little lost on two people with small appetites. equally not sure having asian followed by pizza and then buffalo wings is really a good thing, other than after a lot of beer. nevertheless, we were happy with what we had, and the reasonable price. i would recommend a try, as you might find the quirky style more appealing."
"i love going here for dinner so i decided to take my friend here for lunch. presentation looked nice. but i didnt care for it too much. my friend had a philley cheese steak sandwich and i had the crazy dog. hers didnt have enough meat on it and my bread was a bit cold on one side and the saugages were a bit overdone but flavors were nice. nachos were ok. service took a while refilling our drinks. such a shame. again, i do love going here at night. great vibes, good service, etc. but the lunch was a bit of a let down."
"the space is very nice and the menu is interesting. the quality of the dishes varies. the spare ribs for instance were very nice whilst the cheese fondue tapa (10 euros) was very weak with leukewarm instant fondue mix and limp vegetables. i asked to reheat the fondue and could see from my table the waiters reheating it and forgeting it again on the counter, so it arrived at the table cold again. this was indicative of the service of the restaurant. the waiters were nice and welcoming, but a bit careless, easily distracted and talking to each other and forgetting to pick up dishes and orders. the other weak point was the quality of the drinks. i asked for a glass of their house wine, and was surprised they were charging over 4 euros for a small glass of wine of very poor quality. there are many inexpensive good wines available in the dutch market so this should not be difficult to change. overall it was pleasant and one feels the place has potential, but needs to spruce up the service an quality control."
"average food, staff drilled in the kim yung style. the handbook says you drink from the bottle, so your request for a glass is denie "
"it is a great formula, sharing food on the table. the wine is good and so is the atmosphere. but the food is to be honoust average, tends to be fat and lacks originality. friendly service"
sorry ...only one visite is needed here. if you tried it once youll know next time better try one of the other restaurants in town
"interesting concept, you can eat all types of cuisine there. the location is a bit down as theyre the only restaurant in the area, but worth visiting. the lunch menu is a little empty if you want to have a big lunch. service was friendly."
"food: can be nice, can be a complete disaster. service: is always slow or not there at all. not enough expertise over all. lots of mistakes and long waiting."
"good food, nice service and a great place to sit outside on the terrace. food taste good and is fresh made, price however is a bit high"
"took ages to get menus and food. no wine list-beware they have a choice of 2 red ,2 white or ro "
"the ambience in very nice. the wines delicious, but the food and the service very poor. the service is very slow, i guess because they dont have enough waitresses. the food is standard, nothing special."
we went here on the recommendation of our conscierge. the food was tasty butte portions mean for the money.  the service was slacker than id have expected given the feel the restaurant had. i hate to have to continually ask for refills and water.
"we visited this restaurant for dinner on a thursday night, and we were glad that we had previously booked online as it was completely full. the tables are very close togeth "
"nice location on the gorgeous jansplein in arnhem. sadly, the food wasnt up to par. the risotto was very salty, tasteless, and cooked to a mush. disappointed."
"meal was not bad, but really not special, i dont understand that it can be number one in tripadvisor. atmosphere was good price also okay they have 0,5 liter beer, so thats good."
"menu has a lot of options but the food wasnt worth the money you pay for it. also took them almost 1hr and 15 minutes to serve the main dish, specially the duck breast was waste of good duck, theres no armony in the flavors and the duck was dry and the bacon cold. biefstuk was ok but then again nothing special."
"very close to the central train/bus station of the city arnhem. its small, only a few tables, which makes it intimate. service is very good and friendly. excellent draft beers also, it helps!;) the food i ordered was average of taste, but my friends was very good. so it depends i guess... the bathrooms are downstairs and when you enter, you are instantly back into the 60s... wow.. it could use an upgrade. the atmosphere is excellent, it is warm, cosy and gezellig "
"we had a good dinner, appetizer of salmon was lovely flavorsome and well presented. main courses where average to good. schnitzel over baked a bit, angus beef (grilled part) could have been more medium. service was friendly. as the title suggests food is good enough but not living up to the statements of excellence (not something to blame the restaurant for). good food at a reasonable price, nothing wrong with that! but reviewers seeming to make this a culinary experience do injustice to visitors expectation and thus this restaurant. for a pleasant decent meal which is value for money this restaurant is a good thing."
"cheap, terrible place with terrible service and ambience... you ask for some bread together with your wine and they tell you that you can go to the fast food if you need bread. just two people work in this restaurant and if it is full they are unable to manage it and look desperate and become rude... i guess the only reason it is not bankrupted yet, it is in front of railway station"
we had a main course and dessert. its a cosy place where they serve a good quality for the price. however if you want to dine in luxury and have really tasty food i wouldnt suggest going here.
good enough for a good quick meal if you happen to be around in arnhem. the evening sun in summer caresses your body whilst eating. in a good way ;)  it is certainly above average. the chose for a high standard of standard food.
"ordered a cheese & ham omelette but given two eggs on cheese, tomato and onion. could not eat it as have ibs. we pointed out mistake to server but still charged for the course. complained but told we have to pay. sorry but will not return."
"terrible, rude, racist. as a group of mature, retired tourists we went to this cafe that looked very nice but we were ignored, our order wasn’t taken, other customers served ahead of us to the point we knew it was deliberate, perhaps because we were british. so disappointed when everywhere else in holland people have been friendly and we have received first class treatment."
"this is a very populair bar/restaurant in arnhem. price/quality is okay. its cosy, has nice staff who provide good service and the food tastes ‘jammie "
"ok place, food is ok and staff,  if you want a quick bite but portions are a bit on the small side and there are other places that are better"
"not busy, sticky table and had to divert to city hall for a clean toilet. when leaving the question if we had paid which i did 2 minutes before. so once but not again.."
i liked the architecture of this building. nice early 20th century insurance office turned into a bar and restaurant. i had a nice beer here with my friends. nothing special though.
"ok, nice atmosphere, open kitchen and good terrace outside. food is good. service always nice and friendly."
"service very slow, after 30 mins we had to attract the waiter to be able to order. freah mint teafor over 3 euro and glass was not even full of water. salads took another long time so an hour after arrival we atr. grilled asparagus on salad were stone cold aswas the pulled chicked on the other salad. in fact it wasnt pulled but pieces of the cheapest cut of the chicken, so cold that you couldnt taste the flavour and too cold to pull it yourself. over 15 euro each, so totally overpriced. when we mentioned this to the waiter he said oh, well we always serve it like this. such a shame coz we will never come back and wewill most certainly not tell others to go there..."
theres better coffee around but its good for meeting/dating/working cakes are really good and homemade.
"dudok is well known in arnhem as a meeting place, because it is easy to find and conveniently located next to the largest church in the city centre. drinks and especially the food is mediocre and prices are not very cheap. most of the times it is very loud inside which does not make it ideal for business meetings. "
centrally located next to test main square it it however average food quality. staff friendly and the building is spacious so youre not cramped up to others
"much too busy and asking too much for the drinks. terrible coffee, noisy , but it is the closest to the friday and saturday market ."
"dudok is located in a monument in the city center. good place for coffee in the shadow of the monumental eusebius church. pleasant terrace in summer but sometimes a bit windy, inside quite noisy. go here if you are not in a hurry as it might take a while to get your drinks and food. overall quite ok. "
"this place is located close to the church, has an open area, is normally very full, but does not have anything special. is a good normal cafe"
if you prefer an overpriced lunch or dinner this is the place for you! ive been here on both occasion and i can say without a doubt that the food is literally thrown on the plate without any compassion or love for the products what so ever. during lunch paying a high price for some leafs of lettuce and a few strips of chicken with some tasteless sauce sitting in a noisy rubbish ambience lacking large hall with careless staff did not tick my button 
"not very cheap, but good food and drinks. in the summer the courtyard graden is very nice and the terras at the front gets allot of sun."
"it had the same interior like dudok in rotterdam. it is a good place for a lunch. we we visiting on a saturday and were lucky to find a table around 13.30 hrs. the food and service is quite good. if you want to have a more private conversations, this might not be the right place."
"dudok is a chain/franchise & ive visited the cafés in the hague & rotterdam as well. the interior design had a 1930s feel to it, and the menu has good dutch café classics. we had drinks and bitterballen and it was fine, although the service was a little slow.as with all dudok cafés, the acoustics arent great so its always quite noisy when full."
i went their for dinner two nights this week. i had the pork neck on the first night and it was quite a hearty dinner although not lavi 
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."
"if you do not like the combination of rare french fries with mayonaisee, do not go to this restaurant. again, we have the reunie and we spent tea time, lunch and dinner at tr "
"we were five: two adults, one child and two babies. the service at the beginning was pretty good, the waiter explained everything but the main course came after 30 minutes. the waiting was too much since we ordered steak, fish, two chicken nuggets and the restaurant was empty. only  "
we took time to relax in the shadow of st eusebius church with a few drinks from arnhems meisje. service was swift and the restaurant is in a good location not far from the hub of the old town. a standard but pleasant experience.
good place to have a drink in the sun. good food that is an ok price. good place to meet someone for lunch.
there are many more restaurants serving poor quality food for regular prices. but here they add abominable service and disrespect for free. what a bummer!
"well what can i tell you about my experience at this cafe bar. firstly i placed two hours parking on the meter a short (spitting distance) from the cafe, at the cost of approximately £5. (not their fault i grant you) we were sat to a table by a friendly waitress, who then walked off as though sitting to the table was all we had come to do. five minutes past and another friendly waitress attended our table and handed us menus and took our drinks order. two lattes please. these duly arrived at our table within an acceptable time, and we had time to browse through the menu. which really was like putting computer binary in front of me, as the whole thing was written in dutch. no translation. i did think im in holland why would they have the menu in english and fair enough i agree, but then a vast majority of the patrons sat around us were also english, all with furrowed brow trying to look like they understood what was written on the menus in hand. (its a point, is al "
"the restaurant has a large terrace which is great during warm days. the card is rather limited which is a pity, just a bit more choice would have made it more pleasurable. very friendly personnel which is a big plus!"
"of all the places ive eaten so far in arnhem, this was one of the most unimaginative places....  too bad.. my grandmother opened this spot............. all 8 of us were looking at each other and shaking our head...."
"as a local i got here with a friend of mine for a beer after we had dinner somewhere else. this is has been an item for years in the city of arnhem, but i wonder for how much longe "
"i have been here with a friend for an informal dinner. it was goed, nothing extraordinary but for sure above the average of a dutch eet-cafè. the veggie burger was awesome! price/ quality was also ok. if you are in arnhem, dont forget to stop here."
"we started off with a mix of small dishes (gozo, sashimi, yakatori) and then i had the fish of the days (sea bass) and my wife had tuna. both fish dishes were ok, but were accompanied only by a small salad garnish and some fried potatoes. so it was a bit boring. but from my experience at eating in arnhem to date, none of the restaurants seem to have imaginative menus."
found this place on tripadvisor and gave it a try as we were in the area. i was totally disappointed. came into the restaurant and the waitress asked what we wanted. a table obviously? service was slow and the food wasnt good. very tiny restaurant/cafe. i dont know why this restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants in arnhem. decided not to go for the main course here and asked for the bill. the staff were eating and didnt want to get up to give us the bill. had to go up to their table to ask. ridiculous. never again. 
the restaurant looks nice but we were lucky not to get a table in the basement. be sure if you book a table. the waiters are more busy talking to their kitchen colleagues than paying attention to the guests. when arriving at 17:15 (we did not book a table)there was a slight panic like they were expecting 100 people. at the time we left 2 hours later the place was not full yet. the food took very long. starter and main course in almost 2 hours.... dishes are average. we had to ask twice for the chefs dishes mentioned on the menu.
"having read the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, we were expecting great things from graave – we were disappoint "
having read good reports about this place we were very dissapoint 
"very nice meal, but terribly slow. 90 minutes to be served an appetizer and hamburger. waiter charming and most helpful in choices."
my wife and i ate here while we were visiting arnhem over the weekend for our trip to national park de hoge veluwe. id specifically picked this restaurant for its rating on tripadviso 
liekd the atmosphere and style. disliekd that i wasnt served within reasonable time. actually just drank and left although i wanted to have dinner.
"urban style restaurant, simple decoration but with good modern atmosphere with yo "
"with friends to sugarhill for a dinner. waiting time (no reservation possible) was around 2hours. we stayed, drinking some beer, as we would like to try this restaurant. when seated we had to wait again too long on the menu card and in the end the food. the food itself was good, but not great. some pieces of the beef were chewy. it is a cosy restaurant. in the end not worthwhile the waiting hours. "
"a remarkable place to hang out and have a nice wine of belgian beer. a very talented chef and very good food. but… i dont like eating there. the dont take reservations, so you just have to wait until a table becomes available. this stresses me out, also because others try to beat you to your turn. the personnel isnt very helpful. upto this point i left 3 times because of this."
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"on monday the 3rd of august my wife and i decided to have dinner at momento. it looked nice and it wasnt very busy, so we expected a quick service. how wrong were we! okay, they were quick with the drinks, but after ordering the food it all went down hill. we ordered a pea soup and beefburger for me and a vegan burger for my wi "
do not trust open hours information. came at 21:00 and they decide to close the kitchen sooner. neither the attendant could explain why. not trustworthy
"we called in to momento for a snack. the restaurant is large, new and very modern. the food was ok and the prices were very reasonable. however, there is no character or atmosphere in the restaurant – it reminded me of eating in a motorway service station café!"
"decent place, ideal when you decide last minute to have dinner with a larger group of friends. large restaurant, but always animate "
we found this place open for dinner within 5 blocks of the city center on a busy evening and it turned out to be more of a tapas style restaurant where you can order a few items to share except it had a limited menu with very entre ite 
"having ordered oyster rockafella to start then pork and salad, i waited 1 hour to have the salad arriv "
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"almost at the center of the beautiful presikhaaf park you find this small restaurant. you can have lunch here outside in the sun or inside if thats what you prefer. the prices are low because some off the staff have an working disability, this sometimes can cause funny situations so know where your going! i find it a very nice place, hope you enjoy it to as well as the park and the small farm for children."
"we arrived to caspar to catch some nice dinner after calling to ask if we could reserve. they said they do not take any reservations but seating two people should not be a problem. we arrived and asked if there was a table, and the waiter instructed us there was a long line. when we asked for an estimate of waiting time he replied: “can’t tell you. it’s a beer cafe so people stay to eat”. i asked if there was any way to estimate the waiting time and the waiter said “can’t tell you”. he proceeded to burp in my face and left."
"we had dinner here once but never again. quality of the food is poor and when we complained about one of the dishes, the servant said: are you a chef or something? no solition offered whatsoever. obviously the dont care about their customers. if you want a great evening go next doors. "
"it was good. the food choice is not extremely various but is very different from any other standard dutch bistrot. mostly vegetarian and unusual dishes (which i liked), the service was just a little slow and some improvement here would be appreciated."
"very good and friendly service, good location. restaurant offers a nice atmosphere, however the burgers are not that goo "
there is no options for people with allergies in their main menus and so we werent able to eat the burger. staff didnt seem faced with it either.  beware of that before you plan your visit
"the place is nice, good ambience but i didnt like the burgers that much. meat was too cooked and expensive for nothing especial."
"range of burgers, certainly no high cuisine. for a burger place not cheap, but much better then burgerking and mcdonalds."
"i have visited iveau burgers and wijn and ordered a gamba burger, which is the most expensive one, because i love prawns and i wanted to have a very nice lunch for my birthday, the price is €16,75 that made sure it was going to be a really tasty and delicious burger, i already had other burgers for less price in other places, so i had big expectations!! "
"after a nice walk in glorious sonsbeek park on the outskirts of arnhem, i went into the city villa, perched beautifully on a parkland hill, for a bite of lunch. its a pleasant place for lunch or for dinner. i sat in the orangerie. id have liked to write a really good review but "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"we came here as a family of four for high tea on mothers day. after being seated, we waited for a full 30 minutes before getting served a small bowl of soup each. another 45 mins later and after asking the server twice when we were getting the next dishes, we finally got our food. the server practically threw the plates on the table and disappeared without explaining what the items were. i overheard another waitress for the table next to us telling the guests what each of the food items were so it was disappointing we werent extended the same courtesy. also our high tea wasnt served on tiered platters as i expected, which detracted from the whole experience. (i asked when we paid why we didnt get our food on the tiered serving platter and the waitress said they ran out of them). we werent asked once during eating if everything was ok, if the food was nice etc. i understand it was busy but this was unacceptable. the service was subpar to say the least. such a pity as the surroundings in the park are beautiful and the food was reasonable. the white asparagus soup was very tasty. we wont be returning."
"the slow stew roasted pork was dry, the tuna was like defrosted tuna from a supermarket and the duck was also dry and i’m not a professional cook but i can cook same food better. i think this restaurant is very overpriced. "
"recently weve had diner with 12 people in one of the separate rooms. the menu was oke, nothing special. it felt like a 13 in a dozen one. at the same time there was a wedding party which they need to serve. we had to do our own drinks, organizing the table setting etc "
"made a reservation for lunch. there happend to be some miscommunication and instead of properly handle it, the staff was rude and not helpful."
busy place on this nice april sunday afterno 
"not a bad place especially when the sun is out on the terrace. it looks ambitious but is a little would be, service very wellwilling but not very experienced and no eye for the table. getting attention for wine and water was really anneffort. food is good but not surprising. price on the high end."
"this lovely spot is no longer accessible for us, as the staff will only give people access if they dine. and if you are in a wheel chair: shame on you, but sorry, can not accomodate you -even on the terrace-! heard this three times on different occasions. a disgrace to arnhem!"
"de boerderij is a very nice location next to the park sonsbeek, in a fabulous surrounding. the restaurant personally visited and known for over 30 years, has changed several times from ownership, management, whatsoever. the quality hasnt been always as superb as it has been in the early days, but this place for its entourage is really worth your visit. nowadays when lucky you can enjoy an excellent dinner ."
"the boerderij is located on the edge of sonsbeek park in arnhem, a truly stunning setting with a great terace for outside dinners, dutch weather permitting. i have had dinner here a couple of times over the last year. the interior is a nice mix between authentic farmhouse features in a contempary design. funny though how the comfortable chairs seem to a few inches too low to sit at the table properly. the staff is an interesting mix between the regular management and some youngster who really try hard. management seem to have lost the real desire to give you a superb guest experience. the menu offers traditional choices, in the autumn often a variety of game. allthough the food is well prepared it is a basic or perhaps i should say safe choice of ingredients. well prepared and good quality, but not very exciting. the weakest part of the experience is the wine list, and the lack of advise. it almost feels as if they are not really interested in wines. yes there is a selection with a choice of spanish wines, but i cannot discover a filosophy. the wines chosen from spanish region are mediocre. the one great bordeaux is the sélection madame du château cantenac 2007, also the only half bottle on the wine list. not a great year and ofcourse far to young to drink. serivce is too matter of factly, not bad but not outstanding. overal a nice place that just doesnt reach its potential."
"the owner refused to let us in. when she saw the two baby pushchairs, it was completely impossible to have lunch. although the restaurant was almost empty. unbelievable..."
"what an old biddy that runs this place. rude beyond description. walked in with my husband and was glared at by some old woman behind the bar. we went in for a coffee. eventually she came over, my husband orders coffee, but i wanted an americano as the coffee is too strong for me. my husband goes up to the counter to change the order and the old bat got flustered beyond belief saying she doesnt speak english. fine...my husband tried to explain in dutch. she wanted none of it. she brings a regular espresso type coffee and then he explains again that perhaps the glass they serve tea in along with some hot water would be possible? she had a dam fit! all the while saying she doesnt speak english and was visibly annoyed. i did end up with more hot water. we did need more milk and my husband went to ask for more. she said she already gave us some and was very annoyed. after we were done, my husband, whose roots are dutch with all relatives being dutch, went up to pay and said nicely in his broken dutch that he was trying to communicate with her in dutch and she was very rude. she said she did not care and he did not know how to act in a restaurant in holland and that dutch is the language of holland and we should know how to speak it. she said she ran the place for 54 years and it was her place and we should learn how to act properly in a restaurant in the netherlands. never have we come across someone so rude. ok that she obviously doesnt like foreigners, but why have a restaurant. time for her to retire. we have never met such a rude individual and our dutch relatives and friends are not even close to this way of thinking. will never ever go back and we hope people will refrain from giving her business. avoid at all costs. she was also visibly rude to other guests that were there."
very bad experience provided by the old lady serving. felt uncomfortable and unwelcome by her. she should retire!
"we wanted to eat at a local place and decided to eat here because the menu at the door looked very enticing. unfortunately the reception was icy and the service was slow and uninterested. got the drinks wrong, meat was well done and not rare. were not offered more drinks or desserts. very disappointing."
we have been here for lunch on the 2nd of january. the staff was friendly and the food was o 
"service was poor, it felt like we were not welcome, but that could also be due the fact that there were only 8 guests in total. the restaurant was a ghost town, and i understand why. the food was the worst, the meat was not even good enough to feed to a dog. you can get better food at the local snackbar. also be aware that no one talks dutch here, so english on "
"let me start off positively. beautiful place, great ambiance. have eaten here 3 times and the quality of the food varies. once everything came together very nicely. all good. but the last time it was a total trainwreck. waited for the food for over 90 minutes, the orders were wrong, service terrible, and the food was below par. the reason/excuse that was given? management (or ownership) had recently changed and things were a bit chaotic. i do not know if that has been cleared up and i wont be back to find out."
"place is nice, food ok but service is a disaster. we went for business lunch with 12 people and we were waiting around 1.5 hours then only 12 meals were delivered and one colleague had to wait another 10 minutes. not recommend for business lunches."
"mothers day lunch with 7 persons, restaurant had 3 other parties besides ours. expectations shot up by the chique welcome and the classic interiors. we were surprised by the special menu which wasnt advertised on their website, however, luckily also the normal menu was also availabl "
weve been here before and were looking forward to a quality dinner. parking is easy and the terrace is well equipped for outdoor dinin 
"villa has a nice convenient location. we came for a romantic dinner and the atmosphere was suitable for a pleasant evening. however, on the terrace there was no designated space for non-smokers and our meal experience was overshadowed by unpleasant and toxic fumes. towards the evening we couldnt see our plates anymore because it got dark and there was no light except one candle per table. the service was exceptionally slow as we got our starters exactly one hour after ordering. after pointing out the delay the staff did not apologize for this inconvenience. we had to ask separately for everything: bread, salt, pepper - as none of that was present at the tabl "
the building is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. the food looked much nicer than it tasted and we expected much more for this high price tag! my meat was tough and hard to chew and some of the other dishes were pretty tasteless. a real disappointment!
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay € 50 each. would not really recommend it."
"we came as a group of 4. restaurant was full. we ordered appetizer and mains together but appetizer never came. in the menu is written that every main course is served with fries and salad but one of the friends didn’t get side dish neither extra side sweet jacket potatoes what he ordered. when we said to waiter that, he explained that they brought only 2 sides not to waste the food?!?!?! after friend ate his steak and only then his sides came. restaurant on pictures advertising small grill which you get on table and you grill by yourself but in reality you get the grill on table with already grilled meat. tenderloin steak was really dry even if it was ordered medium rare and rib eye steak definitely didn’t had more than 200 g and in menu is written 250g. all 4 of us are from catering services and we came without any expectations but whole experience was disappointing. wine was great, service was polite but not on level and prices were good. "
the steaks were good. the concept isnt bad with the small bbqs with your meat in the table . the only issue you get to a certain point that you cant breathe properly anymore with all of the bbq smoke everywhere. it may need a betters ventilation system . however the service was good 
"myself and a number of work colleagues visited last friday, food was standard, there was a variety of dishes that we ordered and all were tasty but nothing spectacular. service was good despite it being such a busy place."
had high expectations for this place but unfortunately was a total disappointment. the steaks didnt have any seasoning whatsoever and no char on the stakes. we ordered side orders which were served after we already finished our meals. staff isnt very friendly. waste of time and money!
visited the restaurant with some friend 
kind of disappointing when they were not busy and we had to wait for 1.5 hours. the ribs were burnt. fish ok.
"we were in a group of 5 and the waiters were helpful with the menu, but we had to wait over an hour for our food and most of our friends said the food was too dry and tasteless (ribs, burger). i ordered a fish and it came out with the head, bones, and skin. head i didnt mind but i didnt particularly like pulling fish bones out of my teeth. overall 2.5"
"we had pretty high expectations, because it doesnt look like an ordinary steakhouse. but the service was terrible and the meat wasnt grilled properly. no knowledge of served wines or whatsoever. and last but not least side dishes were forgotten and wrong sauces were serv "
"on the basis of positive trip advisor reports, dined at vlees last week with 15 friends. we arrived punctually, and were seated promptly. we had agreed in advance that in view of our numbers we would be limited to a choice of two starters, two mains and two desserts. initially service was ok - we ordered starters and wine, which were served in a reasonable time. the garlic soup and carpaccio were both judged to be very tasty. things then ground to a halt, as we waited for our steaks, which despite our chasing arrived a full two hours after we had been seated. during this time several tables around us had arrived, been served, and departed. most of our steaks were cooked as requested, although not very hot, but my medium rare ribeye was seriously overcooked, and had to be sent back and replaced ( another 10-minute wait!) eventually, some three hours after our arrival, we finished our meal, and paid the bill. no apology was given for the dreadful service, and we were disappointed to be charged for our bread, which we only ordered to keep us going during the long wait for our steaks. overall our dining experience was extremely disappointing and fell a long way below our (high) expectations. the food was (eventually) ok, but the slow service, and particularly the poor management response, left a lot to be desired!"
"great food (try their amazing bitterballen) and beer. unfortunately, there wasnt an english menu and not all the waiters were able to translate some things to us. our orders got lost twice, so it took more time than expected to get our food."
"the food selection is very wierd, difficult choices and no simple stuff like a torsie or broodje kroket. secondly there are no heathy things on the menu. the most healthy choice coms with gefrituurde kip. sometimes owners choose funny choices to stand out but sometimes simplicity rules!! also thh no e restaurant was cold. i wanted to work but went home instead "
nce location to sit and have drinks with friends. the restaurant is situated central of arnhem. is next to the bus stop and 5 minutes walking from the train station.
the staff sometimes cannot see the customers and let them wait so long. the cheese platter is not suitable for non-dutch people. cocktail is okay.
"the glass of my boyfriends favorite beer got smaller. the waiter explained that it didnt, but it did get significantly smaller and the price was the same，but we still spend over 100 euros to show our love，the most crazy thing was that when we walked out of the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted to go back and use the restroom, the waiter at the door said he was not allowed to enter the restaurant because he was not dressed nicely ( he was wearing his errea sweatpants and we just spent over 100 💶 there) we’re so sad and disappointed, bye bye stan "
"the food was top notch, the sevice was terrible, im guessing by other reviews this does not happen oftern, but it happened to me. i will not go to much into the weeds, as this place had great food, but i had little to no service, left for ages to eat, no follow up, food missing, my order was not as requested, waitied ages for bill, gave up and just went to pay my bill. told the young chap about my experinace, apoliges for the bad service, asked do you think he should speak to his manager, silance and nothing, gave up. if this was a training week for staff, i hit it bang on, shocking service, but im guessing a one off."
"not sure why it was crowded. ok the quality if the drinks are not bad, but pricy and services is bit arrogant"
"this place has everything to make it great. location, great food and drinks, nice ambiance. the whole letdown for me is the service. they always seem understaffed and the staff that is there seems to lack the capability of seeing what needs to happen. forgotten drinks, forgotten menus, forgotten empty glasses. such a shame. could be ten out of ten, but is marked down for the service."
very popular bar/restaurant. the main highlight is definitely the huge patio. the coffee was good. the food selection isn’t mouth watering.
"the service was great. the place was super busy. the pretzel app was good. i had the paella and it was...well it was awful. had the place not been so busy i would have sent it back. it was so dry it was actually crispy on the top (rice, mussels, and salad shrimp) and mushy inside. "
"had dinner with friends on a friday evening, seems to be a combination between a cafe/bar and a restaurant...it was very crowdy. friendly staff, good food (had a steak), restaurant itself also looks very nice (the way its designed, decorated)."
"central to all amenities, lovely ambience, love the buzz of the crowd, but alas i found the presentation of food, and the price lacking, even too expensive for what it was.  the service could also be more friendly, we dont owe them anything!"
"it has been the talk of the town, but the quality has certainly not gone up since the beginning. service was with a great smile this time, but the surf & turf burger was nothing special on a not totally fresh bun. its all ok, but you would expect mo "
"on a good location one can find this fashionable café / restaurant. there’s a lot of choice in hot and cold beverages, cakes and food. and a nice variation in seati "
i went to stan and co with a colleague for a working lunch. our table was very close to those next to us so we felt rather penned in. the place was bustling at lunchtim 
"a new place in arnhem in an old bank building. great location and design. nice atmosphere. it is very noisy, so i would not go there for an evening out dining with intimate tabletalk! food is ok, very suitable for a quick bite or drinks with friends if you are on your way to the cinema or theatre. the service at the table was very friendly, the lady receiving us and leading to the tables had her off day. "
"the ambience is amazing, the club sandwich fish was equally amazing. i like that i was able to choose between soy and oat milk. in general all good...but the owner genuinely needs to scold her staff in private, it is beyond awkward to have to listen to when having a romantic lunch."
"this little patio has a great atmosphere. you can sit here to hide from the sun or rain. it is a cosy place. so for a dink, perfe "
"this is seriously the worst service mcdonalds of all time. slow, slow , slow...food almost always cold ....and rarely do they get the order right! its mindboggling that they get it wrong so often. this week i went there three times..and yep, they got the order wrong all three times..i guess its difficult to distinguish between coffee and tea. always 2- 3 managers  working at one time, but literally doing nothing. if you go through the drive thru, be prepared to wait forever..its quicker to fly to america then get your order here this way...and good luck getting what you actually ordered...this is the worst mcdonalds ever!"
"we visited the restaurant on a sunday evening. when we arrived at 17.30 it was still quiet but when we left at 20.30 it was packed. the interior is trendy and warm. i liked it a lot. cosy atmosphere, interesting men "
"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress über-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
"we ordered our food before we came and waited 1,5 hour for it. it took 45 minutes before they let us order our drinks and then the food came separately. very bad experience"
"we visited fika several times. if you want to have a good coffee in nijmegen , in my opinion this is a very good place to start. they have a very good coffee blend from a nijmegen roastery. along with the coffee we had a brownie - not recommended, it was like a piece of shoe sole... the personnel is okay, but nothing special. the place itself is not very nice, but is central. it tries to get a bit of a swedish style, but is just a place where the owners didnt want to invest money and this is why this location is missing the atmosphere... no background music, no colours for the walls, some basic metallic shelves (by basic, i really mean basic-like that the people putting in their garages or basements), white tiles on the wall like in a communist butcher shop. pity, this place could be something much more than that with a few more money spent for improvements - some pale neutral colours on the walls, some new industrial style shelves for the bar, some new design lamps, some music... "
"we got 3 of what they call smorrebrod on a menu with shrimp, ossenhaas and tuna. all three were very good sandwiches, but clearly the owner/cooks/waiters have no idea what a smorrebrod actually is. so food is good, but not as advertised. we had to wait more than 40 min for sandwiches. coffee was good"
"after shopping and ice skating we met at le duc for an afternoon snack. the place is clean and looks friendly comfortable. 3/5. the service is efficient and friendly. 4/5. we ordered green pea soup 3/5, bitterballen set 4/5, tok tok (chicken nuggets + fr. fries.) 3/5, white wine 4/5, green tea 3/5."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.
there are a lot of great restaurants in nijmegen. this is not one of th 
had late evening drinks here the other evening very busy one young girl serving outside working super hard and not looking like she was enjoying her shift long wait for service as you might expect good wine when it came though
"overall not fantastic customer service, but the worst of all is the incredibly long wait. 1h15m for 2 sandwiches while the table sitting next two totalled nearly 2 hours of wait. won’t come again."
"bad experience, you could finish your master degree norwegian or any other study between order and the show up of your order. apologies for the long waiting, but organisation on terrace was far below standard. one for bringing the orders, one for taking the orders, not doing anything else. resulting in endless waiting. unbalance in price versus quality, leaning over to price. a disgrace to nijmegens hospitality"
waited 40 minutes before even being asked if we ant anything and after that another hour on food.. not worth the wait or the money
last day in nijmegen after a wonderful long weekend. ordered food half an hour later was told one of the dishes was out. when it eventually arrived the schnitzel was too salty. fish was like a minnow as opposed to a sole!! at the end they didn’t accept credit or debit cards. no notice at all when you enters or ordered. most unhelpful staff
"not great - also doesn’t take card payments (except for maestro whatever that is), which is not made clear beforehand"
"the service was very slow. from the beginning to end of our three course meal, we waited a long time. even when our carafe of water was long finished, we waited to be asked if we wanted more water or more wine. i finally stopped the waiter and asked for more water. the wait to order was 15 minutes. the wait for the first course was 45 minutes! then another 30 minutes(at least) for the main course. we were never asked if everything was ok; there simply was no check in with us. it was indeed a very busy night for them, but they should have been prepared for valentines evening as it was fully booked! the starter was good. we had the salmon and carpaccio. the main was luke warm and fair. we had the choc. creme brulee dessert which was far too sweet. the lobs of white choc on top was an addition of sugar that was not necessary and in my opinion no added value to the dessert. a raspberry or strawberry on top would have sufficed. we were recommended by locals to dine here. i am sorry to say, that i will choose differently next time i am in nijmegen."
"a cocktail bar that does not have tequila is shocking! the bar service was bad but the restaurant was top class and the rooms were clean. the business meetings went well but it support for audio and video was really bad. all together, i would give this hotel 5 out of 10."
olround bowling restaurant is a bowling alley with attached restaura 
we went here to have lunch with the family group. we had ordered drinks beforehand and unfortunately after waiting a long time my cousin received a lukewarm coffee and my other cousin had to ask twice for his beer. as it wasnt included when the drinks were brought to our tab 
"really nice location in the middle of nijmegen but the standard of food is dissapointing. i ordered the hamburger, the patty tasted like it was bad quality store bought, the bun was dry and old,the tomatoes were old and some items off the menu werent available."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"the location is great, the beer pretty good, the food average to poor, but the service is terrible. ive been here a few times and either ive left because i didnt get any attention from the waiting staff, or ive stayed and had a series of forgotten orders, or unattentive waiters in general. such a shame on this nice of a location.

i didnt manage to get the attention of any of the three servers so i left. waited for about 10 minutes
"usually, i have no complaints about this place. i really enjoy the beer tastings they do. the outside terrace is the most gorgeous one in the city. service is usually fast. however, we reserved this placed for our wedding reception for 25 people and it did not go so well... we booked the place more than a month upfront, spoke to a very nice and fast waiter who was supposed to be working at our wedding. on the wedding day, he was not there though, we got some guy who looked like he was working there for the first day. some guests never got their orders and after 20 minutes of waiting had to go inside to order again and bring the drink from the bar themselves. additionally, we ordered a big cheesecake for everybody (again, more than a month in advance). we were reassured every one of our guests will have cake. when we asked for it at the reception the waiter said that they dont have enough cake left and he knows nothing about the order. we waited for more than 1 hour 30 min until the cake was finally brought ( i guess they were baking it or buying it elsewhere). the cake was not decorated nicely, just served plain white on a white plate. usually, it is decorated. and to top it all off-the bill was wrong. they overcharged us!!! usually, a nice place with friendly and quick personnel. however, when they know they have to cater for a wedding-everything seems to go wrong. just awful. we felt ashamed in front of our guests for such poor service at our reception."
"the building is fantastic. de commanderie van st. jan is a medieval building in the center of nijmegen. there are different restaurants to choose in this building.(de hemel, plaats 1) and some other food related businesses. we had lunch in de hemel (the heaven). i chose the goats cheese salad. it was okay. nice cheese, some bacon and lettuce, with some dressing. there were a lot of tomatoes and cucumber without any dressing. the cucumber was dried out. as as said, the scenery is great, so next time ill try the other restaurant."
"i had dinner here and took the 8 course meal. i started with the bread and tapenade which was good. second round was the soup which was delicious. the next 5 dishes were fish and meat. with the fish, i could taste that it was fish from the freezer and not fresh, the meat was not cooked well. the waiters were very nice. i know that the price is not high (eur 28) but using more fresh ingredients would really improve the taste and quality of this restaurant."
"i went here for a lunch. the terrace outside is really beautiful. some of the waiters smile. this is the only good part of this place. we only ordered 2 drinks, a small lunch and one second drink. we were with 2 people. inside it was fully packed, the terrace was not even filled for one quarter. there were many waitresses. still they managed to forget the 2nd drink twice (we had to order one drink 3 times), forgot our lunch and when the sandwiches arrived (after re-order) the crockets were cold and the meat of the hamburger was cold. their excuse: it is very busy in the kitchen at the moment. so, do not go there when the weather is nice and the terrace is fully pack "
"me and my friends had dinner here and order the menu of 28,50 ( 8  course meal) which exists of meat sliced of a sword a little soup and salad, it took us 4 hours to from start to end a very very long time, the food was cooked, the pork rose and the fries very very salty - will definitely not go back here!! bad experience, been heer 8 years back (another owner then and then ik was great) - but in 2013 and up dont bother !! the beer however is super try it!"
"humphreys nijmegen recently moved to a new location. i always had good experiences at the old location. the new restaurant looks nice, but the service was a disaster! unpersonal, incompetent and slow. the restaurant is understaffed and the staff isnt well train "
had a three course dinner each for 27.95. we really were not impressed. good bread and dessert but the main dish of a mix grill and chicken was really bad. would not go back! over cooked and it didnt even match the description in the menu.
"straight forward reasonable priced meal, nothing bad and nothing extra ordinary.   lovely positioned by the river and staff very, very good, attentive, friendly and service minded."
"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
"especially in summer this restaurant is the place to be, visited by village people and tourists. you can enjoy sunshine until ± 20:00 hr "
"large portions but not very good food. 12 ribs but dry. small, overcooked mussels in watery sauce. salad mainly iceberg lettuce. do yourself a favour and walk a minute further to it posthuswhich which does much better quality for similar price."
"this is located on a nice square in makkum.   the food is average, a typical dutch menu so little imagination.  its ok if you need somewhere to eat."
"for dinners with a eur 18-20 tag i would expect well good food. however overcooked steak (medium was requested), schnitzel was soggy of oil (not crisp) and plate was floating of the oil the potatoes was cooked in. however there are carrots and a salad as a side dish, so plenty of food. "
"food in makkum is pretty much the same, wherever you go...some places do some things better than others. this place has huge portions (normal around here) but they arent terrific. it is a good place to hang out, have drinks & people watch. the best staffmember is angelique, shes super friendly, fun, and genuinely cares about her customers. sime of the others could use an attitude adjustment! but you can usually find a table outside to sit in the sun, & the beer/wine is good."
"we stopped here one evening for a quick bite to eat. we found a table outside and were quickly served with our drinks - i had the enigmatically named wieckse witte wheat beer. the waitress who took our order was friendly enough but seemed to have her mind on other things. my order of plaice arrived without the special request for extra chips and it took some time to get any cutlery. the food was luke warm at best. my companion decided only to go for the tomato soup and hot chocolate with a pile of cream on top. that was ok, she said. with a bill close to 30 euro i wasnt really that impressed. next time we eat in makkum well try one of the other restaurants..."
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
"went here for a lunch/snack. paid a total of €12,55 for 2 medium sized portions of fries and 2 snacks. after almost 30 minutes our fast food arrived. it looked like small portions of fries but the lady ensured me this was normal. also the berehap snack which is known for being a big snack fitted in a small frikandel-sized cart "
had to go here due to the only other real good fish snack bar being closed. this will be the last visit here as well. i didnt like the very fluffy kibbeling ( not crunchy) at all.
"the food is not fantastic but reasonable priced. the people running are quitte blunt and seemed to be stressed, overworked. on a sunny day there is a serious line at a window where you have to order and pay. and although there is stated you can pay by bankcard (pin) and cash, i would strongly advice cash. the mobile network is for some reason in that place very very bad, sometimes your mobile gives no connection and their bankcard system is depending on it...so you would not be the first that walks away empty handed after a 15 min wait. is not helping the atmospher "
it is very nice to sit outside and watch the shoppers pass by at the plaza. food is not remarkable and often close to dutch snacks but it is a good place to be.
"i live in the area and pop into this restuarant from time to time. ive always found the food good, the wasabi mayonaise burger is pretty good and i found the lamb rack really really go "
bad food and no vegetarian dishes and when they were willing to amend a plate they had run out of pasta/rice. my salad with marinated beef wasnt tender at all. not going there a second time for dinner.
"this typical amsterdam snack shop sits exactly on the border of amsterdam and amstelveen. it has the usual selecton of inexpensive dutch snacks and nibbles, as well as warm and cold sandwhiches, including burgers and chicken sandwiches. there is a lovely patio if the afternoon sun is shining, otherwise it has small indoor seating, or a walk-up/carry-out counter. there is free parking on one side, pay parking on the other. plenty of space for bicycles. very close to then entrance of the amsterdamse bos (amsterdam forest)."
"i love surinamese food. this is simply not it. wrong flavours, bad ingredients, and not fresh. its the only surinamese place in the area, that is all it has going for it."
it only takes one bad experience with a cashier to make you never darken the door again. seriously after years of going i will find another cafe in the area.
"unpolite service, tasteless ingredients and terrible pizza. greasy cheese and soggy base. not recommended."
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill 
"fantastic food and service generally friendly, but made several mistakes with the orders and as a result we had a very long wait for our meal without any recognition.  a shame as the food was excellent."
"food was ok, nothing outstanding, specially considering the pric "
june 5th we had a special celebration and our first choice restaurant was closed so we decided to go to de jonge dikkert as friends had recently recommended the fo 
"as i live close to this beautiful restaurant, ive been to this restaurant regularly. as i really liked the atmosphere and quality of the food, i booked this restaurant for a business meeting. what a disappointment it was. first of all, not all food was properly cooked, leaving me with a semi-raw langoustine. second of all, one of the waiters a) didnt at all know what he was serving and b) didnt have a clue about the accompanying wine and finally staff my dietary request was completely forgotten when serving the cheese platt "
i can only describe our experience as very disappointi 
"when we arrived we were greeted courteously, but then we were seated somewhere away in a corner, although we had reserved. so we asked to be moved as we like to soak up the atmosphere. the atmosphere was really good, relaxed and its easy to have a conversation. the tables are also nicely spread out so that you dont have the feeling that someone can listen into your conversati "
"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.
we went to this place for lunch and had okay-ish pancakes. location is perfect for a break while shopping in the mall.
had lunch here earlier this week with my best frie 
super slow service which is amazing for a shopping center restaurant.  more for snacks than a meal.  the rose beer was good.

the coffee is okay however the big plus are restroom facilities which are in short supply in this center.  a good place to catch up with friends
place is packed with people and youd have to get your kids to eat their pancakes while standing. pancakes themselves are nice but not thrilling ( quite fattening ).
"the pancakes are great, well cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! the bacon cheese is very good and so is the spicy..they offer gluten-free pancake (if you order in the morni "
a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."
since years the quality of food is abominabl 
for first time since 2 years ordered the pancakes. my husband ordered qp me 
because of the covid closure we decided to order the dinerbox from aan de po 
a two michelin-star rated restaurant has to be really impressive. this restaurant only impressed in price. the portion sizes were ridiculously small. the chef even came out and told us at the start the portions would be small! i guess we could have left then. the food quality was good but at these prices and quantities i would take the nearby jonge dikkert any day!
to be honest - we expected much more. the chefs menue looked fantastic and we started off with a beautiful raw kingfish dish. after that flavours became a bit flat with as major disappointment the eel with foie and appel which was just too much together - made u think of pancake with bacon and apple. staff was nice and chefs personal attention was well received.
"made reservations with american express centurian months earlier. we were seated at the darkest table next to the door with no view. waitress approached the table and asked if e wanted and an aperitief, a glass of wine or a cocktail. i asked for a specific vodka on the rocks and my husband a martini. waitress responds with we can make hers but we cant make a martini(why offer a cocktail) (what?). then, all of a sudden someone found our reservation and moved us to a better table (we didnt say a word about the first one). serving staff plopped down the amuse bouche, but couldnt be bothered to explain indetail. if youre putting it on the plate, tell me why it should be there, or if too confusing, leave it off. the young woman who was the sommelier was very informative and helpful on the other hand. food. dissapointing at best. eaten at le bernadin and latelier de joel rubuchon, where the late chef roubuchon came and talked to us about his food, amoung many starred restaurants and this was disappointing. poor discriptions and very little harmony in the ingrediants. take the smoked eel. long strip of eel drapped across a bowl (why so much). and a little glob of foie gras in the middle. foie is so delicate the eel totally over whelmed it. no respect for the ingrediants. my husband felt the poor service was because we werent local, but why should that matter in a 2 starred restaurant. staff needs better training in service, like what the meaning of the word is, and kitchen needs to tighten up, less ingrediants to confuse, just let the product sing on its own! would not recommend. "
"for this is a fine dining restaurant, i expected a warm welcome, attentive service, and excellent food. in the whole dining, i couldnt not find a waiter or waitress to give me a smile. the tone was robotic and efficient as if we were in a fast food chain store: “please eat and g "
had to wait for ages and didnt think the food was great.... and for those prices!!! staff i thought were also rude which made it all in all not a good choice for a family birthday meal.
"food is of course good and beautifully displayed in this 2-star michelin restaurant. nice terrace, too bad there were no white table cloths on the black tables. we also found the staff to be a bit underdressed (jeans and sneakers). staff did whatever they needed to do correctly but nothing more. too bad the high-and-mightiness that seems to be typical for many upscale restaurants in and around amsterdam, also found its way to aan de poel."
"the restaurant was pretty busy for wednesday evening, but seems more the business and show off people. food was ok, has a feeling as invention stopped some time ago and a menu formula was a novelty. some dishes were very well presented, one was really delicious (blackened entrecôte). so at the end i would recommend to have there st jacques and entrecôte. and menu especially the 6 dish is exaggerated - especially in price (think it goes to 90 euros). we did not like the interior and the artificial flowers (in the netherlands?!!) are too cheap for that type of restaurant. there are better places - even very close het bosch , which i have visited many times is beating it easily "
"good food with reasonable price. however, the service and tempo are not worth the two star at all. we wait for almost one hour for dessert and the four courses set took us 160 mins...it also took more than 10 mins to get check. its a truly awful experience and i wont visit again for sure."
we went to the restaurant 4 people. drank a lot of wine and paid the bill without studying it closely. later on we discovered that we were charged for 5 people instead of 4 for the 5-course dinner that we ha 
"we reserved an outside table at this restaurant on one of the hottest days of the summer. in the afternoon before our visit the staff called to confirm our reservation. we confirmed and because of the nice weather we specifically asked again for an outside table, which was said to be no proble "
"i can be real short on this one: rude and unfriendly service, acceptable food, nice location. please stay away."
"we had very high expectations but nothing was special about the restaurant, service was below average far from 2 michelin star standards, service people was having an otiose arrogance, food was nothing special, dressings of food was good but taste was not that special, ambiance is also nothing special"
"rude staff, i do not recommend this restaurant.  there are many other great options close by.  stopped by on a tuesday evening and have never had a worse experience."
"went with pretty high hopes and recommendations. went well on arrival, champagne and oysters on beautiful terrace, but then nothing. sat for 30 mins with empty glasses. chased down a waiter who sent someone to our table and we asked for a glass of wine that would go with the first course. nothing for another 20 mins and i had to chase down a waiter again. i actually asked if there was something wrong because there seemed to be a swarm of confused looking staff but no service. no apology, no understanding of our situation, in fact, their answer was about having 80 covers and it being difficult when everyone moves from outside terrace to inside. hmm, made to feel i shouldnt have complained. wont be going back here. made me feel i was in a chain restauran "
"if it were just for the taste of the food i would definitely recommend aan de poel. we had the 6 course alliance menu recommended by the chef and all dishes were very tasty, with simple ingedients and not too molecular. only down side with the menu was that the portions remained very small, and even for a tiny person like me, i was quite hungry after all amuses, starters and mains, so i had to order some extra cheese. i have never experienced this in a michelin star restaura "
we were checking out this place to celebrate our honeymoon party in december. so we were sitting on the bar and ordered a beer. then they told us we could not get a drink on the bar if we were not also eating. so we told our story that we were checking out the place and we also would like to see the menu. then they told us friendly to leave....
"the food was beautiful. all the flavours went together marvelously. we had the 6 course seasonal menue. however, after having spend a lovely evening, we were shocked when the valet told us that our car was broken into! in the restaurants parking lot and under their supervision. the thief stole my working laptop in the trunk. very unfortunate event, the security should have been tighter, especially since they told us it was the second time within a year that this had happened."
"after a great time here in 2010 we went back. this time the food and service were of much lower quality. the price / quality ratio is not ok. no really outstanding dishes as before. service is often slow and not really professional. at the end the bill had several errors. correcting the bill took very long, while we had indicated to be in a hurry. the waiter even let the new bill wait at his desk and went to bring drinks to other guests, before handing us the bill. all the time we were waiting at the exit. very rude. we had a bad experience."
access for tourists via public transport (ov or openbare vervoer) is difficult. but well worth the effort for the succulent and unlimited (onbeperkt) spareribs - a backpackers paradi 
"the first thing we got told: no, you cannot sit at your prefered table because then i have to walk too much. that set the scene for the evening: every cause was delivered with some error, drinks missing for the apéritif, bread missing with the starter, fries missing with the main meal, the fries finally arrived after asking twice and when we all had finished the me "
"the place is really very average, the amuse we got tasted very much like supermarket spreadable sausage that was a bit dressed up. the starter of ossenworst ( spiced raw beef) tartaar conceptionally was interesting but the final result turned out to be a bit of the traditional ossenworst with some dressing on t "
"to begin with the most positive: beautiful location, nice quiet atmosphere. but thats it unfortunately. the concept is unclear: starters and main course are tiny (even for a starter!). so after two courses a healthy stomach is certainly not satisfied. the quality was not convincing. my tuna looked like chewing gum, the pork belly was nearly all fat. apart from that, the prices are really high compared to what is being offered. perhaps kronenburg is the restaurant for tourists who are willing to pay the price but as a citizen of amstelveen i must conclude that there are better and less expensive restaurants to go to."
"perhaps it was the fact that we were a very large group that caused the food to be a disappointment. the first impressions of the kronenburg are very favourable- a stylish exterior and a spacious, quality interior. the place has that air of quality about it. unfortunately the food was largely uninspiring. a decent carpaccio of scallops was a good start but the duck (tough) and hare (very tough) did nothing for the palate. an anonymous ice cream based pudding also lacked any substance or taste. i am sure the quality of food is better than we experienced but it may better when the groups are not so large."
"i reviewed this restaurant on 12 november 2015 and at that time was pleasantly surprised. however our recent visit was a disappointment, especially for the service rendered. the food was not bad, but also nothing to brag about. for a refill of our wine, we had to ask three or four times. the appetizer came in a reasonable time, but for the main course, i had to get up and inquire what happened to our order. when it finally came it was just above room temperature. we were not in the mood anymore for a desert."
food was good but unremarkable. the young waiter was perhaps just a bit too eager to please- pushed us for chips and wine when we had indicated that we were happy with our order choice. venue was quite smart with welcoming staff at the front desk. overall fine for a quick business lunch so would go again.
"had a great evening here with good friends one of them having a glut allergy. after a poor amuse (courgette kerry cake), a nice tuna tartar, a tasty lobster / steak, followed by a good looking desert. however, glut free coffee sweets were not available in spite of an upfront reservation. service friendly, fine ambiance with lots of space. overall a nice experience but could be better ..."
"the location is good.. a man made lake and green trees, with an outside terrace and a cozy minimalist modern interior design... but the food was the turn down.. ive been to hundreds of different restaurants in netherlands but this one is my absolute dissapointment.. taste is bland and plain, no beauty in the food presentation, size is unimpressive.. overall so dissapointing.. loetje should take over this restaurant and use the awesome location and building.."
"the location is the only thing that enjoyable while i dont know why there are many waitresses there serving food that wasnt even deserve to be called food.. tasteless, amount is like starter for a main course and dessert that looked like it can be bought in supermarket and no efforts of art put in it whatsoever "
"the good and quick behavior of the room staff cannot mask the low capability of the kitchen: the grilled mix is not grilled at all, the french fries are not french at all, the vegetarian dishes are not attractive..."
"menu and decor and staff all the same. pleasant waiters, easy wine, no advise with combi food and wine. food is simple and ok. close to hotel and around the area not much other choice"
"nice is quite nice. nice and friendly waitress and the food was nice.  nothing super special just quick, ok food at a very reasonable price."
i had watered-down onion soup with a cheese bread topping that you couldnt bite i 
"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "
place looks quite nice but limited menu. not very busy but still they managed to forget to bring veg with mail course. ruined the meal. i used to go before the rebranding and reopening but never again. owners need to check and train staff. our table were not the only ones having issues that evening...

ive been year for a dinner with some collegues during a business trip in amstelv 
"this restaurant is next to the grand hotel in amstelveen (less than a minute walk) and is basically the only place to eat when you dont want to go somewhere else by car or taxi. service and food are good, but nothing really outstanding. its perfect for a quick dinner after a long day of work. staff speaks fluentl english, so easy also for foreign guests."
"this bistro may be nice, but not more than that. it seems to cater mainly to visitors of the nearby hotel (no restaurant of its own) and of the sports complex as there is nothing else around. i gu "
"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
ive visited this place several times and yesterday was the worst out of a 
"after the starters we have to see the whole restaurant getting food but us. after informing at a waiter he said it would be there in a minute, after 10 minutes we informed at another waiter who actually went to the kitchen. we saw about 40 people getting served (also people who entered the place much later) before we finally got the main course. they were just in time, we were about to lea "
"nice place to be, i think its mostly after work drinks and diner. diner is good, but not surprising. its pub like / eetcafé. waitresses are experienced and understand their job."
"after a walk we ended up here for a drink. ordered also vegetarian burger that was disappointed. it was not fresh prepared, they fried and not baked. the salad with it was tasteless and almost no dressing the french fries where to hard. in bother words very disappointing for 12 euro. the service was friendly "
you have never ever seen ribs this size and they are like something from the flint stones. good food and value for a family.  not gone fine dining. but worth a visit if youre very hungry!
this place has been the same ever since i first visited it in 2003. nothing really changed on the inside or the menu. still i am going back there several times a year just because it is what it is. famous for its sate and nothing more. it is really good thoug 
"this eatery is totally devoid of any sophistication. the entourage is chaotic rather than cosy, and the staff indifferent rather than inattenti "
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
"group of 6 visited this eatery, 2 of us didn’t get what we ordered and 3/6 plates were mostly served with cold fries, the chicken burger was scraggy bits of chicken thighs put together it was unpleasant. service was poor and they only agreed to take one meal off the bill. very disappointing."
"it was a lunch time (23.03.2022) and i entered the place and waiter was near me cleaning the table and i kindly asked for the menu. he answered you have just entered sit and wait and i said ok. it wasnt problem at all, the problem was that when he brought the menu he just literally threw it infront of me. when i left he asked, dont you order, i told no. he told very good, byeeee. will never visit that place again."
regularly visit this bar as its in a nice location in the stadhart. its a really nice place but the staff can be so slow. all nice people but keep your head up and look out for customers who need service. have sat down in this bar and waited up to 15 minutes trying to get the staffs attention. head up and look after your customers
"we sat on the terrace outside as we wished to catch some fresh air after shopping. unfortunately not much space in the sun, but i am sure there is in the summer. we had some wines which were of a nice quality and shoestring fries. they were spiced with some cajun herbs if i am not mistaken. very nice place to sit, relax and have some drinks and bites! "
"pretty good food but terrible service- slow, unfriendly, no english menu, not enough and veryyyy slow service."
"went there for lunch. the food is good, however very disappointed with the service. we were with a 1yr old and were placed in one of the booths. so far, so good. they were helpful in providing high chair etc. however when they brought over our hot beverages and in particular a cup of hot water (tea) our waiter nearly served it over the head of our little one. of course this scared us and we asked him to please not serve it over the little one and to be careful. his reply was that it will be fine and that accidents actually happen when people tried to help him. in other words, he ended up serving it over the little ones head and ignored to acknowledge that accidents can happen, except when caused by others. this reckless attitude truly threw us off. we only stayed because it was lunch time for our little one and didnt want the hassle to look for another place. but we will never go back again!!"
the ambiance is that of an american diner just more tasteful. it was very busy at lunch time being the autumn holidays. ordered a thai beef salad which was excellent. the burfger with a bun less exciting. the service very good - a very charming waitress. great staff. worth a visit if you go shopping there. we would go back.
a place for some drinks and a quite interesting menu offering from sandwiches to main continental dishes. service is very attentive and sitting outside is pretty enjoyable but the interiors are a little dark though....
great food and atmosphere in the middle of the shopping area. this is a nice place to grab a coffee or enjoy your drinks in between or after shopping.
"we went here for a pre-theater dinner, hoping that 1.5 hours would more than enough for a 2-course dinner. it wasnt. we only had a main course and had to wait an hour to get it. then we had to wolf it down, skip dessert and run to make the theater in time. we had to remind the waiter 3 times, but he said it is coming right up - while it wasn "
during a sunny shopping afternoon we dropped down on the nice terrace of this caf 
after having done some apparently necessary shopping in the shopping- mall of amstelv 
"came here for dinner with friends and was really disappointed in the quality of the food - i ordered chicken sate with fries, fries were undercooked and ironically the chicken overcooked making it taste like rubber..... the restaurant is nicely located in the center of amstelveen, so pop in for a drink but stay away from the food."
went for lunch with my son one day and didnt have the best experience ever. this used to be a nice hangout with okay food (pretty okay for the type of hangout) but it really has gone do 
"we stepped in for lunch. the place looks quite attractive and modern and has quite a lot of tables as well as an outside terrace. although the rather young staff does its best, for some reason you just keep waiting to be served. no problem if it were actually worth the wait... which it is not. the menu is limited and the food is really distasteful. even the glasses of mineral water were served in visibly dirty glasses. an experience well below average. the price is not, though. much better places are only a few feet away."
i recently visited grand cafe oude dorp and the fact it was completely empty on a thursday mid morning raised alarm bells. it did get gradually busier but that only amounted to about 4/5 tables being occupied. my friend and i were served by a surly waitress who seemed bothered by our presence despite being the only customers in the restaurant and when i found a hair in my salad (that needless to say did not belong to me) she merely told me she’d bring me another plate. no apology was made and we were left well alone until we decided to get up to pay for our brunch. the food itself quite tasty and fairly generous in portion sizes but my friend and i both vowed never to go back there.
"right from the start the server just did not want to serve us. never smiled from entrance to leaving the restaurant. we questioned our bill at the end as we didnt believe we got an extra fries but there was 3 portions in two bowls, figure that one out... we would come back for the food but will stay well clear because of the service. life is to short and there are too many choices of good restaurants in the area."
"went there for a dinner, sat outdoor- nice view of oud dorp - and had an enjoyable meal. the menu offer a variety of dishes from snacks, vegan to international cuisine. i had spare ribs that were good. a good selection of wines an beers also availab "
"a place where you should pick anything fancy from the menu. the slibtong, sole was below average. the simple dishes were ok"
"the café is located in the old part of amstelveen, close to the poel lake and city hall. its décor is somewhat dark, which comes across as 70s style, however the seating is spacious and comfortable. no problem to have a quiet/confidential conversatio "
never ever going there again . i asked for a small portion of food (from kids menu) because i had recently a surgery and i cannot eat a lot . of course the “boss” how waiter called him was really rude and couldn’t accept this . in this way you can’t keep the customers happy !! never ever come back here and i’m not recommend to no one . 
"poor quality for what you get, i was waiting 15minutes inside for someone to ask what i would like to drink or eat, they had like 6-7 people on the tables. my wife had a gastric sleeve surgery and she asked if she can get kids menu, the owner come and said you have to order from adults. waiters and owner very rude, avoid this place"
"club sandwich was not filled or spreaded at the edges, bread was soooo dry i hurt my mouth, 1 slice of bacon and one of the thinnest smoked chicken ham slice i ever saw."
"rude approach from unfriendly and unprofessional personnel. we arrived with about half an hour delay, apologizing because of that, and with 4 people instead of the planned 6 (and again, we gave our apologies). the tone of the waiter who welcomed us was aggressive and sarcastic, and he made us feeling quite uncomfortable, especially because it was a business lunch with our customer. the food was average, nothing special. i will definitely not recommend this place, there are better options in the area of schiphol oost."
"they were unable to provide individual bills although the reservation was made for more than 15 people. of course announced at checkout. no apologies and quite aggressive tone. obviously they dont care as the only choice in this area is the steigenberger hotels restaurant or them. its a pity as the food is quite good (even if we have been waiting one hour!). please change the way you are handling you guests, guys!"
"recently had lunch here with a business partner. in all fairness, the location is great and it has a lot of historic feeling to it, the restaurant is inside the former control tower of the old schiphol airport part, where it all started. however, the lunch was so so. the onion soups we ordered were a little watery and also the cheese did not have that nice thick and grilled layer that one expects of onion soups. both our sandwiches were average, we had a grilled brie sandwich and a grilled goat cheese sandwich. they were served with a lot of bread but not in balance with the amount of cheese. so, either provide more cheese or provide less bread. i would prefer the first, and would be prepared to even pay more for that. i also noticed that the brie was slightly overgrilled, so that could also improve. did not try other things, i think i will give it a second chance and try some other stuff, and see if they have improved. judging by the crowd, maybe it was just a bad experience from our side, as there were many guests in any case. service was nice and friendly, and that also made up for the average food experience."
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
the service is absolutely appalling. i’ve been sat here for an hour and only been asked what i want to drink.   if you want good / fast service then go else where. this isn’t the first time.
"we were here on a sunday and none of us spoke any dutch (which we made very clear to the extremely rude waiter). we ordered two plates of the pasta gambas. we found out after eating (because i managed to google translate that the dish shouldve included mussels which it didnt), that this day apparently was the restaurants leftovers of the week-day - they served us the leftovers from that week and the waiter didnt tell us earlier. when i complained, he said, the leftover-day was announced on the first page of the menu. we made it very clear to him none of us spoke dutch from the beginning, but he never cared to enclose this information. however, i did check the menus first two pages on google translator again and did not find any information on the leftover-day. when i kept complaining he told me to stop giving him this attitude (actually quoting him here). we ended up paying 15€ for each of those pasta gamba leftover dishes no one told us about. i am not enclosing the waiters name here in public but if the restaurant is interested, i most definitely can. do not come here, especially when youre a tourist."

"nice place to grab some sunshine, nice ambience, even seating inside, customer service is ok and food average. some options are good, others not so good (avoid the burger! unless you like junk food)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of children’s toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"the food at il caffe is simple but very tasty, with enough options for vegetarians. staff sometimes a bit slow (i had dinner here a few times and there was almost always a wrong order) but friendly nontheless. the restaurant has an easy going vibe and is not expensive at all, which makes it a favourite haunt for many students."
"it is a student café with all that it involves: the café classics (average burger, salad and saté) for a good price, a pool table and some comfy sofas to have a drink on. still, the atmosphere is quite relaxed and the staff very friend. recommended if youre around."
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbq’ed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
the frites were made as i watched however there was a separate charge for mayo or ketchup which is unusual.  the shrimp kroken was also locally made.  there was a bit of confusion that the pin wasnt available and cash was required.
"as its our last night here we wanted a special meal, we made a bad choice, as i have left in tears unable to eat my food and having been spoken too so rudely....the menu leads you to believe you get chips and salad with all main meals....as they brought out one portion between 4 of us i felt it was ok to go and ask where the others were to be informed that was it but we could order others and being told to let her finish when i politely pointed out that it doesnt say that on the menu.... i have left my husband there with the children as i was so disgusted....what a horrid way to end such a lovely holiday....added to this my husband just paid 109 euros for a meal that only 2 of the 4 ate......by the way other staff were lovely but the rudeness of one ruined it."
"after the kids playground we took the break for small lunch. it is nice place - view to the harbor. as outside it was hot, we decided to eat inside. it took some time to find from the something to everybody. menu did not impress. service was also not enthusiastic (but also not bad). next time rather for drinks then food."
service makes a restaurant experience and this experience was awful. awful!!! almost two hours of waiting for an incomplete order of burger and fries and waiters that just don’t car 
"its good location, nice view. we went there for lunch. smoked salmon with bread was delicious. they also served iced cold beer :)"
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"de klink 2.0, it is much better than we visited last time when it was still just de klink. service was a bit slow, we went for lunch on sunday and there were two staffs. anyway, food was great. we really like chicken saté and schnizel. "
we were there for snacks and drink. it was pretty busy as it was on sunday. tables on terraces were in a good location. the service was slow because there was only one staff who could take orders. the other staffs were not so helpful. we asked the differences of the menus but he could not answer and was not willing to find the answer for us. only he asked us to ask other staff. the location is good if you want to chill and if you are okay with slow service.
we had booked a table on line but on line bookings are not looked at. bookings were hand-written on a small piece of pap 
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."

"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. “no problem, sir. your round table is reserved”, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: “ we never book fixed tables sir, sorry”. but….. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"
"ice cream and food are not special, and service it is just terrible. went for an ice-cream with my little one and husband and we wanted to stay longer to have a coffee and something to eat, so i requested a table but the waiter saw us with an ice-cream and told us no, and he pointed out outside saying that the sits for people who buy ice-cream are outside not inside the restaurant. we just wanted a table to have lunch! should not matter if we also bought ice-cream earlier.... anyway, not the first time i experience bad service there and not the first time i hear from friends about the bad service. for sure i am not going back anymore, they just lost a client.."
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
"proper “twents” hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs it’s a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70’s feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still don’t understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "
"perfect place voor eating in town at affordable prices after you have done your shopping. in summer outside on its terrace . meal quality is good on average, but do not expect high cuisine. very friendly staff."
"the most slowly serving in my life. felt like i turned one more year. we ordered 8 small bitterballen and waited 45+ minutes. stuff served everyone in restaurant except us. i literally saw 15+ burgers (would be enough for a whole caw), desserts, drinks and also meat balls. i’m sure they just forgot about us and didn’t even say sorry. i just canceled our order and said i’m not gonna pay for the food i can’t eat. some girl next to us asked if we want her french fry  "
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
"from the outside, the villa ruimzicht looks really impressive. but the rooms cannot meet the expectations. the room weve had was covered with dust. so was the entire hallway. another point of criticism was the service in the restaurant. they were quite disorganized, and in my opinion, the food is slightly overpriced."
"we had meals on two occasions here, once on the terrace (burger/fries - c.19euros) and then in the restaurant. burger was nice but i think a little overpriced. our restaurant meal would have been very nice had my lobster (24euros) been served hot. it was only warm so i had to send it back. friendly staff. "
whilst the food we had was ok it was not the best value for money. what i found very annoying was we ordered drinks and asked for tap water as well (it was 36 degrees and we had been cycling all day). i cancelled my drinks order in order to be able to have water! other restaurants happy to give a jug of water in this situation.
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"some teenagers wanted to take-out fries on a sunny sunday, but were told that no takeaway allowed on busy days. they had to order while sitting on the terrace, but no ordinary fries available on the menu. they were forced to choose the fries with a small spare rib, priced at eur  "
the food are very nice but it took 1.5 hour for pur food to come. we have to ask for 3 times and the last one i have to say if the food still not come then we will leave immediatel 
"we chose this restaurant to host a catch up with a group of friends. it was a great location as the restaurant terrace is right on the edge of the beach and there is a playground just in front of it which was ideal for all of the kids. we booked a table from 11-5pm, with the plan that our friends would come and go at various times during the day and we would order food as required. when we first arrived, the staff were friendly enough and checked that we were happy with the table they had arranged. our initial orders were fine, but as the afternoon progressed, the service got slower and slower. this was despite the fact that it wasnt all that busy. we had one vegetarian with us, so we asked for a dish to have the meat removed from it, however when it arrived, the meat was included. on top of that we ordered a couple of things that never came yet they still ended up on the bill. we had one couple arrive at around 2pm and when we went to order extra food we were told that the kitchen was closed. when we pointed out that we had specifically booked the table with the understanding that we would order food throughout the afternoon, the staff advised that they could prepare a limited set of items from the menu. the food eventually came and the bill was amended, but we would have enjoyed our afternoon a lot more without the irritation of the poor service."
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di 
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
i doesnt happen a lot that kids dont like the ice-cream. in this case 4 kids disliked it. too bad. it was warm and sunny.
today our friends booked a table in this restaurant. we had a set menu with five dish 
we had two days a dinner; not outstanding. but very friendly and helpful staff. one could dine à la carte and also make use of a bbq-buffet.
took a break in this beach restaurant whilst walking on the beac 
"we attended a family diner for 15 people and we were seated in a corner, at 1 table. for this pre-ordered diner, they served several starters and main courses. dessert was served on plate. it was really a pity that the plates were so large from size, that there was hardly any space on the table. the service was friendly and checked upon us regularly."
"the food was ok but no more than that. we ordered calamaris and parmazan  fries and the calamares were small and overcooked, the fries were good."
dogs are allowed on the beach from october. after a long beach walk we treated ourselves on a delicious apres-walking drink in the beach restaurant kaap-duin. the interior is reminiscent of a xenos store. but who cares
"the food was nice, we had a shared salmon plate. though they forgot one part of the order but still put it on the bill.  personnel refused to speak english and explain couple of things on the menu.  long wait on not a busy day."
"forget the local wifi connection. they wont tell you the password unless its summer season... which wasnt, you guessed right! for entrance bitterballen - rather empty of content but crispy - acceptable. not acceptable was the fact that nobody provided us with cutlery nor napkins... we had to pick it up ourselves. the rest of the dishes was ok ish, both involved chicken thigh "
we stopped late afternoon for a cup of coffee. unfortunately a very loud woman disturbed us and the other customers.
the staff was very kind. wine was very nice. food didn’t seem to be homemade. tomato soup was very sweet.  we will give it another try though.
"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
"lunch was good, just 2 kroketten with cryspy bread which was good. the cola (it was pepsi, so thats bad enough already) had no sparkly taste, awfull to drink it that way! its a tourist place so people will stop by anyway."
this bar/restaurant has a great spot on the canal but everything else was average.  i wouldnt eat there again.
waiter cashed and cleaned neighboring tables without saying a word or even recognizing me - after 15 minutes i le 
"the location of this place is really nice, right on the water. we only had drinks and snacks and they were fine. but the service was made me give only 3 stars. one girl was okay but the other girl had no idea what she was doing. "
"when you are seated next to the kitchen and the owner/manager is constantly yelling at the staff, when you have to wait 45 minutes between starter and main course, the food better be outstanding. and when it is only good enough the experience is utterly disappointing"
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often there’s more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guest’s conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."

"i had lunch at tante koosje, 11 december 2021. yes quite a while ago, so why i am writing a review now ? because they are so proud of their micheline star, but not acting like it. i had lunch there the food was nice but not unique i have eaten at better one star restaurants. the service was not michelin worthy, it was far away from that. so i wrote a constructive email on 11.12.2021 about it, expecting a reply, which i did not get. then i wrote an email again on 11.01.2022, with a little reminder that a reply would be appreciated, guess what, i did not get a reply. so now after a couple of month i feel lets leave a review. as mentioned already the food is nice, but the price you pay is not only for the food, but also for the service and the service sucked in many ways and does not come near to a michelin star restaurant. there are better one star michelin restaurants where you could go in the netherlands. so my advise safe yourself a trip."
"we had a cosy board meeting over a 4 course dinner (the april menu) yesterday evening, 7 gues "
"a very charming location. we were sitting outside but it took too long before we were taken to the table. tasting menu, some fish, some pigeon, ice cream i remember. probably too much messing around with the food..too complicated...without great result. certainly not bad though. wine pairing nice but too much explaining from the brochure without really knowing. water pouring with constant dripping, serving a bit too much from the hip. approx 100 euro per person. "
"dining at tante koosje is always, no fail!, a treat. no exception this time. however, there is bound to be a however. my friends and i also in treated ourselves to the accompanying wine menu. this we should not have done. it was an interesting selection but served with aplomb and supposed knowledge that did not reflect in the taste of the wine. hence the average this ti "
"we were greeted, seated and then just sat there waiting for someone to come to the table to offer us a drink or any form of service. eventually we had to ask for a drink, which came. when my wife and i had both finished our drinks we sat there for a good while before we again had to ask to be served. we had been there for around 30 minutes before the menus came. the lady that served the wine felt it appropriate to just pour the wine and start telling us about it, interrupting our conversation and talking over us. it felt as though you were an imposition to some of the staff by being there and each of us at the table felt the same way. i have had better service at burger king than displayed by some of the staff, the food is not as good but then you dont have to pay 350 euros for it. for a michelin starred restaurant i expect much better, and for the price there are much better restaurants out there."
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91€ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."
"i held my wedding luncheon here with just a handful of guests in 2015. although it was just a small luncheon, my husband and i arrangd this as our only formal celebration. i had arranged some music to be played which the owner agreed to in advance. however, when the time of the event arrived, there was one other table seated at the time with two guests where the owner saw fit to give full his attention and cater to their opinions above ours. i had a wedding with music i couldnt hear and the owner remained preoccupied with sitting by these two other guests the entire time instead of being pleased that two people from other parts of the world chose his restaurant to celebrate their special day. when i asked to be able to hear the music, he chided that i must be considerate of other guests. i was not immediately angry and paid the bill in full but when i later attempted to connect on social media to possibly discuss my issue, i was ignored. a wedding is a once in a lifetime event and so caterers have a responsibility to uphold whereas his attitude is completely unacceptabl "
"a good host knows when you want his attention and when you want him to stay in the background. the host in this restaurant does not. dining here meant we had to pay attention to unnecessary explanations, including some ridiculous wine-for-dummies talk, while we were here for a family gathering, spending some precious time together. the food actually wasnt bad."
"had a very nice dinner with friend from hendrik-ido-ambacht. our reservations didnt work. we ended up having to wait 15 min. to be seated. the service was good once we did get seated. the food was middle of the road. i had beef steak. the poor old milk cow that gave her life ended up on my plate, good taste but very tuff and chewy. my wife have vegetarian plate that her just love. our friend had rabbit that look good too. "
food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.
"lovely place, great view. need some improvement on the fo "
"the service has been very slow! seems like this place is understaffed, especially in the kitchen. it took the waitressing staff ages taking our order and then bringing the food. my cousins bitterballen were more empty than full and it took an age for her dessert to arrive. it did appear like theyve forgotten to bring it, despite having ordered soon after ordering the tea and cof "
"for lunch its extremely busy, which is good. my omelette was excellent but my wifes tomato soup was from the ah can or alike, which is not what you expect. service is good and fast. prices are very reasonable"
"as well as the service is ok, the menu is very basic and the cooking is medium. there is an opportunity to enjoy a buffet restaurant, the time-frame is rather too short if you are not advised to get in as they start the time-fra "
"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"

"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "
"we recently had a wine tasting in that restaurant followed by a 4-course-dinner (group of in total 4 people). the dinner was served at the first floor of the building (so not in the restaurant). we do not know if they had to bring the food from downstairs where the kitchen is located, but it took a while before food was served. the service was not good and could be better. they did not pay enough attention to the guests, probably as there were too many people and only few waiters. very often they forgot to tell us what is served on our plates. the food was good, but not special. the price for that dinner was fixed and reasonable for what we got (as we booked for wine tasting and dinner together), so we did not see the separate menues and do not know what it costs to eat a-la-carte. not sure, if we would come back to this restaurant."
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."

"n52°5717.3 e7°818.6 part of the camping site “de bronzen eik”, the restaurant looks authentic inside. you can drink and eat in the café or in the more quiet side rooms. the german weißen beer is available from the beer tap. we enjoyed it very much in april 2012. the restaurant food was a completely different story. the waitresses, who serve you drinks, disappear in the kitchen behind the bar, to prepare your food because there is no chef working in the kitchen. to make the combination of serving drinks and cooking feasible, the part-time cooking is done with microwave and fryer. between serving customers behind the bar, frozen food from the freezer is put in the microwave or fryer. unaware of this practise, we ordered local stew pot and fried sole. the local stew pot was canned food from the wholesale. the fried sole lived to long in the freezer. nothing fresh, nothing tasteful. just examples of inferior pub food. very disappointing. only the drinks were worthwhile visiting this café/restaurant."
we have to wait for a few hours in heerenberg so we took this cozy place for a coffee and cake. good place to sit back and relax.
"in a quiet town, main street, this restaurant/bar is situated. you can have a good drink and a (menu based) meal downstairs. and up stairs they have a all you can eat tapas concept. the place is modern and nicely decoreted (fairly new on the inside). they have a nice glass fence-like area where you can look down into the café. they have a bar upstairs but the food comes from the kitchen downstairs. the food is good, portion size quite decent and it tastes well. it is above average compared to other concepts. staff serving was fairly young and unexperienced but they did their best."
dark restaurant. bad light.  we had lunch but it wasnt that much.. the staff looks like they wanted to get you leave asap.
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"so you have done a reservation with this restaurant, but arriving at the place results in a closed door. not even a reaction to the reservator. restaurant is not closed or whatsoever.   advise: dont go there."
"we arrived, tired and hungry, an hour before they closed for the day at 5pm and ordered from the menu we were given - we hadnt had lunch. the waitress returned a few minutes later to say the kitchen had already closed and couldnt produce the burgers wed ordered. (why didnt she know that before?) she suggested ordering again and shed see what they could do, but it soon became obvious that everything was off except chips and chicken nuggets, not even a sandwich could be provided. so we ate chicken nuggets (a first for both of us) and watched those around us having similar conversations with the waitress and being served chips to go with their beers. a shame, because the outdoor tables are a lovely place to sit in the afternoon sun with a view of the fort."
"nice location, easy to reach from the highway a27, enough free parking plac "
"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 €. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.

"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but i’m a little disappointed by the service."
the local soup (limburgse mosterd soup) was delicious. the french fries very good. the rest of the meal (meat and fish) good but not memorable.
"friendly staff, food was good perhaps slightly expensive for what they offered.  interior a bit dated."

you have to walk a bit to reach the brewery. the service and food were good. they have many different types of beers.
"we come from the northeastern us and this feels like a very northeasternly kind of place - from the atmosphere to the pricy pub menu and craft beer selection. the menu is more limited if going after 5 p.m. (as of this writing), with options for burgers, fish and chips, and similar entrees. the beet soup was delicious, as was the fish and chips. beer-lovers will find a number to choose from, with an option for flights. it’s a really beautiful walk from the train (look for the windmills by the bridge); go when the weather is nice."

"we just got ripped off 4 euros from this establishment. we ordered a mix of raw beef and cheese for 9.5 euros. then at the bill it is 13.5 euros, billing 2 individual dishes. we told her we ordered the mix and she said it is not on the menu anymore, except she gave me the menu i ordered while spelling and pointing at the mix, and she never said it was not available. avoid this place, they are not honest!"
"the restaurant is now called “trattoria italiana diga”. my review? terrible service and terrible food! we sat at the terrace as the weather was quite good (for april). the waitress came quite quickly to take our order (spaghetti with mussels and gambas, spaghetti with tomato sauce (kid portion) and a pizza tonno). the two orders of spaghetti arrive. first comment: i asked mine to be served with spicy sauce. never ate such a blend spaghetti even after adding more salt and pepper. impossible to eat it. my husband’s pizza was nowhere to be seen even after 10 min of our orders being served. we waited and waited, until i decided to call again the waitress (another one came). we asked for the pizza, spicy olive oil and parmesan. we had to wait another 10 min until the pizza arrived (letting us guess that the order had never been placed). the spicy olive oil? i had to ask for it again (btw: my pasta was served with just half a dozen gambas, the mussels were missing in combat!). the parmesan? never came. the pizza was as blend as my spaghetti and the lack of “spicy” in the spicy olive oil didn’t help in my already stretched patienc "
"went there for diinner because we saw the menu posted outside and it looked great. a waiter greeted us and told us to have a seat anywhere and he would find us. we seated ourselves and never saw the waiter again. after about ten minutes of waiting to be served and our dirty table cleaned, we finally had to flag down a waiter to order. we placed our order and the food was deliverd by another waiter. we ate our complete meal without anyone asking how our meal was or do we need anything else. i looked for a waiter to get our check and finally we got the attention of a person and they told us to go inside to pay. and by the way, we asked for a couple of glasses of tap water and was told that was not available, only by the bottle for sale. yes, they got us.. i eneded up buying one without asking the price...5 euros. we are here in town for 4 more nights and we wont return."
"very nice place, but after 1h i’m still sitting here and no one has served us anything. asked once to the blond waitress working on saturdays and i have to say i’m amazed by how rude she was. about the food i have no clue, i’ll let you now if they bring it."
really bad service. we’ve waited for 45min and nothing was served. i’ll never come back and seriously won’t recommend.
the service was slow. not enough staff on the floor. asked which cheeses were on the plate. waiter didntt know. had as main course pasta 4 formagi. no flavour on it and when i said that to the waiter. i got extra gratin cheese to give it a little bit of flavour. the interieur is out dated. they have a wonderfull place. hopefully they make something out of this. by
"this little eatery is a short walk on the other side of the bridge from zaanse schanse windmills. we decided to stop because of the bubble waffles on the menu posted by the doors. boy, were we disappointed. the bubble waffle was not freshly made. we saw the cook take the pre-made bubble waffle out of the refrigerator and reheat it in the oven. bubble waffle, two lattes, and still water totaled €22.90. not a good value for pre-made bubble waffle. cash only, does not accept american express. the only positives are clean bathrooms and free wifi."

"food is ok especially sea food always fresh but not very imaginative menu. in itself not a bad thing but the prices are a bit too high for the quality of the menu. service is very variable and not consistent, friendly but not very professional especially in summer time. definitely a case of not to much competition around. been there several times in 3 periods in 2016. summer and winter"
"we got our starter, my bread was ice cold and so hard i nearly broke my teeth on it! then we waited 45 mins till we got our main meal! did they forget us? then when it did come my partners mussels/clams were mostly all still closed and further down the pan even cold! my meat was luke warm and the sauce cold. but the chips were hot! the lovely girl serving did take some drink off our bill, she was nice and helpful, but saying that..... we would not ever go back to this restaurant."

"the place has style, the sea is a few meters away, you have outdoor tables but unfortunately the service it’s bad. i asked for a caesar salad with chicken. i started to eat and noticed that there were also slices of fish or sardines.i cant eat any seafood, i immediately stopped eating and my appetite was gone, the waitress approached her, i explained the situation very kindly and she really didnt care, she didnt take the plate away, she didnt apologize, she didnt ask me if i was allergic or treated to solve the problem, he only said ok maybe it’s problem with the kitchen and left, then i ordered two cocktails with the same waitress and when the runner arrived with the drinks he gave me a bottle of beer in which i indicated it was not correct. when i requested the bill the they never removed a bottle of beer and the salad from the bill, so check your bill well before paying for they only say the total amount that was supposedly consumed. i asked the waitress to remove the drink and plate of food from the bill. dont even tou "
"amazing location,and very busy on a good day,but overpriced with rude service,no customer satisfaction at all, if they cant handle how busy it gets then serve less,the food was blunt,burger overcooked, as long as customers do not say nothing they will not change anything, i will not be returning and i wonder why people cue up to get in this place !! i have to say drinks where okay though!! "
"the weather was great, but still it was a rather unpleasant experience at aloha. perhaps it was a bad apple, but the service from one of the waiters was painful. grumpy, uncooperative and on the verge of what you could call rude. pay attention to the bill, as it could be different from what the menu says (not in your favor). burgers are meh, meat cooked well but the bun was pretty dry. will definitely not be coming back here!"
"after my sister-in-law and mother-in-law had brought me to this beach cafe, i had wanted to bring my partner, and some of our friend "
"for the first time this year we went to the beach. and aloha is always te best spot in velsen noord / wijk aan zee. for warm drinks and wine its the perfect spot. for lunch, i think the chef had an off-day, especially with the vegetarian dishes. hope the next time, the food will be better. plus side: the staff and just love this hang-out for the summer. "
"great location, cute beachy interior but horrible service, i realize its a beach bar but we ordered a burger which when served was rare, asked politely if we could have it cooked a bit more, and were told thats how the burgers are served like it or no "
bio burger used to be the best burger you could get in wijk aan zee. now they dont serve them with wedges anymore and hard bread.
"we like the place but seriously, 1h15 to get 3 burgers and a salad, ordered at 6pm?  not ideal if like us you have children. staff was very friendly though and offered us drinks."
"all we had was coffee and tea, the staff is very friendly but has a lack of awareness about whats going on outside on the terrace."
"we went here on a saturday to try out their weekly all you can eat chicken deal. for 12,50 euro a person you get a large pan with chicken on your table which contains wings and legs. along with that you get an asian chicken dish. also some chicken satay, a small bowl with fries, mayonaise and you may use the simple salad bar. any of these items you can have restocked as often as you want without extra charge. so not expensive. the taste of the food is pretty dull though. it also takes quite some time before the chicken is served, so think ahead of time if you want to have extra of somethi "
we had dinner in the fletcher restaurant. the waiters advized us to take the deer. the food tasted good but we wondered if it really was deer. it tasted more like a regular sirloin of a cow. nevertheless it was an enjoyable evening
this hotel is situated in a rural part of overijssel. nice and quiet... enough parking posibillities. it has a nice swimmingpool and staff is quite friendly indeed. rooms are spacious but could do with a makeover. furniture and styling are a little outdated...but everything looks clean. wifi is strong through out the hot 
"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
didnt get offered the menu that others seemed to have (eggs bacon). waited half hour for luke warm soup . nice enough staff. but very dated menu
"after a ceremony at the nearby war cemetery our party of eleven descended on the schoonoord. fortunately i had made a reservation as our visit coincided with the annual remembrance celebrations for the battle of arnhem, & the schoonoord seems to be a popular haunt for participants & visitors in this respect. consequently the place was extremely busy & the staff stretched in dealing with the substantial number of guests. service was slow & a bit random, & it took a long time to get the bill. as for the food, it was affordable “pub” food, nothing to rewrite home about. the wok dish seemed to be appreciated by those of our party who had it, but the deconstructed ribs were so-so. verdict; overall, pretty unremarkable. "
stopped here for lunch during a battlefield tou 
"after waiting for 20 minutes, and no one of the waiters showing up, we left for another place to have lunch."
"firstly, the food when it actually arrived was quite good, but having waited 30 minutes for a drink, then a further 50 mins (80 in total) for a cheese banquette, im less than impressed. the waitresses were friendly and polite, but this is the third time ive eaten here and my experience is always the same "
we stopped in the grand cafe for a late lunch.  the food was average but the service was very slow.  would not stop here again.
went to the grand cafe as part of a group tour. the owners had been pre notified we were coming and how many we ar 
we ate here on a saturday morning. we had to wait for a very long time before our order was taken (we had to ask for the order to been taken several times) and for an even longer time before we were served. and unfortunatly the food was not worth the wait. the portions are hughe but the food was very grea 
"early evening snack meal. ease of parking. service average, however, food of good standard. met our expectations for a casual meal."
"the food was plentiful but ordinary. we are of dutch descent and i speak dutch quite well and had no problem making myself understood. the female server was aware we are canadian and she spoke good english so we had no problem understanding each other. she took care of the drinks. a young male server gave us a menu. we spoke in dutch. he left and went behind the counter and laughed and make fun of us. when he returned with our meal and later asked us if everything was to our liking he deliberately spoke dutch as fast as possible which was difficult to understand. we replied by saying pardon in english and he then spoke in english, slowly. im giving an average rating for service - the young woman was fine but the service rating for the young man is poor. that young man needs an attitude adjustment! if you cannot be respectful towards tourists who are doing their best with your language then you should not be working in the service industry."
was part of a tour group of 30 that had pre-booked lunch last sunday. we arrived 20 mins late due to road closures for arnhem commemoration to find no table available and worse no food - despite the fact that we had pre-ordered baguettes the day before! appalling service and no apology from staff member who couldnt care less and shrugged her shoulders! so much for dutch hospitality. avoid this place. 
+food was tasty ant first and well presente 
"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this “brasserie” is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."
"we attended this restaurant on two occasions .the first (for a lunch) , we had a good experience. sadly the second experience wasnt so good ! we called in for an evening meal and ordered our choice > the restaurant was quite busy and we noted the owner/manager was sat near the front door observing . in fact he had been sat in that position and seat we we had been there befor "
"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"the restaurant is located within a short walk from the airborne museum, and we had lunch here after our museum vis "
the best thing about this restaurant is that it is just next door to the airborne museum. it is in the midst of a parking lot and hence very well positioned. we went there in lunch time and placed an order but our order was forgotten by the service staff. since we were getting delayed we had to be satisfied with a cup of coffee. the restaurant was elegant and staff were courteous but we were out of luck! we had to rush to giethoorn and hence left.
"this restaurant is located in a building next to the villa with the same name, housing the airborne museum. flowers everywhere told the story of the new management, since january 1st. service was a bit chaotic and the seating somewhat cramped, but the lunch menu offered a selection of simple but tasty food. i selected the bread with smoked salmon and a draft swinckels beer. the beer was cold and the salmon plate was prepared with due care. the test of careful preparation lies in the state of the capers on the smoked salmon. here the chef had rinsed and dried the capers, removing the awful brine taste. a good score for the food. but when i add the service, seating and price level i arrive at a three point rating."
"we’ve visited the restaurant and enjoyed our 3 course dishes. when we compare the quality / price, the price is to high for the quality of the food. food was good."
i was very hungry after leaving the museum and convenience was high on my priority list. the selection here is pretty limited. i had croquettes and lobster soup. inexplicably the lobster soup had shrimp in it but the broth did taste of lobster. the 2 croquettes were huge. it was all fine but not outstanding and not really cheap. it served my purpose but i would look elsewhere if i had some time. 
been there for lunch with whole family. for kids not interesting menu and for adults the salads are different and worthy to try. the rest is normal dutch boring lunch food. nice place though and super good service. an average to good mark.
"been here twice, forgot the first time -- that is typical for the place "
"like the title says, cosy and nice but the food was a bit disappointing. did not reply to what the titles suggested. was ok but not challenging."
this place has a nice outdoor seating and it is nicely maintained. drinks and snacks arw quite good though a bit expensive. but is doea have a nice view and a history.
"nicely located, decent dinner menu, lunch somewhat limited. beautiful old villa with friendly girls waiting your table. when we had our lunch the restaurant wasnt full, yet it took a very long time before the food came ou "
"i made a reservation in the middle of the week, close to the big airborne event. the interior van be defined as tastefully selected variety of colors and forms,shapes but not my choice. it appears to me as cold and distant. and i experience that in the presence of staff as wel "
during our recent visit to airborne museum me and my wife decided to have diner at this place. unfortunately after 50 min of waiting for a steak (medium rear) and home made burger we were served with something that looked like a steak but tasted like grilled rubber. i suspect they grilled frozen chunk of meat and warmed it in a microwave. i refused to eat it. we shared my wife home made burger. i do not want to advertise mac donalds but for its taste and look and price they are much better not mention the price.to our surprise when it came to pay the bill they tried to charge for that rubber that is listed in they menu as beef fillet. keep away!
"our annual trip to oosterbeek with a market garden veteran was earlier this year than our usual september visit. we always visit the hartenstein@laurie a couple of times and always look forward to it. this year i needed gluten free and the staff seemed to struggle a little with it. after initially saying they could adapt anything on the menu, it became apparent that they couldnt and i ended up with a (small) plate of vegetables with some melted chee "
"visited this restaurant with a friend of mine. we got seated in a quite busy restaurant and ordered something to drink while waiting for menus written in english. the menus and drinks arrived swiftly, and once decided what to order we put down the menus on the table. during the next 20 minutes we watched our waiter seating and taking food/drink orders from at least three tables (all of which had arrived later than us). the waiter simply ignored us - we even watched him small talking with other guests while we were waiti "
"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at €19 each! we couldn’t finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to €46! i can’t help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. there’s many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
the restaurant looks cosy but sitting downstairs in the aterlier is different. good portion for lunch and it is delicious. service is a bit slow.
"bakery schuld originates from de town oldebroek, (producing the local cake klinkertjes) but has also a branch in elburg, comprising of a historic windmill in working order and associated buildings, where a bakery, a bakery shop and a cafe are situated. a target for a very interesting visit. ample free parking is offered around the complex. we visited to buy several packages of klinkertjes, but when we were paying at the cashiers counter, a member of the staff, probably not in the customer-comes-first mode, put a heavy box on some of our purchases. we had to get fresh packages from the shop to replace the flattened cakes. room for improvement in the customer service department."
we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef i’ve had in the years i’ve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit “quasi-rural” venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the €25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. i’ll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i don’t ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldn’t make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesn’t agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i don’t wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."
this restaurant has wonderful ambience; shabby chic decor with wonderful holiday decor. definitely unique in the netherlan 
"its a great location and looks really trendy, but there was such poor service. the waitress walked passed us 7 times ignoring us when we wanted to order food. had to get the attention of another waitress instea "
good food and a very nice looking bistr 
"had dinner here with my girlfriend. the bistro is small and friendly, but we did not really enjoy the food very much. it was ok, but not what we had expected. the service was good and friendly though. dont think i will be back here again. "
"service in this restaurant is extremely bad, after 20 mins no one came to take our order. surprisingly they have 4 waitresses with such service. finally one came after we waved for her. my husband ordered melted goat cheese, that must be a piece of bad cheese. it tasted moldy. i will never go there again !!"
"its been a year since my last visit, but i still dont know what to think of this restaurant. it offers a nice sit-down in the outdoor seating area at the main pedestrianised street of the fortified historic center of elburg, where you can watch the passing tourists and they offer nice coffee and cake for the expected elevated dutch prices, but the hospitality still needs a brush-up as i mentioned in my last review, to prevent the restaurant to descend into the category tourist trap. an example: we were with three and due to the position of chairs and tables against the restaurant front, and space only for two at a table, i occupied a separate table. these tables were very close to each other, mind. when i finished my coffee and cake, the waitress cleared my table immediately and inquired, if i desired another drink or the bill. this while my family at the next table hadnt finished there cake yet. talking about throughput in a restaurant. by the way, only half of the tables where occupied. no, i didnt feel welcome and a three point rating, mostly given because the nice spot in elburg, is the best i can do."
"not good, also not very bad. just nothing really stands out here and that’s too bad as the place seems to have all to make it good cosy and upscale place."
what a shame! good food wasted by terrible service. we had booked a table for 6.30 and arrived to be told that the table was not available yet and to go and sit at the bar (no complimentary drink) at 6.50 we were offered a table in their party room which was totally unatmospheric. at 7-15 we were offered an acceptable table. we received no apologies at all. the food was in fact really good but what a shame about the standard of service!!!
the go 
"the terrace is nice, but service absolutely not good: questions about menu were unanswered, made us feel unimportant , food was not as to be expected in relation to price ( dinner) , side dishes seemed very leftover and warmed up. spinach was potatoepuree with few leaves of spinach?, i would not recommend this restaurant ."
"we ordered salmon with fries, it came without fries, the fries arrived when my daughter had finished. my son ordered tenderloin stake, they forgot to bring it, the order arrived when everyone else had finished and it was a plate of little pieces of meat, on top of a lot of salad. i ordered a grilled goat cheese salad, what arrived is regular goat cheese on top of salad, without salad dressing and they said they had no vinegar. my father’s shrimp salad and carpaccio were the only correct dishes. they kept on sending new waiters, who did not know how to react. beautiful town, surely there must be better restaurants around here."
"mediocre food, sloppy service and the ambiance of a buffet-restaurant in a railway station. to be avoided."
"reading previous reviews is unfortunate.  we only came for drinks and snacks and were welcomed and received very nicely. good hospitality,nice beer and good service. cant say otherwise.  try for yourself and make your own judgement."
"went here without a reservation around 20:30 on a saturday evening. we asked for a table for dinner, but inside was fully packed. we were seated outside. the waiter came 1 min. later to tell us there was a table available. this table was a big one for 8/10 pax, but next to the toilets. a big downside were the aggressive flies around our food and drink "
"stopped here for coffee and cake as views were the best in town.  service was a bit lacking, otherwise a decent vist"
"awful experience: 15 minutes before receiving the menu, 1 hour before receiving the first ordered dish, 1 hour and half before receiving the second dish. all of the other customer have been served except us. we have asked for an explaination but the excuse was the kitchen is very busy, despite all the customer were serv "
"the restaurant is located just outside the city centre with a nice view from the terrace over the harbour. the restaurant is dark and the food is ok, but not special."
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
"perfect if you are into toddlers and like quirky austrian dresses on dutch waitresses. loud, unorganized and near average food. good beers. people changing diapers on the next table. parents running after their offspring. dont get me wrong, its crowded on a sunny day. has a playground. mass cant be wrong. just not for me. "
"dinner here with colleagues. solid food, excellent dessert, good, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. difficulty using credit card to pay."
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"nice location, but a nothing special type of ambiance and service. food is cheap and ok, but again nothing special. really a shame because this location on the dobbe plas could be a lot better and special"
we went there with some friends in ju 
"service initially slow. my meal: mosterdsoep | zalm | stokbrood excellent. kalfsentrecote* | italiaanse klassieker | seranoham | seizoensgroenten | salieboter very poor due to high fat and gristle content. dessert average. did not receive an after dinnner despite this being ordered! another member of our group received her main course incorrectly, she was compensated by receiving a plates of french fries. in all honestly this is he first time ive experienced problems at this restaurant. it will be a long time before revisiting."
"i celebrated my birthday here with my family on a lovely summers evening on the outside terras. we all enjoyed our meal and the service was good. we also had the retiral reception for one of our employes in a recently available reception area and this was as we are used to from eetcafe 1837, friendly and attentive staff and tasty well prepared finger food. this is an all round establishment and i would recomend it for family occasions"
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulée, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "
"very nice eatery with outdoor area, friendly and fast staff. portions rather small (both the appetizers and the main dishes) and for that rather expensive (11€ and 17€). the ribs were great, the loempias so-so."
limited menu.  pancakes were the specialty and these were done well.  other items were average.  menu is not in english.
the lunchroom of the huisje van de zeeuw is run by the krimpenerwaard day spending foundation. it provides extra structure to the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by offering daytime activities. this is in line with the perception and ambitions of each individual participant. we enjoyed a good lunch.

"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little café. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"pleasant night in this hotel. comfortable beds, rooms clean. we appreciate the family room with 2 separated rooms (1 for parents and 1 for children). bathroom clean as well but a little bit old. very good breakfast !!!"

we had dinner for four with my sister and partner while staying in the hotel. the food was good and reasonable value. the service was slow and a little dysfunctional. my sisters wineglass was stuck to the table to the extent that the waiter had to prise it off using a knife. the waiter managed to spill some juice from the serving platter on to my sister. the sparkling wine i tried to order had not been chilled. need to improve management.
shame about the two single bed that split avery time you even looked at each ot 
"the food here is a great disappointment. the starter was good enough but the mains were poor. i had dover sole, about 3mm thick and it came with a type of tartar sauce like that which you would get out of a take away packet sauce. my partners chicken satay was very average. not what you expect for €19.50 and €17.5 "

"went for a sunday afternoon drink in this place. we had a good hour out, i would recommend the chicken bites they taste very good. staff is very friendly and takes good time. the coffee is good. it is not too busy. due to the nice weather we sat outdoor."
"atmosphere ok, food average (minimal for the price). we tried it and will not go again as others are way better price wise."
"we came in around 5:30 p.m., because we were going to the theater after dinner. several people already were sitting at the bar. the extremely correct hostess took us to our table. on bringing our drinks, the hostess noticed our theatre booking and reported right away that the food serving would be no problem. extremely attentiv "
we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"
"staying in the (slightly isolated) hotel this was the choice for dinner, and a good option to "
"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant
"recently we visited the restaurant, and there was no table available in a light area. we asked for a table near the window, however most tables were occupied by flexworkers who installed their laptop or backpacks and were nowhere to be seen. the manager, when asked replied that it was no problem to them because they welcome everyon "
"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crème brulée with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"
"warm welcome, splendid interior, long time to wait for the food, two years ago the quality was perfect, it is a pitty, there was not enough personnel"
"on a rainy evening we dropped in in this restaurant. it was almost empty at seven pm. it was chilly in the room and the venue was the same. after adjusting the temperature of the airco to a pleasnat one we enjoyed good food, but a bit distant service. and personally i dont like television screens with football matches on the walls of a restaurant. the terrace outside is rather large but the weather was not inviting to sit down there."
we went to meatpoint because the website looked nice and it was near our home. cocktails are overpriced and service is quite slow and not welcoming.
visited meatpoint thinking it was still manhattan. apparently there was a change in ownership. terrible service. food was not great. gone down hill. avoid if possible.

30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"we had a family lunch at palkinto, really nice place, the food was simple but okay. chill environment."
"had a monday night dinner with a business friend. nice wines, decorum a bit stiff and outdated. we choose the 3 course menu. fish carpaccio with boiled salmon to start and wild hare / stewed beef. then dessert. food was good, but not excellent. i had expected more. "
a pleasant restaurant in an historic house in voorburg.  the park setting is allows you to walk along the tree-lined paths and along the canal.  there are also rooms in this historic mansion.
"i had a bad experience here, bad service and bad food considering the price that you have to pay for th "
"i went with my friend/colleague for a dinner on a friday evening. personnel was very friendly and kept our table even if we were late (but we did call to inform them). we chose the surprise menu, 3 courses. the serving speed was ok, but the portions way too small for that price. we paid a total of €100 euros for: a small bottle of water, 3 glasses of wine, 2 menus and 1 coffee. again, the food itself was good but once home i ate something..."
"first of all let me say that the 3-course meal was excellent, especially the starter with salmon... having said that, the restaurant apparently cannot handle several special deals occuring at the same time. we went here during restaurantweek, but had vouchers for another deal which was different from the one served as part of the restaurant week. we should have been given the choice of 3 dishes for all 3 courses of the meal, but instead we received the same 3-course menu that was part of the restaurant week deal. we mentioned this at the beginning, but were told it was the same. my husband looked up the conditions when we returned home, and not only were we right, they had also overcharged us for the restaurant week special they served us instead. we contacted the restaurant by e-mail about this, but havent received a reply so far. so, what to think... great food, but lousy service?"
"had dinner here with a larger group. the service was good but the menu and food was average, actually disappointing. the reason for the verdict was that the dishes were so bland."
"the restaurant looks good but thats about it. the ingredients were bland and boringly cooked. nothing impressive. pretentiously trying to be gourmet/fancy but the only thing they did was decrease the portions of a regular home-made meal. the service was very weak (they stored our coats in the kitchen because they didnt have space elsewhere, but didnt warn us about it, so it was with much surprise that we left the restaurant with our coats smelling of cooking!). would definitely not go there again."
"the food is great, but the service could be better in a more classy place like this. it is near the railway station of voorburg, so easy to reach."
i have been there a few times with friends and work colleague 
"there is a big area to sit outside, but in the summer it is very crowded and you might not get a place to sit. in the winters there is also enough place inside but it is packed and not really something you want to have dinner. however, for a quick lunch this is a good place since there are not much places like in voorbur "
my friends who have been to voorburg in the summer tell me this is a lovely place to sit out on the terrace in the sun. that might be tru 
located in the heart of historic voorburg this restaurant/bar is a good place to have dinner or just a drink (on the terrace). good service and food. also reasonably priced.
"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p. 
nice restaurant and clean.  good for lunch.  food and drinks reasonable price and service ok.  pasta with prawns and chicken sate are good.
"the interior is looking well taken care of, the service was a bit slow. that was strange because there were enough waitresses walking aroun "
this place needs new management. food and coffee (illy👌) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.

we came back here after a 2 yea 
"we had a great meal, but the service was slow. waited for drinks for more then 15min also a refill was taking very long. then next to us was a very loud table and when asking the waiter about it he just smiled and pulled up his shoulder "
"i was very excited to go this restaurant, after it was recommended by a friend, and booked it for my husbands birthday dinner. the location and setting is great. the restaurant also has a nice vibe to it and was full on a saturday night. unfortunately, it was clearly understaffed and understocked when it comes to fo "
"a great location and nice food, but that is what you expect in this price range. the service is friendly, but lacks professionalism. the menu and wine lists are rather short. we had an enjoyable evening, but i felt trapped in a concept (including fake flowers and an artificial smell)."
"even though the food was still tasteful, the overall experience was very disappointi "
"private parking, nice view in the restaura "
food was okay but not the price you have to pay for it.  wish the former chef stayed...... the service was average.
the friendly hipster staff makes up for the minimalistic non-hipster motif and a few regulars who treat it like their own truck driver pit stop. the quality of their products including their pastry seems out of place considering there is not much competition or a discerning public but their efforts should be rewarded by a visit while passing through or instead of sitting indoors for coffee chats. a few neighborhood fans certainly dont want to see this coffee corner go even if it doesnt exactly fit the neighbourhood picture. i agree. the sleepy town needs some pepping up!
it was a busy friday evening and the two girls working front of house were very busy. the service was therefore very slow but very friendly.  the food was good but they needed more staff.
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasn’t a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anyway… waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"resto is located in the same building and complex as the senior citizens home.  it is rather. interior is spacious and decor is just right. food was fine and done well, although nothing that stands out. service was also fine."
"this is a very nice restaurant in many respects. the interior is very nice and excellent service. i think the chef also really knows how to cook as shown by the good taste of several of the dishes, with special compliments for the french fries. however, some serious problems need to be fixed. an almost complete lack of healthy vegetables is nowadays hardly acceptable anymore. furthermore, all dishes were far too high on calories, e.g. the pumpkin soup, and especially the dessert was completely over the top with too much cookies and other stuffing ingredients. so if they adapt to modern times and give much more attention to healthy ingredients, that by the way most often can also taste great, this restaurant has a great future. "
"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
great for kids but... service was lackin 
it was a nice day so the children could play outside and watch the animals while we chatted with our friends. we were there on sunday at lunchtime and the restaurant was otherwise empty! pancakes were fine but not very special.
"we visited here because we wanted to have lunch, but ordered coffee first. the waitress serving the coffee accidentally put her hand in one of the cups and spilled coffee on the saucer. she left and we thought she would come back with a new cup and to clean up but she didnt. another waitress brought the menus, and despite relatively high prices we wanted to order but then nobody showed up for fifteen minutes to take our order. so we decided to leave. not a good experience."
"this pancake house has a perfect location, enough space to park your car and bike. also, the restaurant has a large fenced-in playground/petting zoo which keeps your children happy. you can sit on the deck and enjoy the sun while the kids run around (but cant get away "
went there with the kids in the summer. the location is nice with parking space for cars and there is a small playground outside which the kids liked a l 
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesn’t seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. we’ll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chef’s cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
food and service were good; the privé of a glass house wine is way to much ..... vertalingen the raason ... not yo come back
"we went there for dinner, the service was very slow, you have to wait a lot just to get the meniu. i ordered something from “chef’s special” duo van kalf...it was so expensive, just so expensive as a tuna stake, but on the plate was almost nothing. the meat was not juicy at all, the beef was just cooked. nobody asked if we liked it, we could say it just in the end. and yes...we paid 21,5. € for it. very disappointed!"
"really disappointed due to overcrowding and stressed almost rude personnel. pity, since the food was good and the ambiance too. nonetheless leaving people to wait for at least an hour is way too much!!!"
we spent an afternoon here while in the area as we love craft beer and knew that de molen had won awards for their beers. the selection available on tap was very good although given how closely it is brewed to the cafe i felt the prices were a little high. it would have been nice if they had a sour (geuze) available too. 
it was a nice afternoon and we had been cycling so wanted to stop and have something to dri 
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be €2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
cosy place but the food was absolutely not worth the money. worst meal i had in years. the beer was good. touristtrap.
i didnt expect these tastes..i didnt like it at all..i dont know what happened..the last time i visited the restaurant was before two years and all the plates was amazing and could pass by my esophagus but unfortunately this time i have only to say the worse with lots of water..
"excellent food, could not fault it for freshness and tast "
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"the staff are really not caring or professional here most of the time. the food is not the best but its ok (average), if the staff had a better attitude and where professional this would not be such a bad place to eat but with bad service and average food. we have tried this place a few times and every time we think why did we do it. its a hit and miss. and we go expecting the hit only to miss most of the time. would not recommend."
"not satisfying at all, staff was not really caring (students having a job, but absent), food was ok but too much and not really 4star level, for a top3 restaurant really not where it should be, will prefer other restaurant next time"
we visited this restaurant last week with 5 people (incl. our 5 year old so 
you’d think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30… but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. won’t be coming back for breakfast that’s for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we enjoyed a great get together here, where the facility was perfect, the coffee was plentiful and the baked treats were beautiful. plenty of outdoor seating as well from full sun to pleasant shade. why 2 stars? i pre ordered a vegan lunch and it was just laughably bad. it consisted of two bare rice cakes, half of a sliced tomato and a few bits of sliced cucumber. it was probably 100 calories of tasteless bits of food. they made absolutely no effort to make something decent. its as if no one has a phone with google."
"the rib eye was tough and cold, vegetables were scarce and not tasty.when we said that the meat was tough, they did nothing. people must know how this restaurant has deteriorated because there was hardly anybody dining, only a few having snacks in the terrace. it is a shame that they do not serve good meat but maybe trying to get rid of whatever they had."
"young couples, friends, families, everybody feels at home here. the staff is friendly and laid back."
they are true believers in mayonaise. mayo on my salmon. mayo on the broccoli. mayo covering my plate. mayo mayo mayo. kids menu is a gloried snackbar offering. my pasta looked sad and was crying for help and respect.

"the breakfast is in the average. a good choice of sweet and salt, and the quality is also in the averag "
"i have been here quite a fee times recently for business meetings, and the uitsmijter i had for lunch was the worst i had ever had. apart from that the service is appalling, every single time i have to get up and find a waiter to pay the bill, and then they have to find the waiter that served us to take payment, so that takes about 10 minutes waiting around. not impressed!"
"great breakfast buffet lots of choice and fine quality of products. dinner very big portions not so high qualit, i would prefer smaller portions and improved ingridients"
"we ate at van der valk houten on our way to the theatre in utrecht. the ambiance is quite impressive. we arrived rather early and service was attentative at that point in time. when it became busier, it started to slip away. when we got the sole that we ordered and which was cut by the staff, it turned out it had not been cooked well enough. when the bill came, i had the impression that it was more expensive than what i am used to and would expect from a van der valk. all in all, not bad but not impressive either."
"we were in this restaurant business wise and before the meeting we wanted to have a dinner. the menu is still elaborate with trendy looking dishes and names. the service is rather poor with students with no hospitality experience. the dished served consist of the fish or meat with ample serving of french fries. the fish dish ( vissers palet) was a variety of fishes mainly too salty pangasius fillet, scallops etc. with some rather poor looking garniture. for business ok but not a place to have a special occasion"
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10€ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"what can i say. unpleasant staff you have to call by ringing a bell (inside) as there is no service. a double espresso? two shots of powdered coffee i wouldnt give pigs price euro 4,60!!!!!! its that i had to wait for someone but this is a tourist trap stuck in the 70s apart for the pricing. no wonder it is so empty. if i was the owner i would upgrade or enjoy my pension"
we vist the pyramide van austerlitz on a regular basis. we always begin with one of the walking routes in the woods and round the pyramid then we end up in the big playground with our small children. there are enough things to choose from so every child has something to keep them entertained also in the summer months they haveaarcade a sort fairground with attractions such as a train and bumper cars. the restaurant itself is very old and self service the restaurant could be improved and the toilets need to be cleaned on a more regular basis because they always stink and look really dirty.
poor and shabby place with much potential. the place is literally 100 years old. there is a pretty cool playground and arcade hall next to it. the campings are very nearby and also the pyramide. a landmark built by napoleo

"bar and restaurant. i was here for lunch, and my 2 year old daughter and i were here alone for most of the time. maybe on other occasions its more lively. lunch was simple, service slow, and the setting was a bit dark for mid-day."
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (‚revenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"very disappointing diner. 4 meals were not ok. too basic and fish was definitely not fresh. when talking to the staf in a friendly way, the waiter became quite defensive and claimed every day they fresh ingredients."
"located between driebergen and doorn, the restaurant is favoured by my wife because of the beautiful out door seating in their well maintained garden. the food can vary widely from fabulous to not so nice, but in general the flavours, presentation and quality are better than avera "
"the restaurant looks nice, both garden and inside. the card promises much but judging by the little we ate, not really . we arrived at 19.30 a monday night, restaurant not even half full. three persons serving. two young girls and a gentleman that seemed to be the boss, only him took the bills. both the girls and the man disorganized, going around without paying attention to guests or having their own agenda, unknown . we sat at a table for two, just one napkin on the table. this was disregarded but we were asked at once what we wanted to drink. the waitress seemed to think that people should just drink wine by glass, seemed very astonished when my husband said that it is possible we order a bottle. she asked if we wanted merlot or pinot noir.... a little tired by the exchange we ordered two glasses of merlot, very average, and very little quantity. then we were left to linger over our wine about 20-30 min, our desperate tries to get some attention were cut short by the gentleman who plonked on our table two small rolls of serrano ham with goat cheese, and told us that we will get the menus but first eat this. a napkin for my husband was provided. the menus arrived by and by. i ordered a veal broth and a fish cooked in the oven sicilian style and my husband a ravioli and red fish(?) fried. after about 30 min our staters arrived. mediocre food, looked better than it tasted. and now our glasses were empty, we managed by and by to get some attention and another two glasses of red wine. and then another wait ....till 21.30 h when we were fed up and asked for the bill as we could not wait any longer. our empty dishes were still on the table...we paid a bill of 81€ for 4 small glasses of wine and two starters, one was noted on the menu 6,75€ , the other was about 10€. do not go to this restaurant, the lack of professionalism and the lack of shame in asking full price for an order that was delivered only half is unbelievable."
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.

"the restaurant/brasserie is a bit difficult to find, and you have to know it. it is the end of the road past de zandafgraving. so you do need some kind of own transport to get there (or walk). it is located on the top of the hill, near a small scale holiday pa "
"great coffee, average soup and sandwiches. slow service on a saturday afternoon, maybe due to a party. too expensive."
"the “de oranjerie” is located inside the park of the doorn huis, the ambience is charming and class; the service is friendly but not very quick; the dishes are well finished. very good solution for a brunch or a tea break."
"this restaurant is generally speaking excellent. i was very impressed in the past (before i was diagnosed with food allergies) by the creativity of the chef and great service, i would highly recommend it unless you have food allergies. i am gluten and lactose intolerant and thought they made good food for me, they served me cheap dry bread while my husband got an amazing freshly baked bread. my heart dropped, it did not seem like they were fair or well prepared. it was tolerated until dessert when again they served more options to my husband and i got a lame one with some dry almost burnt puffed rice to decorate the dish…..sorry, this does not fit the level of the restaurant. the cooks should be better prepared for fair options to people with intolerances, i reserved with details on my allergies and they did not deliver."
had dinner in this former brasserie. over the years the restaurant has really upgraded to fine dining restaurant. the service is professional and kind. the food is excellent and of high qualit 
you know instantaneously when you’re in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteur’s admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."

this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the ’smells’ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
"enjoyed a sit down dinner with fixed menu. it actually was good, but for the price paid, it was average. at this price point one would expect something much more refined and elaborate. the hfslg used to have one (from 1981 to 1986 even two) michelin stars, but this was lost in 2018. unfortunately for them, the very good meal that we had was indeed short of a michelin star worth meal. nevertheless, one can get an honest meal and the service is good, albeit slow."
"a beautiful restaurant, excellent service, but the quality of the food was disappointing. we regularly visiting michelin star restaurants in holland, germany, france, spain and japan, but the hoefslag is close to lose their star, as the food, the most important, was below the expectations. no dish was spectacular, a bit without fantasy, no 1 star michelin worth."
"have had dinner at the hoefslag several times the last year. it has been a top-class restaurant for very long. however, i was rather disappointed in the culinair experience. sure when you arrive you are received very courteously, the service is good, but never becomes personal, all more a routine then heartfe "
"after an absence of seven (!) years we - finally - revisited de hoefslag where we were married in a civil ceremony in 2008. so we were full of nostalgia and expectations, looking forward to a similarly sublime evening as way back when. our first impression was that not much had changed over the years; roughly the same decor and furnishings. this could have been reassuring albeit that it had all become rather shabby over time. one single bouquet of flowers unfortunately could not create an inviting ambiance on its own, especially when the view from the terrace includes a humongous, black pizza ov "
"we took our 13 year old granddaughter for dinner in the garden of bistro de ruif. nice setting for a warm evening, competent service, well prepared dishes. however, we were astonished- and more than a little put out- by the fact that we were charged 2 x €6 for 2 bottles of house (flat) water , i.e. tap water that is filtered in house (just like the water we drink at home). this is, in our view, unacceptable for restaurant where prices are already on the high side. the wine list is good, but expensive. when one spends €45 on a bottle of wine, one does not expect to have to spend another €12 on water! i dont think well go back."
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... don’t go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"went for a friday night dinner. small place with nice ambiance located in the center of veenendaal. we reserved a table (the place is not big) and ordered drinks and a three course menu. starter was tomato soup (very tasty) with smoked chicken and beer-battered fried mushrooms with walnuts and salad. starters were very good. thereafter we had chicken satay and white fish. compared to the starters these dishes were a bit of a miss. although presented very nice and good the taste was a bit bland. with a little more effort (marinating the satay meat and seasoning the fish) they could improve it. the potential is there! we ordered the creme brulee as dessert and the chefs surprise. very well portioned and tasty! all in all (for the price) we had an excellent dinner and enjoyed our stay. service was good and done by some young girls, we waited for the starter and they actually forgot us but the made the apologies and as we were not in a hurry it was all fine. so, for a good bite and reasonable price this is a good place."
"we had the 5 course surprise menu which included small dishes: one salad, one soup, one apetiser, one main and dessert. they were all okey but not all of them tasty enough in my opinion. the prices are good, the service is friendly but if you dont visit this restaurant, there is nothing you are missing."
"the food was cold and tasted like soap, server was simply rude, inside the burger the meat was still nearly frozen in the center. the fries tasted gross like someone had put a cleaning supply or soap on them absolutely awful, ate at mcdonalds many times, never again at this venue."
arrived here for lunch just to be told there is no babychair available and that the restaurant is not actually “ for kid 
this restaurant and bar looks more like an irish pub. drinks are good. staff nice. food is nothing special. the steak was basic and not tasty. hamburger looks great but test is ordinary. prices high. nice outside seating. a lot of other restaurants around.
"a lot of rats. the food was the worst i ever tasted, everything was dirty. and on top of that the service was awful. wouldn’t recommend."
words cant describe how trash the service is.  its a shame how they treat customers. if you want a horrible experience... go!
wouldn’t recommend !! they have zero respect for customers. they treat people like animals and if you say something about it they don’t appreciate it !! please don’t waste your money and time !!
"not even worth one star! if your black do not go! they will put your food on the ground, and tell you to pick it up! and if you say something about it ,they will call the police on you! im very dissapointed ,the way they treath black people is not right!"
"didn’t like my visit att all, food is trash. service not good att all. they are so mean to alot of people. so basiclly don’t waist your money. it’s not worth it."
"classical dutch pub. typical brown interior. we wanted a small lunch, and that is what they are good  "
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "
had dinner here with my wife and our 2-year-old daughter. stayed in the hotel (separate review 
"we ordered food, after paying they told the person that picked it up,  we had to warm it up ourselves. i called to complain and the lady at the phone was anoyingly unteachable.  unwilling to take blame.   what a disappointment…..  don’t go there."
this place looks great from the outside and has a pretty interi 
"restaurant looked so inviting on the website, but on arrival discovered a restaurant that was hazy and smelt awful from people smoking inside. decided to find another restaurant."
we were with a large family to celebrate someones birthda 
this an average (pancake) restaurant. pancakes are fine did not try the other dishes. it has a small terrace and pleasant service. not a place to go for fine dining.
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
we dropped by for a quick bite. it is at the centrum and close to oypo museum. the staff is very friendly.
"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"frankly a disappointing dinner,with our original reservation of table outside ,being rejected “ because it is friday night”. it is so hard to know how difficult covid makes matters,but in july 2020 this was at least open,clean and safe. hopefully standards will improve with experience."
"while asked the reception to turn on the heating in my room in the morning before my arrival, it was freezing in it when i arrived in the evening. since the heating system is more like a hair dryer on steroids as it jus blows out warm air of it, the room never became comfortably warm over night. and having the heating system blow air during the night wasnt a great thing either given the noise it created. bottom line: avoid the place if you are looking for a warm room during winter seas "
the chicken meal i had was delicious.  the beef soup was ok.  the sliced ham appetizer is a little squishy for my taste.  the shrimp appetizer was good.  nice views out of the window if you sit by them.
the hotel is located in the woods around the city. the beds are good and the rooms clean. only the price is a bit high and the restaurant is expensive.
"food was unpleasant and would not recommend.  english menu was very limited, you are not able to get the specials in english."
"we had planned to eat in rijssen itself, however after a heavy week and then a bracing walk in the surrounding woods we decided, after a quick look at the menu to eat in the hot "
"lunchroom t schild is a sandwich restaurant in the city center of rijssen. the positive side of t schild is, that there is a large outside sit-down area, where you can enjoy watching the saturday afternoon life in downtown rijssen go by. the service of the waitresses was a bit bumbling and unpolished; to be encountered in the netherlands unfortunately too often. the recommended home-made walnut cake was dry and nothing special and the hot ham and cheese sandwich my companion ordered, was obviously assembled in haste without sufficient care and served without appropriate cutlery.only the prices were in the expected (high dutch) bracket. i shall avoid lunchroom t schild in the future."
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
great location and nicely done restaurant. friendly staff. food is a bit ordinary though and therefore too expensive for what it is. a great spot for a coffee or drink without the hefty price tag for the food.
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i don’t know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"when we visit the netherlands, all our kids seem to want to do is grab something out of the febo wall. the febo wall is a wall where there are small windows where you can see snack . you pay the machine and open the window of choice and get the snack you paid for. this magical snack wall offers croquet, cheese souffle, frikandel. actually just fast food. it is fun to see how many people enter, choose, pay, grab a snack and are on their way. obviously, the food is what it is, junk food, but well.. once in a while we all indulge!"
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the table….. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . i’ve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
went here on a fridaynight after shopping for the holida 
"nice restaurant with good food. it want to be an upscale restaurant, but it isnt. the portions are small and the menu is not that great. choose for wonders or the other places nearby"
due to restaurant week rating we had dinner at restaurant. we dont understand the high ranking of the restaurant week because of the average quality of the main course.  nevertheless the service was outstanding and enthusiastic! conclusion: normal dinner with good price quality
"stroming is located at a nice spot in the shopping mall of heerhugowaard. it is a nice restaurant where many locals come to have diner. we had diner with friends and we picked this location because of a past experience. this time we were much less enthusiastic about the food. we sent a diet list way upfront to the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate that diet and of course they could. however, the implementation was awful and full of mistakes. between starter (which had some obvious mistakes) and main course i asked politely if they could pay a bit more attention to the diet of one of the guests. well they didnt. although the servants were friendly it cannot compensate the chefs ignorance. for the other people the food was kind of ok but not exceptional. the portions are rather small."
"relaxed atmosphere and nice interior. restricted oms are great and clean, but maybe that is because it is monday morning. however nice designed and clea "
"this is supposedly the most busy and popular restaurant in the area. when we arrived, the restaurant was quite full. there are limited food options and although its good, it isnt special either. (usual food yuo can get at virtually every dutch restaurant, such as sate, steak, pasta, pizza, some dutch style asian options like pad thai which for sure isnt like the real thing) service is slow. all in all its alright but nothing special."
i expected more from this restaurant. the atmosphere is good and the staff friendly. but. 
"i come in every now and then, but always suprised by the high prices. the wonders chain is nothing special, so the pricing is a bit off especially for heerhugowaa "
bit of mixed feelings after todays lunch at the heerhugowaard affiliate of the wonders restaurant chain. its located on a (not today) sunny corner of a giant new construction project that includes the biggest shopping mall in europ 
"the location is nice, with view to the water. we only had to wait very long for our drinks. plus point there is enough parking space."
"this restaurant is a restaurant that has good and tasteful food, but with a little bit of high prices. the service of the staff is oké, but not that special.this restaurant had a good location if you want to have a diner before going to see a movie, because its near the cinema. the choice of food is poor and i preferred some more options. i must say that what they served, tasted very nice. i chose a fish dish and it was prepared good. i enjoyed my time here and maybe i will go back again. "
this is one of these all you can eat restaurants that thrive on keeping you waiting for food - whilst serving you overpriced drinks..... euro 5.35 for a glass of wine 
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
"our last experience was not the best, me and my partner both had the burger from the menu. i asked mine to be topped with a fried egg and that was no problem. when the two burgers arrived at the table, mine was perfect and with the egg as requested, but my partner was not satisfied since her burger was very under cooked. we mentioned this and we were told that this was no problem to eat, since it was beef from the should "
visited this place with the family . food was oke not convincing but oke. the karma shoarma (vegan) 12 euro was in my point of view way overpriced 
we had an amazing party but the toilets were ridiculous. the ladies line was so long and they werent even using all the ladies toilets. girls were crying and the security was aggressive. i watched a girl pee in her pants and try to go through and the security stopped her. never mind the fact that there were atleast 5 open womens toilets when this happen 
"worst place ever. not too mention they’re expensive, that i can deal with. drinks in plastic glasses, fine. but having to queue 45(!) minutes to go to the ladies, that’s just outrageous. especially as you also have to pay for this ridiculously poor service! there’s certain standards that have to be met and propper access to toilets is one of the most important. if u cannot service your public then sell less tickets. this club tries to establish its self as upscale but in reality, it’s a dump. "
"nice for hippies our would-be amsterdam people, but nothing special. go north across the noordzee channel and you will find much nicer and authentic places..."
"quite a good meal, but having spent about 40 euros on 4 food items, a tea and a coffee, we asked for a cup of hot water, they refused. very stingy."
"we liked the menu and found the food of good quality. however, service was very slow even though it was not very busy. staff is friendly but does not seem to realize that they are there to serve customers. we had a nice table by the window and the interior is ok. but i can image if the restaurant is really busy you could probably listen in on the conversations at the table next to you. i would say that our overall experience is good."
"although we had made a reservation the booking wasn’t found. food mediocre, wine expensive, table too small, staff friendly. not worth a second try."
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"whilst the service was pleasant the food was not great. the goat’s cheese cannelloni was very heavy with thick pasta and the kale quiche was quite flavourless. my friend’s burger was also rather dry. this would have been forgivable until they allowed a couple to bring in their frankly enormous dog, which is bad practice for an eatery in my opinion. we were left unimpressed."
"nice, cozy interior - slow service - if their french onion soup is any indication of their cooking skill than 2 stars would be an overstatement. being busy at the time we were directed towards the bar (a tactic used in most countries) waited 20 minutes for a table although there were empty tables in evidence - waited another 10 minutes - and only upon request - were handed the menu. another 10 minutes went by for someone to take our order. when requesting a drink that we learned to enjoy on our german part of our tour we were told (although with a smile) that we were in holland now. all in all, one of our less enjoyable dinners while travelling holland."
"when you want just to eat a piece of meat (whether it is satay or beef tenderloin) with some french fries, go to cafe t hemeltje."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go. "
"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. it’s at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say “ignore visiting” and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and don’t bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so don’t mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
the food were yummy as always but had to repeatedly remind for all the items. unexpected rude behaviour by the staff these time around.
"we had a business lunch appointment and checked into this place without much further ado... had some great ham and eggs, with cheese on top -- not bad at all, some coffees and enjoyed the seaview on a windy and bit rainy day. that is all. there are 3 other beach bar/restaurants to choose from, we often prefer club zand to the others. but zeezicht is an average place. no surprises..."
"we often stop here to have a drink or so. volenteers serving, many playing and shouting kids, not much choice but ok for a soup or a drink. sit if the sun is out end enjoy. but not too long, beautiful nature around the corner (if not to many bikers and runners). relax!"
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosé disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didn’t have to fill in our details) they didn’t clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and it’s sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here 😉
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the saté meat was very d 
they advertise fresh farm fries. these are great and a real reason to come back as a regular. when its sunny thus busy they revert back to greasy factory fries which are not even cri 
location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
been there a few times and ordered something else every time. but sadly every dish was disappointing. it wasnt bad but it always had flaws. the location is cool. the personel is okay. sometimes they just close parts of the terrace wich is weird because it’s not nice to sit on every spot. they use way too much sauce imo.
we went there with a group od 16 people. the place was overheated and the service mediocre the food was less than mediocre.
my girlfriend and i went there for a small dinner just a sandwich or a starter we arrived at 17:00. we could only have small bites instead of something decent. crazy we had to wait for half an hour to order some decent food. we could also not have something of the lunch menu. besides it was expensive and service was poor. 
food qualitity very good but by far not enough.  service was okay but the food came really slow.  atmosphere was pretty good
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. don’t go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and it’s just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and it’s close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"we visited deining twice. last year, from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return her "
"lunch with some colleagues to discuss things in a nice location rather than a meeting room. we had a coffee outside and sandwiches inside. all good, service was friendly and efficient."
a really nice place as well as in good weather as in hard north sea conditions. beautyful fireplace and friendly service. the main dishes are not as nice as the rest and the pasta was more or less not eatable. just don’t try it
"from ordering to finally getting our food: deining completely screwed up. one out of 7 mains came before the starter, the starter was not what we ordered and then onwards it was one mess. all in all we waited for hours. we did get apologies and a free round of drinks but obviously i would not quickly return here. "
"we traveled from amsterdam to castricum to visit an old friend. we stopped here for lunch after walking on the beach. we sat inside as the sun was very strong. server was not very friendly but we got our drinks and food. we had salads and they were very good. when we had asked for still water and he was quite put off about it. otherwise a good meal, not busy during the week."
we went here on a great indian summer evening for din 
"went to the beach at castricum-at-sea, had a drink and a bite at deining. average food, friendly personnel. crowded and noisy, but hey, thats what you get at an beach inn."
"been there several times, always enjoying sitting outside. beware of the wind but nice place anyway and at least as good, maybe better than surroundings. but no really oustanding things to mention."
"for me it was the second time having dinner at this restaurant. what a difference with my first visit. it was known to the restaurant that we were there (7 guests) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. not one word was mentioned. the staff was clumsy with the wine and with serving after dinner tea. the owner/host never came to our table to ask if everything was okay. (this has been mentioned before in the lekker 500 magazine). the food was as it should be, but service and hospitality was disappointing."
"we have not been at apicius for a couple of years; a recent action draw our intention. however our renewed experience was not a favorable one: the hostess was quite clumsy (on our request if we could park a car nearby without being fined she answered: actually i dont know but you will find out sooner or later), the (excellent) white wine, was presented at room temperature instead of cooled, when we asked for some adjustments in the menu, this was received in a way that made us feel uncomfortable, without subsequent communication; the menu was fair, but not excellent or even creative; the beans tasted as if they came from the freezer instead of fre "
"the menu sounded very good but we found the food had no wow factor you expect from a restaurant with michelin stars. the atmosphere was poor, too many tables too close. i had a flower display taking up half my table placing that was imitation. not something i expect with fine dining. the whole restaurant needs updating, its cold with no atmosphe "
"only went once, but it was over-rated as far as we were concerned.  food was ok, service ok, but nothing special."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we came here for a quick lunch and we thought €12 for our meatball sandwich which wasn’t that tasty or special was quite expensive. the place is nice and the location is special.
"my wife and i ordered the catch of the day this was sea bass. this was two, uneven, filets of sea bass on spagetti with tomato sauce and raw bean sprouts. a fusion dish both bewildering and, frankly, disgusting. i think they should have warned us that this was a spaghetti dish. the fish was tasteless, so i gathered the tomato sauce was there to conceal this! we also ordered a side dish of roasted potatoes and salad. the salad was uninspiring and the potatoes were raw. the cost of the meal was around 70 euros and they offered a 10 euro discount. this did not take away the bad taste in our mouths!"
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the décor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
this is a very large buffet restaurant just off the centre of asten. it is on two levels as it has a mezzanine floor overlooking the main food counters. wouldnt recommend walking up and down stairs to get your food. stick to the ground floor. the selection is pretty much what you would expect of one of these places with a pretty good choice. the wine/beer/soft drinks are all included in the price of 26.50 e pp for a saturday night. there were a lot of children running around so obviously dutch parents dont have much control. there is a 2 hour time limit but if you cant have a meal in 2 hours something is wrong. no service as such its all self service.
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"if the chef’s wife is the hostess i would divorce her. he has a goldmine in his hand without het . food is gold, service with her is lead."
"cons: far from everything, somehow depressive. even far from everything, there is no mini bar or small refrigerator at room so you can buy something to the room. almost 0 facilities, no gym, no pool, really nothing, not even water at room. breakfast is poor and getting worst, they are reducing options even in bread. furniture and ambiance is dark. at the entrance smoker people has a comfortable sit so they pollute entering people with bad sme "
we ate here so we could see some world cup football. they had a big television insid 
"we come to this place once in a while and must say that food quality varies: we had multiple ocassions that food was not really warm, the fries bag not fully filled or invalid orders. but if you mention it, they will quickly resolved the probl "
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"het lieve leven serves rather good food, but the ambiance is very, very chilly. it starts already with the table reservation: the girl answering the phone is not really interested, just answers ok. decoration is rather basic: dark floor, no curtains, overlooking the highway. it all feels very chilly. fortunately i had a bussiness dinner, but as a couple i would never go there; a refrigareator has more atmosphe "
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
if you like dutch fried and deep fried snacks this is the place. but many times they got your order wrong and long waiting times. staff is not always that friendly but we keep coming back to this place.
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
"weve been to the flaming feather toverland, on october 23rd 20 "
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"stayed at the hotel for several days. the food was delicious and presented very elegantly with nice choices on both the a la carte and on the 3-5 course chef options. however, the service speed was painfully slow and wait staff seemed inexperienced and leaderless. restaurant was not busy with lots of empty tables but still was very slow taking orders and dinner took 3 hours+."
"dinner in a chateau. who doesnt want that experience. we had dinner at this hotel/restaurant. we choose the chef menu but decided to have three courses. after the amuse, which was nice, we had the sashimi of tuna. nice but a little overwhelming with different tastes. after the sashimi we had the trio of beef. a carpaccio, a filet americain and a tartare. very nice but the sizes were big. after the second course we had the livar (pork) and the cod. the cod was slicly overcooked and the livar dry. having higher expectations in advance voor the level if the restaurant, we were slightly disappointed. the service was very friendly and always willing to explain the course or the wi "
"we came as a business group (guests of the hotel château holtmühle) for a dinner after a long and exhausting day, rather hungry. the restaurant was somewhat busy, but it does not explain extremely slow service. it took us something around three hours to get food served. the food itself was nice, yet the whole joy was spoiled by the pace it was served. one doesnt expect two minutes of eating (degustation menu du chef - five small courses) and half an hour waiting for the next course. absolutely unacceptable. we regretted we did not dine at macdonalds that night."
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand café with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
we didnt stay a night at this romantic white castle but we did took a walk in the castle area. there is a walking route map in front of the castle by the parking area. its a beautiful castle to see.
"this could be such a lovely place to go to, but the staff just ruin everything. your drinks take ages to arrive simply rude in asking what your roomnumber is during breakfast. and the rooms are very basic. its good to sleep and the fact i have nt rated it poor is because its located in a beautiful surrounding (especially in the morning with the fog) "
"we stayed two nights in the hotel. the restaurant is convenient as there is nothing nearby unles you take your car. there is al limited choice and the menu is all right fot once but not for a second time as the choice is too limited. when busy the meat can be too far gone, juicy becomes more than medium."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
"this restaurant is located at the base of the wilhelminatoren, so location is perfect if youre visiting the area. its a big restaurant with a nice terrace. the menu is typical dutch and so was the food. we ordered a salad, a croque and a stew. all were ok but not special. same for the local beer. good for lunch, but wouldnt have dinner here."
"although, in netherlands under this corona crisis, you are allowed 4 people per table and tables only had 3 chairs, we were barked at but a very rude waiter, screaming at us that things are different than in belgium... making clear his disrespect for people outside of holland! i have no issue with directions being given in this crisis, but the way we were barked at, explicitly outlining being belgian is rude, disrespectful and deserves a strong review on this for "
"for the last day of may we decided to go to the 3 country area in the south of the netherlands. this is in vaals, limburg. the navigation system guided us through the city over the four borders street towards the first stop; wilhelmina tower. the tower was built in 2011. enterance costs 3 euro per person, small children are free. you buy a token to get there in the restaurant beneath the tower. here i had a scary experience as when i wanted to pay by pin i thought i had to enter the pin code but instead the device asked for the amount to add as gratitude. luckily it did not accept my pin code as gratitude; too much it said... but why? why asking for gratitude when buying enterance token "
it’s a beautifull restaurant at a top location. the coffee is tasty but can’t say the same about the food. especially the spare ribs were dreadfull. so if you’re just visiting to have a drink it’s ok but don’t have dinner there.
the estate is amazing! great view but the food could be better. i had shrimps on the rock (16€) and wasnt satisfied with what i got. shrimps were minuscule and one could tell theyve been in the freezer before. not worth at al 
1. the theme is good but a bit over the top. way too many pictures. 2. music is not matching the theme. 3. too many flies. 4. dishes taste ok but not looking good.
this restaurant is clean and food is reasonable and price is very good.  the inside is like eating in a church on church pughs.  nice atmosphere and unusual location.  overall good.
"the restaurant located in an old missionary serves a small menu with easy going meals and easy going service. very cheap and in accordance with the meal. not too fancy, but good to go. we had the local special zuur vlees which was alright. the restaurant closes at 8 pm!!! so be in time."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
"horrible waiter , she took her time serving us and even just giving us a menu , we ordered a starter and a main course and she brought it together?? why even add a starter if u bring it together its called a starter for a reason. when we called her over she even eyerolled at us 😬the pasta didnt have any cream and was filled with oil.. the burger was dry and bland and even the bread we ordered was bad i struggled to finish it just so i wouldnt feel like i wasted my money, worst experience ive had in vaals. i wouldnt recommend this restaura "
"a nice place to sit on the terrace, but the only table free was in the corner, so it was not practical to eat from when the main dish arrived, due to lack of space and being difficult to serve the hot dishes. hence we changed tables. took a menu, the steak was not very good, but the rest was decent. we wanted to try apfulstrudel for desert, as i saw this on the menu. but they said they had nothing but ice-cream. the desert was very simple unfortunately. i wouldnt recommend this restaurant."
"you can expect simple, but well prepared food. the prices are very agreeable. staff is very polite. the only point of attention are the flies outside on the patio."
"perfect place for a nice lunch, the staff take there time and are friendly. we enjoyed our soups of a chilly winters day. even though you sit on the heated veranda we chose to sit inside in the cafe."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the ‘reibekuchen’ were great. the ‘zuurvlees’ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
..i suggest to avoid this place and try somethingelse in the vicinity. the food is low quality and we didnt like the service also. i will not came back for sure!
"heading for the 3landepunt and we stopped for breakfast! all is prefabricated and pretty tasteless, even if quantity is large! nice decoration on the wall as it represents old news papers about the place and history about the borders! the waitress was helpful! however i would not eat here again! "
"the food is good, nice setting but slow service, good beer.  sorry but i would not go back..i was not impressed."
this is not the drielandenpunt ... its another km onwards. tower has no arrows or anything pointing out landmarks. drinks were expensive.
"the food is absolutely terrible. pasta was supposed to be fresh but was not fresh at all, pesto out of a jar, sour salad on the side, tuna sandwich with terrible tuna out of plastic box,… and pricy! way too expensive for food that is not at all fresh! 16,5 euro for ‘fresh’ pasta? 10 euro for a piece of bread with tuna spread?! we were with 7 persons and everybody left a plate with half eaten food. what a sad end of our family weekend…"
restaurant close to the 3 country point with a great view from the terrace. we ordered salads and fried eggs for lunch; average quality against a fair price and friendly service.
"we came to this restaurant for lunch on a rainy afternoon. there is plenty of covered, as well as uncovered terrace, but we chose to sit comfortably indoors. the service was very pleasant. the menu, though not large, offered enough lunch items. they have no salads, which is unusual. we all ordered a dutch pancake, and were unfortunately very disappointed. clearly neither the apple nor the cheese pancake was made on the spot. they were tough, even hard to cut. most probably they had been rewarmed in a microwave. what a disappointment, nine euros for a tough pancake. "
"for me it was clear that this restaurant depend on tourists and not people that return. it was a close call to giving only 2stars but the trout made the difference. being a fan of liver (especially with bacon and onions) the dish that was served was poor. liver was a bit chewy and a dish like this should not be served with strips of bacon. the waffle for desert was just ok, but they clearly used cheap cream and chocolate sauce. "
"this is a good stop when visiting the drielandenpunt. the view over aachen is very nice. its a relaxed place with friendly young staff and a playground for kids. good coffee. i was less enthusiastic about the food. pancakes were quite thick and tasted a bit stale, like they had been under a heating lamp for a while. "
"the uitsmijter is good, but the service is not that good. even with an almost empty place it took a while until we were able to pay. something that seems weird to me.  the view is great by the way!"
"nice location, nice panorama....structurally cozy environment but.....just for a coffee...or breakfast at maximum ....not advised for lunch....the menu is fully structured on pre cooked and artificial food .....have a beer....dont waste money in it"
"we were here with some friends to have lunch. i tried the schnitzel, which didnt please me. the meat tasted plane, there was some ham and cheese thrown on top and that was it. the fries were nice though, freshly cut in big pieces and crisply fried. there are better places for schnitzel around here, but my friends thought the salad there was good."
"nice location, nice decoration, with a wonderfull playing corner for kids. good service also. food is ok, but average price vs quality ratio. overall it worth a visit or two, specially with kids."
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
considering it is litterally attached to albert hein we didnt get the feeling of being near a supermarket. however if we had sat the near the large window / entrance it might have been differe 
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"we looked forward to our lunch here. very nice ambiance, great decoration of flowers, and cozy atmosphere. we all like a “long” lunch but we got here at 12:30 and left at 16:00. not because we were having such a good time, or great food, or lots to dink but due to poor service. it is the worst service experience i have ever had globally…the staff “disappeared” for periods on end. wine glass empty and me dying of thirst. from the seating to the whole meal it seemed like the staff had a big fight among each other and were not with it. according my guests the maitre’d was not present…which could make the differen "
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
"we stayed more then 2 h at table with two children for a 3-course dining. the food was ok, but more selfmade would be appreciated. my (varkenshaasje) had cooked to long, it should be rosé inside. overall it was tasty."
we liked the food but the wait between courses was longer than expected. portions and side dishes can improve. recommended if you are staying in the hotel or if you leave closeby
"dinner on both days that we stayed there. great recipes and cooking, but too many drawbacks to recomme "
"somehow not very organized. we made a reservation, but could not attract any waiter/ waitress to order a drink. the soup was overpriced (6 euro), and not special/fresh at all."
"nice atmosphere though tables are rather small. we had the venison menu. first course was carpaccio with i.a. qumquat, except that there was no qumquat. second course very tasty. dessert should have been tarte tatin, but proved to be a tasty bit of apfelstrudel. not bad, but should have been mentioned. wines selected with the courses were presented in an informal manner. in summary: not bad, could have been better."
"i come often to the hotel in avegoor (due to its location) and sometimes i dont want to drive out to eat so i go to their restaurant. each time i wonder what it will be like because the restaurant and hotel changes hands regularly and i have had, good, correct and disgusting meals. this time the experience was extremely disappointing. i was there with family and friends and their opinion wasn`t any more positive. across the room i heard a couple rave about the food saying to the waiter that they will be back and i thought to myself - am i so hard to please? or maybe do they know what fine dining is meant to taste like or what are they comparing this food to, macdonalds? the chips and sauces are not home made. otherwise the service was good and the location, especially on a beautiful day when you can sit outside, is great."
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"food is average or even below average. way too crowded, so nobody could keep an appropriate distance. overall very disappointing."
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. won’t be returning here soon."
mcdonalds nijkerk takes great efforts to enable the social distancing rules due to the corona crisis. despite busy times this went ok. the food was pretty bad though - for starters none of the big salads were available. the fries were way too salt. the big tasty burger was almost impossible to eat with sauces coming out on all sides.
"we came to celbrate y mothers 85th birthday on a saturday evening with a group of eleven familymembers. we were welcomed in a proper way, the restaurant is a cozy, though rather big room with many tables, also for larger groups and the service to order was rather adequat "
"nijkerk is a city close to amersfoort and has a number of restaurants situated in the centre.this restaurant is a 10 minutes walk from there, has a large terrace on the corn "
"compared to its fame in the area, the prices are moderate and the food is good to excelle "
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
its a bar / restaurant and has the foods you might expect. the quality is good and its a great place for a quick meal.
"combination of a pub and restaurant , but this is not a good combination at all: noisy , alcoholics on the bar. friendly personal , but terrible kitchen."
"i did like the place its pretty cozy and nice atmosphere the host is a little slow but the coffee is good not to cluttered. the menu had little like breakfast dishes to choose from but i still liked it, i still would recommend to try it. what they do have is a great variety of pies and pastries. "
i really like the atmosphere and location but would probably not go back to eat. the waiters came across happy and approachable. although the prices of are quite affordable. we ordered vegetarian burgers. the hamburger bun was a bit sticky and the (vegetarian) burger a bit moist and black at the sides. the burger came with potato chips instead of fries (which we expected of ‘hamburger with chips’). no veggie 
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"we went to the water sport shop in the area of marina horst. and as we still need two hours driving to our destination, we decided to get some warm drink from mccafe that just a three minutes walk from the shop. we also used the restroom. the cappucino was quite good. quick service and clean restaurant."
"after a long ride from the north, we came along for a cool drink. finally i took sundae strawberry. its quick, good service and the staff is very friendly"
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
"we went here to try out one of the many beers available which can be selected from an ipad. the beers were good and we decided to stay for dinner as well. everyones dinner seemed to be fine, good sized pub meals. my burger however was completely raw on the inside and the egg on it tasted burned. when i told the waiter he just responded with a short i can see that and walked off. no apologies nothing.. ill just buy the beers next door in the shop instead."
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"
"this restaurant is located nicely in the forest of veluwe, a very popular destination on a sunny summer day. it has an outdoor place t "
"food was of decent quality, enough  quantity and not expensive.  personnel was pretty fast and kind. decoration was nice too."
"the food is good, however not very special. service is also good. it can be a littly noisy, due to the accoustic, so be aware where your gonna sit."
"split opinions on this one. i guess expect what you pay for, which is average. we ordered in takeout over the phone and were able to pickup our delivery in 45 minutes. the food was almost finished when we arrived, nice and hot sti "
"we had dinner in this restaurant on our first evening of our stay. my husband had a steak tartare as a starter and looking to the meat it seems not to be fresh. i had a pumpkin soup, but did not taste any pumpkin at all. furthermore the risotto as the main course was just terrible (very dry) and i did not finish my plate. my husband has a meat dish, meat was good, but the side dishes were just very poo "
"we had two dinners here with a group of twelve. the first was, in terms of service, a smooth operation presided over by a maitre d’ who knows what it is all about. the food: i had coquilles, two of them, well cooked but in a very uninteresting arrangement. the ribeye that followed was too raw in the middle, which made me realize i had not been asked what my preferences were. my omission also. it came with a salad with a dressing in the bottom of the bowl which made me wonder at first whether they had forgotten to add it. very good french fries. dessert: creme brulee but not with the essential breakable brulee. the next night service was below par. large party next door was the explanation. but also a waiter who took liberties and addressed members of my party in an inappropriate way. tensions between waiters and guests showing. food ok-ish, but taking a really long while to appear. not the happy gathering it could have been and where we were there for. not recommended for those who need a spot for a romantic dinner or a family get together. it shows that you are part of an operation focussed on large conferences."
the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost €12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than €1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for €12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
waiting time too long. starter was just a sort of beetroot ‘coulis’. not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. main course of fish ..the fish was too soft and cold and probably defrosted. chips excellent. expensive meal . pleasant service but food quality unimpressive. 
"we ordered a simple meal, sate menu with salad and fries. the chicken was just done, but still very white. the sate sauce was very thin and runny. the fries and salad were ok. the restaurant also feels old and run down. would not eat here again. "
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
for the prices they charge you would expect a lot mor 
"had dinner with friends at the pizza part of the restaurant. ingredients were not fresh, mostly out of a can. crust was good though. a lot of mistakes were made by the owner, who seemed overwhelmed on a not so busy night."
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual “fries” restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
only pavilion on a beautiful beach.  adventurous menu and great service.  we thoroughly enjoyed a long lunch.  unfortunately most of us ended up with stomach trouble later in the day.  so pls check your kitchen.
visited this restaurant today and decided to try something different: pad thai. quite a disappointment and does not even resemble the original thai recipe. ambiance and services are good though
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
"nice atmosphere, cozy and a bit fancy; nice waiter, but food was a bit expensive,  quite disappointing and not what we ordered (of course was more expensive)"
"if you need a bite in a hurry go there. not bad, not special, average pricing. friendly staff. close to a street with lots of people on bikes.  a rental shop for bikes is next door."
"there is a large terrace and a smaller inside part. decor is a lovely blue and there are lots of coffee specialities. service was good, pleasant place to take a break."
"well, we were recommended this restaurant by our hotel, so we took the 30 minute bike ride to the beach to try it o "
"this place is situated on the beach, so the scenery is ok. also the the decoration is fine. and there it stops. the food is not good, served not warm enough, the steak commes with cranberry and unions, but that combination needs more then just baking. the fish was very fat, probably baked in to much butter and served with north sea shrimps, which were not cleaned, maybe appropriate for gamba style shrimps but not for 15 little dutch buggers! considering the quality of the food and its overpriced. would not return here"
"we visited this restaurant on july 26th with two families - four adults and six children. after not being seated for approximately 15 minutes, we asked a waiter for assistance. he rudely responded that he was busy and would get to us later. after being seated, we ordered water and drinks. the same rude waiter gave us a hard time for ordering water because “they dont make money on water”. after asking for a drink from four different waiters and being ignored in all cases, i complained. the same rude waiter proceeded to get into a verbal altercation with me in front of my famil "
"looks like a very nice place. unfortunately we will never know. i was traveling with family. our group was 4 couples, my wife and myself and 3 retired couples over age 65. upon arrival there were 2 tables of customers seated out of 10 outdoor tables. one seated party was 4 persons and the other a party of 6. i asked for a table for 8 and was directed to a table for 8 by the owner. immediately after we sat down the owner came back and asked us to lea "
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.
"now, from a restaurant located in a marina you’d expect that they are used to handling large groups from, say, some incoming leaders yachts. but when we moored, and visited the terrace with a group of 50 persons, the staff freaked ou "

"disappointing, very small portions (seabass was two pieces of 3 by 3 cm only), expensive and quite fat (3 spoons of mayonaise on the frisian carpaccio). we expected more from what is stated to be a michelin bistro."
"this is landgoed lauswolts house bistro which is situated round the back of the hotel and reached by a trek alongside the kitchen and its associated service area. not knowing quite what to expect, we turned a corner to find that the place was absolutely rammed with just our reserved table remaining. we were handed a large menu, in dutch (fair enough,) and left to get on with i "
"we had a superb diner at this place two years ago, which was the reason to stop here for a second time. we found out that the place has new owners and also the kitchen changed .... unfortunately. it is an easy small menu, nothing special and the food was just ok. it took for ever until we where served and for us not a place we would come back.

"the terrace outside this hotel is very nice on a sunny warm day, so we ordered a simple lunch of cheese toasties. unfortunately it took a long time to come and when it did the meal was cold with the melted cheese congealed and unpleasant."
this is the second visit we have made to this stunning location. arriving by boat we are made to feel welcome and were offered a reservation for din 
"nice outdoor dining by the motor yachts. food was good, not great. service was good despite our language barrier."
"we are a group of friends on a boat and wanted to have a good dinner out . the food was good but the service absolutely lousy . not friendly at all , no smiles .. just a very grumpy attitude ."
"we ate here after a long day of travel.  dined on the special, which was a doner type meal not as good as doner joints."
"the location is not special, the decoration is ok, there is enough and free parking in the surroundings. the service was terrible, the waiter asked (2/3 of the table customers) if we fancied something to drink without even handing the wine menu, to the other 1/3 nothing ever was asked for anything at all, 30 min after sitting there and waiting no waiter nor the management came to the table even though our faces clearly showed our discomfort. the menu seemed interesting, i guess we will never know....."
"when we arrived we were greeted nicely and were sat right away. once we place our order thats when it went down hill. it took over an hour and 15 min to get our food. the food was ok, i had better from a fast food place. i live in germany so i am used to dinner taking awhile but this was horrible. will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone."
i’m at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
"this mansion was advertised as a pleasant and welcoming lunchtime stop during a countryside hike. unfortunately we were rather dismissively told that we could not be served anything, not even a coffee, due to lack of staff (dispite visible evidence to the contrary). hikers are obviously not regarded as welcome guests. avoid."
after almost 8 months the menu is still the same. bit boring now even though the interial is fantastic and so id the terras.
"its a beautiful setting and ive been here many times, both on leisure as well as on business. lately ive found them to be inflexible. with a business associate for lunch asking if its possible to have scrambled eggs instead of the normal eggs that are on the menu.......not possible. even after explaining the simplicity of things here and how this makes no difference when cooking....the answer remained n "
"several rooms to sit one area like kids area and unfortunately our table is there, but after 20 minutes we could move. menu is lots of variety and they use lots of local products good wine by glass and young staff"
great place to sit outside and have a nice drink. for eating ? i would not order again. dissapointing and expensive
"we ordered the zeewolf, smokey ribs and lamshoulder. the zeewolf was way too salty and had to be returned and a new one was served only ok. the smokey ribs to dry and little flavor, finally the lamb shoulder was shredded and the taste was barely ok. sorry but they must have a new chef. during the past few years every time i visited my mother i took her there, this was the last time. there are better choices in town, one of them jasmyn which has great food"
"the food was good however, a bit to pricey for european standard "
"had dinner here several times, sometimes its great, other times its too fat or not so tasteful. the same goes for the service, its rather expensive. i really like the large kids corner, very handy with small children"
"this grand café adjoining restaurant seems to be the hot spot in the small but upscale(-ish) village of abcoude. accordingly, it was jam-packed on a sunday afterno "
"this was my first time in a long time i have eaten here. this time we were with a group of twenty guests which was a bit to big for the little space. this evening there was live music at the bar. the music was so loud we could barely hear each other. the nice waitress messed up my main dish order by serving a black angus steak instead of a chicken sateh. i did not make a big deal of this mistake because i did not wanted to wait longer for my main dish. i did not regret my decision because the blackberry angus steak was one of the best steak i have eaten. because of the messed up order and the loud live music i rate this restaurant as average. maybe next time with less people, no messed up order and no loud live music i will give a better rating."
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "

"good middle class hotel. very often dance and party in the backroom-no problem for guests. romoms rather small and not to new, but all is there. showgrössen was leaking, seems nobodys problem. stayed one week-showergel, tissues and so on was never stockt up, pity. staff friendly, breakfeast nice. "
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast €12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars. "
visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!

"we have been visiting hillegom for years, and this relatively new restaurant is one of several owned by the same people. it is a retro design, modeled on a nearby art deco building, which is pleasant. most of the dining was in an upstairs balcony, looking down over the salon or bar area. only part of the upstairs was open, and a good thing too as there was only one server for the entire place and she was extremely bu "

"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
good traditional dutch food and atmosphere. is is a pub dutch style plus restaurant. drinks are excellent: good choice. food is good and big portions. you have to make a reservation in the weekends. thursday night specials are advised!
"we had a family dinner here. make sure to check if it is a busy bar evening - to avoid too many drunk people. the food was great, but i was uncomfortable with the crowd at the bar."
"i frequently visited the restaurant, which always has been a nice experience. since corona has been there all restaurants were closed and it has been a hard time. now corona is slowly disappearing we are ready to continue life. restaurants have very different policies, but naast de buren sadly has showed most corona-proof, which made the visit rather unpleasant. since the restaurant host more elderly people itmight be good, but it i would not recommend it to younger generation people, especially not families. there is a strict table setting of maximum 3 people, while neighbouring tables are still close. the service is still as normal, without use of a side table or so. you are not allowed to walk of your table. it all felt pretty uncomfortable. we also had to wait pretty long for the desert and so. i hope things soon turn normal for them, because it is the first restaurant i had a bad experience during corona times."
"we stayed for a night in one of the larger rooms @ € 130. yes, the room is larger (5x5m), but the bathroom is tiny (1,5x1,5m) with a defunctioning light above the washbasin. tapestry in the room may have a shampooi "
"since it was a week of a school holiday, lots of hotels were fully booked. therefor, i had to find a hotel in the region and found this hotel on the internet. i have booked two nights, but i left after one. for business, this is not the right hotel: very poor or no internet connection, since you are in the middel of nowhere. also, no mobile connection! the employees of the hotel were nevertheless very helpful by installing a television in my room since there wasnt one (since i could not work, i liked to watch a champions league soccer match) . diner and breakfast were good. all and all, i think this a nice hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet with your partner, but not for business!"
nice but far from spectacular. have eaten in a lot of michelin star restaurants all over the world or “mentioned” restaurants from the guide so maybe my expectations got in the way. i wasn’t surprised by anything served. service was great wine paring as should be but overall the experience was below even one star. (personal opinion) desert as per picture an overkill. it didn’t leave you with the pleasant feeling as it should have been. i will not be back.
"very good, professional and friendly service. the dishes are beautifully presented and show a lot of technical skills. so many different dishes with every course, many excellent on their own but no balance in overall dish. most times in great kitchens less is more. wine list which is overall poor and many selections overpriced. for me not a two star."
"we entered with high expectations, but were quickly disappointed. the interior is kinda blunt and closed, acoustics allowing you to hear every word of what is said at the next table. the service was a little cool, and even though prices are very reasonable, wed like to know what we will have to pay in advance - neither the drinks, the lunch menu or the coffee were priced beforehand. food was good, but quite salty and not all food combinations worked out well - my taste buds wrangled a long time with the different flavours they were exposed to. done quite a few michelin star rated restaurants lately, but there seems to be some discrepancy here."
"the food at this place is pretty good indeed. something to be expected obviously, when going to a star restaurant. especially the fish specialities (fruit de mare) and the vegetarian hotdog were super! it is a real fishy place and it does incorporate the local specialties really good. nevertheless, compared to other restaurant in this class, i was a little bit disappointed. i had to ask for my wine, the vegetarian options were often a bit somber in comparison to the real dish and it was not really clear when the menu finished, since we were not asked for coffee or tea. not sure what happened and i do expect something different from a high-range restaurant. nevertheless, we did totally enjoy the evening from 7 to 12! in that sense it was totally worth the money."
"this really was a waste of money! we like good food, go out to restaurants at least once a week and dont mind to pay more when it is worth it. our first experience was on the apartment, see the review under hotel. this was equally if not more disappointing. then the meal: to poor a very spicy sauce over good oysters doesnt make them better but that can be my taste. then the most annoying thing was the amount of alcohol they pored as part of the wine arrangement. i presumed that the amount would be so that you can empty all the glasses in line with the diner. especially at a star restaurant they should think about this. but if you have a starter, 7 dishes, and a dessert, and at all of those you expect your guests to drink a very full glass of wine, i dont think you know your business. this means 2 bottles per person! and if you dared not to finish your glass they left it at the table. so at the end of our meal with 4 people the whole table was full of half empty glasses. and although i can stand some alcohol i am not sure what the dessert was anymore. for me this means you dont know what you are doing and dont care about your guests. after complaining afterwards by email they also didnt care at all which made it even worse."
"we headed over to de kromme watergang for lunch, taking advantage of the restaurantweek menu on offer. basic menu price came to € 42.50 per person, which is of course a steal for a 2* place. additional courses were charged at € 24 per course, which is in line with what youd expect at a 2*. so far, so go "
"de kromme watergang is close to the top of the dutch culinary olympus, hence the hope and expectations of our group-of-five on an unforgettable eating experience were high. well, the bill ran well over 600 euro for a 5 person lunch, so at least that part was in line with the expectations, but alas that was about it. food is excellent of course, but that is, at 2 star level, not enough. two dishes with cod and flounder were too small and not very special in taste nor texture. the combination of pork and eal was surprizing, but again very small. the wine tasting arrangement was also served in un- generous volumes and the wine choises were rather middle of the road. i guess it must be the adria tricks with mousses and foams that have lifted this restaurant to 2 star level, but as customers start to see through this, a re-evaluation and return to real value for money, is imminent and restaurants like this one will have to adapt or die. all in all the kromme watergang provides a formal, but not very warm and generous welcome. we wont return."
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.
friendly welcome and a nice location are the only two positive things i found about this plac 
- a limited choice menu-card.....1 for lunch & another for dinner. printed on paper and worn-o 
"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"this restaurant has a lovely location and to sit outside would be very pleasant on a sunny day. the interior is very interesting but can be noisy. food was fine without being special, but the service (by, i presume, the manager) was unfriendly, bordering on rude."
my wife and i visited this restaurant with high expectations but left dissapointed. the food was ok but the place felt very stuffyand you feel you have to whisper as there is virtually no atmosphe 
nice location on the edge of blaricum natuur reserve the restaurant has a nice pleasant cosy feeling with a nice terras overlooking the heather fields . food is well presented looks good but is not always freshly prepared . when busy service is slow
the atmosphere is a bit stiff and the service overdon so it feels not relaxed. the location is great for walks! rather expensive. not good for vegetarians. this is a typical dutch place. could be so much better.
"its a pity really, de goede gooier has everything going to be a very good restaurant: spelendid location, perfect setting, nice ambiance, good cook(s), if only the staff would try a little harde "
"very little to say since we did not have a meal, but the service was friendly and the coffee/tea good. ideal place to visit after a nice walk in the nature area next door."
on our first visit after the refurbishment the kitchen proved to be as good as ev 
"deciding to have a quick drink and some food in blarcium, we decided to go to moeke spijkstra. havent been there for a while as the last time it was avera "
orderd mint tea followed by an uitsmijter and salmon club sandwich.  both were prepared simply and tasted good.  reasonably priced and service adequate.
"moeke spijkstra is an authentic local haunt, great for locals, and also for visitors. the ambiance is as traditional dutch as can be - dark brown interior, as vincent van gogh might have experienced it, and persian rugs on the table. it feels warm and cosy, and there is plenty to look at. dont be fooled though, the clientele, typically in their 30s and 40s, are mostly television and advertising industry crowd. not a very welcoming and open lot. the food varies. our mussels were of very high quality and well prepared. also the fries were tip top. "
this restaurant is located in the very centre of town and thats the nicest about it. the dishes are ok but could do with a major overhaul on both presentation and quality!
"nothing special, very overrated, you probably have to belong to the incrodw to apreciate it fully. average"
"a very known pub among the people of blaricum and surroundings. here you can find unknown and known people, young and old, boy and girl. its a nice cosy pub. the dutch often call such a pub a brown cafe. a small town pub. they serve also food and i like the especially the sate. its not a top restaurant but a pub where you also can eat. if you want to eat on a friday or saturday, make sure youre in time and make a reservation. it could be busy. "
"we visited this place twice just recently, and unfortunately on both occasions i was not impressed with the food. here are some examples: pieces of warm bread which we received before food - were actually half frozen. pumpkin soup - i couldnt taste the pumpkin, it was more like a cooked sour cream of an orange colour. french fries - rather tasteless. i only enjoued the burger, and garnalenkroketjes - but why so expensive?!"
"in my opinion i can only say the restaurant has gone completely downhill. we went for a dinner this evening there were only four couples in total the entire evening, so not exactly rushed off their fe "
"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didn’t expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menù in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, it’s so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "
"- friendly, correct waite "
"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."
having lived in this village we went back for lunch without reservati 
i visited this place more often in the past. had not been for a long time but went here with the team (20 of us) in octobe 
"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
"this is an eetcafé old style. pub grub plus. with old style i refer to the food that is dripping with rich butter and vegetables a bit overcooked. however, the atmosphere is that of a local pub (good) and the beer is cold. not a place to go for fine dining but great for a quick dinner with steak and fries. not absolutely cheap, but hey, this is the heartland of very wealthy blaricum: the richest village in the netherlands on average income of its inhabitants. so do not complain."
its a brown cafe. its pretty noisy and limited choices of food. personally i dont like eating in- nor outside the restaurant on the small terrace.
this restaurant has a very nice feel to it and was very welcoming - pretty relaxed atmosphere which was good as we had the kids with  
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (€12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
food was decent the rest was more then terrible… service was the worst i ever had… menagment have big mouth so are the people working here… not recommend..
worst restaurant ever! we ordered a few dishes and then a different family arrived. after a hour they got there food and we still didn’t get any. i don’t recommend this place.
"the weather on this februari afternoon was inviting for a nice walk along the beach. after this walk we settled down in the outdoor seating area of strandrestaurant ff tijd. as the sun was shining, we had a nice sit down, albeit with our coats on, with a nice view of the beach an a calm sea. nothing could go wrong for a three point rating now, despite the prices of the simple drinks and food through the roof, the funny taste of the latte macchiato and the staff who clearly didnt enjoy their job. "
we ordered a simple “broodplank” and waited close to 30 min! ridiculous. the only plus is the proximity to the beach
"this is your average beach bar, nice to sit and have a drink. the kids love that they have a bouncy castle."
"nice location, friendly people, but expensive, the wine could have a bit more for the amount they ask for a gla "
"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, don’t even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
the fries taste good. you can make a healthy deal with yourself: first walk to the end of the wavebraker and afterwards you deserve a fat snack ;)
"the staff is unpleasant, the food very expensive, tasteless and too greasy... i would definitely not recommend this place, or just for a drink !"
"terrible experience!! food was absolutely horrible! not cooked, appetizers came after the main course!! you need to call them like 2-3 times before they show up ( only 5 tables, with 4 service people)!!! and they have the nerve to charge, 4 stars restaurant prices!!!! they deserve minus 1 star!!!"
keep going until you find some other place!  it was expensive and really awfull! we were waiting 1 hour for the food and no credit card was accepted.
"this is your average beach bar. nice to sit and enjoy a drink in the sun. food is fine, but nothing out of the ordinary."
casual warm lunch offered by friendly staff. croquet and french fries and good selection of beer and wines.
"i liked the setting right on the beach, the weather was very nice and the food was fine. then came the bill and i did not initially notice it but when i looked closer they had charged me one euro for mayonaise that i had not even asked for. a very sneaky way to make some extra money and im sure most people do not even realise and just pay the bill. i pointed this out to the waiter who then became quite arrogant but did give me the one euro back. now this is not whether or not people can afford an extra euro or not, this is about the principle of charging people for something they did not order. not impressed and for that reason i will not be going there again."
"i had dinner here with my wife on a nice summer day. we sat outside which was nice. the food was good, but the service was somewhat slow. overall it was nice and i would give it a 7 out of 10."
"always when the sun is out the beach is crowed. the place is super cool, cosy and nice decorat "
"we had lunch here in august on a rainy day. we had a grilled cheese sandwich, prepared in a pan. nice, but to greasy for my taste. next to that we had ginger cheese pancakes which was delicious. friendly, quick service."
i was there in the weekend for a friends birthday. myself i have an gluten allergy and a friend has an intolorran 
"the restaurant was recommended as “the place to be ” in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
we went to this place based on reviews and drove a good 30 minutes to eat here one evening. we both came away feeling disappointed after €110 meal for 
"the food is tasty and varied, but the idea to share dishes did not work for us. the brazed pigs cheeks with risotto had 5 nice meaty cheeks, but hardly any risotto. more risotto can be ordered separately as a side, but that brings the price to 20 euros. the stoba stew was mostly sauce and could have done with a staple. the naan bread on the menu is not the same as naan in england. as a thin pancake/pitta it was very little as a starter. so we left a bit hungry. having said that, the view towards the water and all the big boats going by is great. "
"excellent ambience and food let down by sharers pricing and relentless attempts to up-sell. ended up paying over €50 for small dinner, one small mineral water and one minute coffee. we did not ask for bill but over-efficient service left us feeling ushered out."
well the food was ok. had to ask for menu etc so service a bit slow. but it now has a order a few starters and mains to make a meal - but thats not what we wanted as we both like different food

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"just after a long period of closing, because of corona, this restaurant started up. wher they usely serve a buffet, they now have plate service. the portions were very different: the sate was huge (almost for 2 persons), but the burger was tiny whitout any vegetables. my salmon was juicy en enough for 1 person."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my saté (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
"ok looked and smelt ok, spoke in english to someone who thought the best way to communicate with me was to shout at the top of his annoying voi "
"i accept that i cannot speak dutch but i would have thought that a seafood restaurant would understand what is meant by “fish and chips”! the young man serving seemed incapable of taking this order. i managed to place and order for calamaris but the second meal of “fish and chips” seemed beyond his comprehension despite a helpful dutch person trying to assist. finally by pointing i managed to place an order for the 2 meals which cost some £35.00!!! then when i tried to pay using my credit card i was told they don’t accept credit cards. however the machine refused to accept my debit card also! at this point having come to the end of my tether we left in disgust. we had spent the previous 10 days travelling through the netherlands, germany and poland and encountered no difficulties so why this fish and chip shop which is directly by the ferry port to england has such a problem with an order for “fish and chips” completely eludes me! i was also surprised that the senior staff working behind the counter gave the young man no assistance at all. i will definitely not return. "
"delicious fish. beautiful view on the waterway. its typical dutch way of preparing fish, which i love."
"we waited for around 50min. for 3 portions. there is no process and service. also the quality is very minimum, not what you would expect when going to such a place."

"vispaleis is a nice name, but it does not really match with reality. its more or less a luxury fish and chips-store. nice for a sunday-afternoon bite with the family, but not for intimate dining. a fishy snackbar..."

we were early for our boat back to england and thought wed have a meal before getting on the boat. the homemade speciality burgers at over 12euros were awful & probably bought at the lidl next door. my salad was very average - with chicken straight out of a packet & slapped on the plate. being charged 50cents for a glass of tap water was really mean - even the best restaurants we visited in the netherlands have never done th

"visited the restaurant with my family. the place looked ok. the food. the vegetarian option, stereotype goatcheese salad, wasnt tastefull. the much dressing. the goat cheese was weird. my daughter had a pizza, which was not well baked. the tomato soup was also not good according the youngest one. the pasta vongele tasted like it was baked in pan with me "
"food is good, waiter service is mixed. some waitresses or waiters are very friendly, while others are more formal. i think this is because the beachclub relies on the weather and seasons and therefore the personnel is probably switched more often. prices are average when compared to other beachclubs in the area."
"not often that i write a review for a below average place. staff here work at a snail-like pace and is generally not very capable (mess up an order and rather than fix it, blame a colleague). drinks took 12 minutes to arrive (busy beach day, but still). if you can avoid this place, do."
"yesterday i visited this place for dinner with my family. the waitresses were very kind and the music was nice. overall the mood was relaxed and good. unfortunately we had to wait about half and hour before we could order, because the kitchen was too busy. because of this we took as starter the olive- and brown bread with aioli and tapenade (which was great btw, very juicy olive bread) instead of carpaccio. the main dishes were, indeed, like those of an expensive snack bar; standard flavors and tough steak. it was the same for desert, i had the grand desert; the chocolate cake was dry and the chocolate mousse powdery. the only good thing was the look and the sorbet ic "
"arrived at beach mid morning, after overnight ferry and this seemed one of the first beach bars to open. myself and my daughter ordered; drink, burger and chips. enjoyed the drink and chips! burger was cheap, but ok. then my daughter showed me her bun, which had mould o "
"bitterballen were nice. vlammetjes (springrolls) were too oily. chicken sate, the sauce was terrible. drinks were good and all the staff were friendly. just a place for a drink."
staff wasn’t very nice and the food wasn’t great either. i highly recommend you to visit another place to eat.
"quick, friendly service. the food was well to eat, not high quality, partly products from the freezer, like the firy grilled cheese sandwicg and the satay. the sfere was good."
"we ate here for an early breakfast - one of the few places available. wed eaten here before and had a lovely welcome and delicious food. on this occasion the welcome was fine (but less enthusiastic) and the food was poorer - so were were rather disappointed. most specifically those who ordered scrambled eggs were served chopped fried eggs on dry toast. service was reasonably fast. it is quite popular, filling up quite a lot whilst we were there. well probably eat here again, and give them another try"
"we had as usual a lovely time, took a while to get served our first drinks but after that it went ok. hubby had nice carpaccio, i ordered the calamari, was ok. but you would expect it to be fresh and not bought from the wholesaler. as i can buy it from the same place . but its a beach tent so except it. will come back, but order something else. "
"we were here last week when it was relatively quiet. sat outside in the terrace but it took 3 servers going back and forth before one finally took our drink orders. we found this to be very inefficient. went inside to order dinner and it took an hour for our meal to arrive. calamari was good, bread basket was nice, beach burger was ok, the mussel dish was disappointing. the mussels themselves was nice but the broth where it was cooked in was so sour, that you cant dip your bread in it nor eat the mussels that was swimming in it. complained to the server but just got a ill pass it to the chef response. no further reaction and no apologies received."
"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "
"as a family of 5 who live in the same house and are a household, we were allowed into the restaurant terrace but only on a table without cover. the outside terrace (with cover) had still several tables available, but according to the waiter those were only available for couples. when it started to rain we could no longer sit outside without cover. we asked to sit at a different location, where 2 tables could be merged. this was not possible according to the staff. we were forced to leave when the rain became unbearable. no other option was discussabl "
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"i’ve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didn’t really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"we enjoyed lunch at this place while sitting on the town square. my husband had the fish salad, that was really excellent. my mom had the asparagus soup which unfortunately had ham/bacon in it and shes vegetarian. both kids had a smoothie and a tosti, all fine. i had the vegetarian sandwich with hummus, and vegetables and then they added cheddar cheese. that simply does not go together. the bread was good but the sandwich was not great."
"arrived for a late lunch around 15.45 with a group of eight people & the staff took their sweet time to take our order. by that time (16.02) we were told that the kitchen would not be serving food after 16.00! if the waiter had told us that the kitchen closed at 16.00 we might have place our order immediately with the drinks order or gone somewhere else instead of wasting our time! the worst of it was that four of the group were guests there & were checking in, which was also why we waited to order. plus it was two minutes past four oclock, not really an issue for the kitchen i would have thought. very disappointing customer service."
"the restaurant is in a charming old building. the food was just not very well prepared and we did not like it very much. a huge portion of very salty smoked salmon as a starter, it was ok, but not the best quality, and as a main i had a pasta dish, which really is not to be recommended. other people at the table had fish, which looked ok, but was rather boring: it was fried fish, without anything added to it."
"we ate here with a coupon deal, fixed menu with a few choic "
"the beer was served by a lovely attentive waiter. we sat outside in comfortable chairs enjoying the sunshine. we did not have a big appetite so we shared three pieces of brown bread with fried egg, roastbeef and potato sausage. a bad choice. it was ok quality but a weird mixture."
"we stopped here for lunch on a sunny sunday, and there were plenty of people sitting outdoors enjoying the good weather. we all got toasties (look for the paw print in the bread!) as well as a beer. for lunch, it was a fine combination, but unfortunately service was slower than it should have been for such a simple order."
"always a busy venue but unexciting & rather expensive lunch food. i had a tosti which was awful, great presentation with a dog paw print embossed on the sandwich but the filling was hugely disappointing. how can you mess up a toasted sandwich! i would maybe go back for a beer but eat elsewhere!"
"we were there end of february 2014 for a homebrewed beer: kareltje. that is very tasty but a little expensive for o,25 l: 3 euro. friendly service, salties free and a nice little museum upstai "
"we visited this eetcafe with another aussie couple during june. it has a limited menu, friendly staff and a great atmosphere. meals ordered were spare ribs, which were very good, and the local fish, kabeljauw, which we thought was cooked well but not very flavorsome."
with a group of friends we had lunch and it was okay food. a club sandwich with chicken means thick bread with very thin and few slices of chicken. the others had much better food so perhaps do not take club sandwi

"the restaurant is now named ons gheluk. we had a three course meal a la carte. the soups and carpaccio were nice. as main course we had codfish which was really good. for dessert we had a scroppino, cheese platter and chocolate soufflé. all delicious. the restaurant itself was a bit crowded and noisy. we had a nice evening."
"its 6pm we stepped in and two employers were dining. we waited for 10 minutes for the menukaart. the cafe interior was pretty; however, the food were in small portion, not tasty and expensive."
"a quiet sunday evening with only four tables being sat at...you would think our food order would come on time! the waitress did apologize & our table was given more bread but service, on the whole, was halfhearted. the food was mediocre...my veggie strudel, a  chef specialty was literally two stalks of asparagus with goats cheese wrapped in pastry....not inspiring. another guest had pepper sauce where the peppercorns would have snapped a tooth! so, on the whole, not somewhere i would rush back to...as the title says ~ disappointing."
"bad food, dont go there. food was dated and frozen the service was nice bud got sick from the food."
lovely restaurant peaceful setting and best ‘pannekoeken’ in the world. i chose the teriyaki one with beef with a nice glass of red wine and a small bottle of rivella. y 
we went in for a quick bite to eat. the exterior looked cozy and christmassy. inside you feel at home with the wooden furniture and warm lights. the staff is friendly and quick to help y 
"the strandpavilioen luctor et emergo is situated in a perfect location on the dunes of camperduin. great view, efficient system of ordering and paying (you order at the bar and get a numbered token). clean and modern; newspapers of the day available; we ordered a pea soup (erwtesoep met speck) and alas it was not up to dutch standards... maybe we simply have not been lucky"
"fletcher hotels offer a 29,50€ 3 course menu, with some classic courses like tomato soup, fish and chips, mixed grill, coffee with sweets. several guests were complaining about the meat: hard and dry like the proverbial old shoe. the fish also wasnt to the mark, a large thick crust on top of a messy conglomerate of hake. some of the desert seemed stale, leftover. the best part all in all was the simple soup. we regularly stay in fletcher hotels and often eat there. they dont offer top gourmet, but mostly we had no complaints. this was substandard."
"the hotel and the service was good, but the rooms some us 15 people got was small. nice staff and good food in the restaurant. the breakfast was okay too!"
had lunch her and the food was nothing special. i had the open face ham & cheese which could have had some more ham. my wife had a chicken dish which she said was just fine.
they can’t seem to deliver the food all together - why is it ok for half the table to eat and the other to watch - slow service - and a stinky smelly terrace allowing people to smoke which came inside the restaurant and stank - not worth a visit.
"after recommendations of friends, we decided to have dinner at wonders. unfortunately we were very disappointed as we had to wait for a very long time for our main course (but it was busy so we didnt complain). when main course finally arrived, we were told our kids were too noisy (they obviously had waited a very long time for their food to arrive). clearly, not a child friendly place (despite having a child menu so one would think otherwise). would not recommend going here with kids. very disappointing."
"had dinner here a few nights ago and was very disappointed. two of us ordered the peking duck salad which was a plate of soggy salad, even though we had asked for no dressing and 3 minuscule pieces of duck which you needed a magnifying glass to see. i complained to the waiter who said he would tell the chef. we of course never heard any answer or apology. the portions are very small here and i am not a big eater. definitely not worth the money!"
"the food was bad and the service terrible. they forgot almost everything. there were also things on our bill that we didnt have, and they said we did have them"
"we arrived quite late, the place was packed, i think there was not enough waiters, it was a total disaster. they were not nice, we had to wait hours for a soup for the kids and when i asked if we could have the soup at least for the kids cos it was late, she turned round saying yes it will come when it is your turn.. then when it actually came to the table, the soup was boiling! when our food finally was served, it was ok but not great and very expensive for what it was."
very negative!!! no menu in english. very bad attitudine of waiters. you don’t get what you order. very expensive. i strongly reccomend not to eat in this place.
"very nice place with good food. we were there with friends, about 15 people. the service was a bit slow and very inelegant in serving the wine..."
"we were on a 1-day-visit in bergen. i checked the trip-advisor-reviews before we chose a restaurant, so we decided to eat at fabels. at first sight we liked the charming and welcoming decor but unfortunately this was the only thing that was charming and welcoming in this restaurant. although we were asked quite quickly to order a drink, we had to wait an eternity before one of the waitresses (4 of them standing at the bar, chatting...) reacted to our waving, because we had to make a hand-sign before anyone would come to ask what we would like to eat. we almost asked ourselves if we had put on frodos ring, because we felt completely invisible. whereas the other guests (who spoke dutch) were treated kindly, we felt like undesirable strangers. the boss passed several times at our table, he didnt say hello, didnt ask if everything was okay, he ignored us, but he was friendly with the dutch-speaking guests. the food eventually arrived, it was okay, but not fantastic. we left as soon as we could because we really didnt feel at ease. far away from the cosy atmosphere that was described in some reviews. unlike our usual habit, we didnt leave a tip, because we really disliked the unfriendly and cold service. we wont go back to this place and we dont recommend it to non-dutch-speaking people. "
"we were there pretty early, but is was quite busy already. the tables for two were very close together. food is not too fancy, but good."
"crowded place indicating that the food is good. stay away from the nacho todos, but the spare ribs were good. so was the parma ham, soft and tasty. dogs are allowed inside and is not a good combination when it rains outside. smell wet dog."
"the place is nicely located - centrally in bergen ... it is indeed quite an intimate setting and one feels relax and at ease. the service was really good and quite attentive - job well done. the only reason we rate the restaurant as average, is as a consequence of the food. the appetizers were just ok but the main course was not meeting expectations ... some of the dishes had been too long in the oven or warmer and resulting in dry food ... not succulent. the burgers are great, but without any greens on the side it was a bit naked ... one small pack of fries to share with two is equally astonishing ... i wonder how that small pack of fries would have looked if there was only one of us to order the burger :) ! the bar and standard is quite high with us ... weve done a good number of places and this was not what we had expected. we will not come back even though we live close by."
nice menu but food quality is very poor. friendly staff.
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 € for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service ! "
we visited (couple) during the week for a late lunch - it was not extremely crowd 
"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didn’t get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you can’t book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz 
food is ok service slow but worse thing is people bringing thier dogs in .animals eat outside when we asked to move was a major problem
"tasty pancakes and waffles.  however i do not recommend waffles with ice cream and fruits.   coffee was ok, but not the best ever ;)"
"heart warming for parents and exciting for kids - here you get reasonably priced, easy to sell to kids type of food - pizza, pancakes, lasagne! : "
"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"
"tried soup of the day, 2 schnitzel, french fries and apple compote at the restaurant. reasonable good. good and friendly service."
noisy and not so good service. the food was okay! maybe a little bit early in the season for the staff
"this is a large, popular place in a nice location, though very noisy. nice atmosphere otherwise though. service was unreasonably slow and rather confused. dishes are served with chips and salad but these are charged separately and need to be ordered. quite pricey when this is considered"
the place was packed when we arrived and although we had made a reservation for 20:00 we were made to wait for a further 15 minutes until our table became availabl 
large centrally located restaurant in bergen. the atmosphere is somewhat in distinctive and bland. probably your best option for lunch in bergen however.
"we made a reservation for 9 people and were well received. the service was ok, but when we asked if we could order extra vegetables (they only had onions, mushrooms and salad available) the waitress could not help us. turns out everything is pre-prepared and ordered, so they simply dont have separate vegetables to grill. this was a problem because some of us have allergies. the steaks were very well cooked and tasty, but finding out theyre cooked in blue band (margarine) instead of butter (like they say) was another disappointme "

"loetje is a restaurant chain, known for their steaks. my wife doesnt like meat, but she had a great steak at loetje near amsterdam. so, we went to bergen for the best steak ever. but i expected too much. the steaks was overcooked and cold. all the sides dishes were col "
"last saturday we had dinner at loetje in bergen. the weather was nice, so we requested for a table on the large outside terrace. there was some confusion and it took a while before the staff served us. we all ordered the famous steak, but when the plates came, one plate was missing. the waiter apologized and solved the problem as soon as possible. the steaks were nice, but not as great as we are used to at loetje. it is not yet the oiled machine like loetje aan t ij in the north of amsterdam, but it is still a young branch and they have time to improve."
decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
we went here for a beer and some foo 
"the service was nice, however nobody else except from us was in the restaurant. when asking whether the “schnitzel” was fresh, the service lady went back to the kitchen to ask and answered that it’s pork when she returned. a deep fried piece was served, dry and definately not fresh. we received one portion of fries where me and my partner should have received our own portion per person as this is what we where paying for. 16 euro for a deep fried single piece of (not even) meat is a joke. we’ve paid 40 euro for a portion of kibbeling and a schnitzel, a small coke and a glass of win "
"went here with mr. husband and little one. we were early, servers were still haring diner themselves in the dining area (don’t like that "
"from the outside it was already unclear. is it a restaurant or a snackbar. from the menu i would say it is more a snackbar. so i had a bit of difficulty to find a nice lunch.. still a very friendly, easy accessible place to eat and the new owners were doing their best to give good service."
"visited the restaurant on a sunday morning for a cup of coffee. i couldnt find a registration form at the entrance of the restaurant. after i ordered coffee at the collection desk, i was rudely asked if i had already completed a form. when i answered negatively, a form and pen were thrown at me. we finished our coffee and enjoyed the view."
"fastfood-style self service restaurant. a bit pricy, but food was okay. nice views from the deck. nothing fancy, but if you just want to eat, you can go here."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection. "
i found place itself somehow wear 
"it,s such a shame..we went to this part of groningen because there was an article in the volkskrant...one of the best fish restaurants in the netherlands.it was not worth the tr "
"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
"this was a nice enough cafe, although a bit too much like a school cafeteria. the ice cream across the road was great."
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldn’t really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"service was nice. food was good. menu looked quite balanced , better then earlier times we visited. having ostrich in hoogerheide who would have guessed?? portions nice. ambience little confusing but overall not a bad place to visit. if you stick to just a main course or the daily special moneywise doable . they even have special entrees easy to share! do not expect high cuisine , you will have a nice evening!"
"we got a feeling that our waiter forgot about us initially. at first before our order was taken, and then later on, after we finished our starter, the same thing happened. the restaurant was pretty full, but you would expect that the staffing is geared to deal with that. after we reminded the staff about the main course, it took another 30 mins. we had a good time nevertheless, but to really judge this restaurant it deserves another visit. the food was tasty, so i would recommend trying it."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happened…. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside… even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"i went there recently with family for what was meant to be a nice evening out however, i when i left i was not one bit happy or satisfied. i am not saying that this is a totally bad place. actually it is perfect if you want to go with children. it has a nice big play area for the children. the staff are very attentive and friendly. they talk with a smile and are polite. the menu is reasonable with a reasonable pric "
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.🐶 it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."
we went there several times.the menu is typical dutch.food is fine but the  service is very slow. their crème caramel is really good
"fish is fresh! that is good! waiters take their time and if you go during lunch time make sure your have several hours. it takes time at this place. the baked cod, gebakken vis, has a different coating than traditional... you must like  "
"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"new owner and style restaurant which we must try, a birthday was the right occasion i would say. we entered via the side entrance and started with a drink outside. that went ok, we had one menu and ordered from that menu… bit strange we did not get more menus but i thought they assumed we were going inside to order (as we said we wanted to dine inside). anyway, there were plenty of girls serving but they just did their thing and did not look around it was sometimes hard to get their attention. some were ok in the service but one was a bit clumsy. anyway, starters were about to be served so we went inside (still having a very nice look over the water-edge though). starters were a shared vegetarian bruschetta, shared meat-platter, paprika soup (soup of the day) and croquettes. portion size was quite good, the soup even came with two thick slices of bread. they kindly asked if the main could be served and those came all within a minute or 3-4 (not direct) accompanied with a huge portion of fries. we ordered 2x the spare ribs (very tasty and good), chicken satay with fries and fried rice on the plate (huge salad also), salmon with bearnaise sauce, sea-bass filets and tender pork fillets. the dishes were very well made up and portion size was more than adequate. after finishing the mains we ordered desserts, coconut with pineapple (it was some kind of coconut whip cream look, tasted great), chocolate cake brownie with white chocolate ice-cream, sorbet and 2x yoghurt with crumble and fruit. mainly the yoghurt with fruit was overpriced i would say. actually all the desserts but not to bad all in all. we had a good evening the bill did not break the bank and the food itself is really good quality, but the service was below par, in particular to the food quality. i do think the boss is in the kitchen and he needs some senior girs/guys to overlook the servers. than it would be the best food in the best place with great service, now we end with just not that. keep up the good work and youll get there chef!"
had a quick bite to eat at the restaura 
"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."
"ordered a tosti (bread with grilled cheese), but received one with ham. small accident, no problem, but we dont eat pork. mentioned this to the waitress, but was called a liar. they wouldnt replace the order.   great location, terrible service, would not recommend visiting."
"food was average, staff friendly, kitchen with low capacity & staff decided to serve two couples coming in later first such that we had to wait for little bit less than 1 hr for our lunch. by that time the couples already paid the check. only a sorry, not a normal gesture e.g. like offering the drinks for free. not coming back."
"... but still not the high quality that i am looking for in schouwen-duivenland. friendly waiters, good location, will be good in summer."
"too expensive, sharing one little salat and one little bowl of patatoes for 6 people eating spare ribbs at 16 €/person and nobody (not even the kids eaten an adult portion) felt ok with this plate, some spare ribs were half burned and the stuff seemed to avoid us as we got no bread and butter as others and drinks took a long time too. a little beer for 2,20 € is kind of ok if the service is good. but this place seemed to have enough business now with holland people so that they can treat german tourists as bad as  "
"the food isn’t half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didn’t eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth €15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now i’m sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks it’s ok to throw away €15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we don’t waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely what’s going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didn’t understand you. and i firmly asked what she didn’t understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i don’t need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way i’m waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw €10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."
"arrived at apartment 24 to find a dirty smelly apartment with dog hair everywhere, on the pillows , floor and curtains, stains on the mattress ,the floor was dirty too , ornaments had a deep layer of dust with dog hair in it too it was simply disgusting,the whole apartment needed a deep clean , you could tell that it just gets a cursory quick clean for a quick turnaround but this isn’t good enough goodness knows what cleaners they’re hirin "
named after a historic local poet the restaurant is affectionately decorated with antiques. dishes are on average both with quality and prices.

"we came there to try mussels menu advertised on the website of the restaurant. however it wasnt available. we ended up with gratin mussels as a starter which were good. the main dishes however were just ok, without any plus or minus. average salmon and pasta. i was very surprised to see in my pasta with gambas lots of bacon. good im not a vegetarian i though "
"sadly la plaisanterie was the only place we found open for coffee, in this pretty harbour square with its lovely, seasonally-decorated hous "
we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.
had a quick lunch here out on the terrace. salad was good and tasty with some fresh bread. service friendly enjoyable place to sit in the sun for lunch.
"everything is average. the coffee, the chocolate, the apple pie was a nice try. but overall in this ambiance and atmosphere is it really nice to be here. i think they have enough customers around so they dont have to perform at their highest leve "
food can be ordered (fastfood) by using the provided landal app. predicted pickup time however is totally inaccurate. in my specific case more than 35! minutes of
"we went there on a saturday evening to have a small dinner. the restaurant appears to be a snack bar with some tables. we ordered steaks, which were very very tough and way overcooked. the spaghetti carbonara was uneatable salty. the sharma was to salty and too much."
"the food was good, the staff was on and off in their friendliness. we went here twice in august. on monday evening the staff was friendly and quick to help us. on tuesday afternoon, they never seemed to notice my husband. he was in a wheelchair and couldnt just walk to the bar to order a drink. afterwards we found out that they were just with the 2 of them for the whole terrace. that was clearly not enough for a hot day in the high season. a lot of people choose to sit themselves on the terrace after swimming in the pool. the swimming pool was fun, it was busy, but that was to be expected on a heatwave day. "
"had dinner with friends there very recently. lovely ambience, a very comprehensive and original menu. the food was well presented and more than deliciou "
had a late afternoon ice cream and one time dinner. we like the interior and the terrace outside. also there is a small playground for childr 
"the restaurant is absolutely beautiful, very cosy and comfi sitting, loads of choice in pancakes and cakes (what we went for) a nice outdoor terrace. i found the service to be quite slow and not really synchronised in between the team. the food was good and well served. its not french crepe, its a dutch style crepe (deep pan and butter butter butt "
we ordered pancakes and uitsmijters. they were okay. the coffeemachine didnt work so i got tea but also a free coffee. they really did their best to find a way to serve coffee. so the people are sweet but they charge a bit too much...
"we had a ham and cheese pancake in this small restaurant. the pancakes are ok, about the same in quality ase anywhere else in the netherland "
"when going to the rien portvliet museum, the option for a late lunch my husband and i found in the island where the museum is located, was this pancake house. it seems that there are some other restaurants, but not close to the muse "

"went in for a quick bite during lunch time. friendly face service, accomodating to vegetarian request. glass of fresh orange juice (delicious) and a sandwich-bun with mozzarella, tomato, pesto(tasty and filling). together 10 euros."
"was a little less than expected, for the price, it is ok. i had a starter that was good, scampi, the main dish was trout and this was also good. the down side was the frys were only warm, the salad was very standard and the vegetables were overcook "
wow i can’t believe the service over there. we where with a group of 8 people. the food was cold!!! after we went to the club and they couldn’t find or reservation. jose and one girl came with the bottle’s with a bad attitude .. after all bad service never never again!!!!!!!!!!! rude employee’s
"this place has a really nice terrace next to the roundabout. we had coffee and vlaai here. what bothered me is the standard choices of vlaai, it seems no one in this part of the country haves an incliment to differentiate from the rest. its all the same everywher "
"ate here with friends during a cycling trip last weekend: the service is very good and the interior is great as well. the food looked amazing, but the taste was not really good: my fish soup was very salty and i presume my stomach cramps were due to this soup ;( my friends hamburger was also not very good, the price was around 10eur, but he received cheap chicken-nugget like patties on a bun. our other friend had no complaints with his hearty pancake."
"not good at all, but it’s a camping “snack bar” — so only use this if there are not other possibiliti "
"the paal6 has a lovely location right by the sea and is beautifully decorated. also the food is very nice, with some lovely choices and they are well prepared for kids too. unfortunately the staff, with some exceptions who were very nice, is quite unfriendly and inattentive. i think this is a shame, because if it weren’t for this, the place would have received 5 points from me."
22.5 € for a 150gr. fish is to much and the one gamba and four crispy cute chips was very funny sorry but that was a disaster dinner
we stopped here in the hope for a late lunch / early dinner but were informed no food could be ordered at that time - it was approx. 4pm. naturally we were disappointed and hungry! we did however stay for drink 
"went there for diner with family, food was ok but overpriced. you have to pay for the view, close to the beach. before 20:00 very noisy due to kids. service rather lame and not paying attention. dogs allowed. not recommended...."
"the paal 6 is a bar/restaurant on poles on a beautiful, seemingly endless beach in noord holland. it is one of the few beachside places to remain open during winter, but the surroundings are also very busy during summer. so if calm and serenity are your thing, maybe look a few hundred meters to the left/right: the beach is huge, and most people stay very close to the restaurant( "
"we recently visited the coast of north holland and after a lovely walk through the dunes and along the shore we decided to stop for some lunch. this restaurant is up on poles, nestled against the dunes, and has a beautiful view of the ocean. after a walk along the beach in december its nice and warm inside. on the afternoon we were there it was quiet on the beach and in the restaurant. the menu is typical dutch fare, paninis, some sandwiches etc. prices are high compared to other restaurants. the service was slow and surly. the food we ordered was fair to go "
monopoly? not used to public? not flexible enough to adapt to good weather? anyhow: more than 1 hour waiting for very regular food is really too much.  improve your communication skills please..... always the same when you place your order with electronic devices....
"my family has visited julianadorp almost every year since the early 70ies, and i myself have been there almost every summer for 25 years. as long as i can think, there used to be a really nice, cozy and somewhat retro restaurant at the strandslag de zandloper: the schip of tstrand, gaining its name from an old, stranded ship which had been converted into a restaurant some decades ago, later replaced with a more pragmatic, seamans style shack on wooden pol "
the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasn’t bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."
this place was not good at all. starter ( calamari) and kids’ pasta were way too simple and nothing special abou 
"i ordere tom yum prawns. it arived in a bowl drenched in half a cup of oil with no chilli, coriander, lime, garlic or ginger in site. when i brought it under the attention of the owner she rudely informed me that this is their way of cooking tom yum. i did not eat it but was billed €13 for it. restauranteurs like this are tipping their customers off ....but at their own detriment. they might cash in on us once but times are tough and and ignorant attitude like this will count against them on the long ru "
"we were there on our 1st eve. the place was not particularly clean (sticky table & papers on the floor). the meat-burger was ok, but the fish-burger was a fried thin patty taken out of the freezer - or at least it looked and tasted like it. no, nothing fancy about this place."
"food quality was poor. rice with the pokébowl was served as one big sticky bal. after feedback to the kitchen no excuse, nor any compensation was offered."
went here for a saturday evening dinner. it is located near a holiday park and therefore lot of people from that park were dining there with children. as the (nicely looking) interior is made of lots of metal and other hard surfaces it is quite noisy. the interior itself is industrial style and very nice looki 
"the restaurant is part of a big holiday resort. place is clean and looks quite nice. staff is very friendly. food is ok, but could be better. the choice of dishes is interesting, also trying to serve asian dishes and other out of the box stuff might be a bridge too far."
"came to this store to try the pizza take away service as our dog was not allowed into the restaurant. friendly reception and ample parking. pizza however was a real let down. pizza dough tasted like cardboard and quickly heated, toppings were ok. if you enjoy pizza go elsewhere or buy a frozen one in the supermarket. poor value for money. do not recommend! "
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really don’t understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
food was terribly overcookes and the selection was minimal. terribly below the standard of what you would expect if you spend almost 30 euros per adult.
we are here in the evening. the restaurant is just too expensive for what they serve on the buffet. it is not worth it.
"it looks like an amazing place with a wooden cosy house and a terrace above the sea next to the harbour, amazing food too. but then you find out that the owners are the most unpolite people you can find. we tried to order a beer and to enquire about the food but weve just been turned out by a guy yelling at us as soon as he discovered that we didnt understand what he was saying. the gesture was pretty clear though... very unpleasant and it ruins all the charm of the place."
"we visited bistro skal several times during a stay at the dutch coast. while the service was never particularly attentive and we ended up with half an avocado as a replacement for a falafel (!?), the service on the last day was one of the worst i have experienced. we dropped in for a late lunch at 3.30. there were seven of us, five adults and two children. the waitress was reluctant to give us a table as she needed it back at 5pm. anyway she agreed to take a quick order and we ordered drinks. when it came to ordering food, she flatly refused to serve a single portion of chips for one of the children. her argument was that she couldn’t profitably run a restaurant if guest just ordered chips. when we pointed out that we were also ordering six further meals she seemed initially more flexible, but the shutters went down when it turned out that one of the adult diners wanted fish & chips. that meal was only available in child size and there was apparently no option to adjust to adult size. we decided to get a takeaway from the place next door and while we ate outside in the sun, the table we originally sat at was empty… a shame as the ambience is very nice and it could be a great place to eat with children."
"there is an information button for each menu. but only half of the dishes actually have something about allergens. so i ordered a salad (which was on the menu twice, with two different prices). when i got the salad, it had different nuts in it. i asked the waiter to bring me a new salad, as i have an extreme nut allergy. after a short while, a waitress came and told us in an impossible tone that i had to ask if there were nuts in a dish. they would also charge me for the old salad and half price for the new one. there was no information about the contents of the salad via the info button and waiters could not be beckoned to the table either, as this was always ignored (we had tried to order drinks beforehand). in the eu, every restaurant and every snack bar is obliged to point out the major allergens. this includes nuts in particular! this information was not taken into account her "
never order any seafood her 
"we went for a long walk on the beach and decided to have a hot chocolate and maybe something to eat. the restaurant is outdated and furnished with cheap tables and seating and lacks warmth and atmosphere. a waiter came to our table and said drinks? no hello, no how are you? prices are high so we were thinking of leaving as we saw staff just wandering by, not really helping clients. but there was one, shall we say voluptuous lady, that did come to our table, said hello with a smile and started chatting so we decided to stay. unfortunately, the hot chocolate that we ordered had been on the stove too long so it was burnt but the kind lady immediately replaced it without questions being asked. we had some snacks as well (tosti, soup, sausage roll) and these were ok but we noted that the kind lady who served us was the only one doing her job. the rest just lingered near the kitchen. message to the owner: train your personel in hospitality and service (except the one lady mentioned)."
"went here for dinner, portions are generous and prices decent, not cheap but not overly expensive. also the quality of the food is quite good! we really enjoyed the dishes, made perfectly, portion sizes good and taste was perfec "
"wanted to have some nice drink and read a book. they had no coctails on the menu, so i ordered gin & tonic. they brought me the tiniest glass possible, i was able to pour not even a third of the tonic in it, so it tasted like pure gin. i had to ask for a bigger glass because it was undrinkable. they added the squeezing lemon thingy stick in the drink, but the lemon was stuck on it from the other side... so even though the squeezing stick is in your drink, forget about squeezing your lemon in the drink. nobody speaks english.."
"i visit ouddorp a few times a year, when the sun shines and ive been to c-side before for drinks. this time, however, i went for diner. i ordered a cheeseburger and the burger was horrible. it was obviously one of those packeged, frozen burgers,which can be ok. but it was nasty of flavour, with just a little melted cheese on a sloppy bun. there was a little slaw and a slice of tomato next to it, but not enough to hide the bad flavour. no sauce, no vegetables on the burger. i was shocked by the standard. i ate half of the burger because i was hungry but i did tell the staff my complaints about the burger and how i was unsatisfied. i asked to only pay for half the burger, because that was how much i ate, but the staff would not do so. the burger was €4,50, so were talking about €2,25, the price of a drink. she could have giving me a free drink, as a symbol. you want your customers to be happy and satisfied, right? when i told her that me and my friends (5 of us) would never come back, she did not seem to care one bit. which is her right, but having worked in restaurants myself, this kind of service is below standard and pretty shameful i think. the rest of the staff was quite friendly and they lost a big tip on this kind of behaviour. i hope the owner reads this, because he/she just lost a few €100 and a regular clientele over €2,25. not to mention the bad reviews well be giving. were taking our money to another beach bar."
"had lunch here last weekend. it was a lovely day, not too hot and behind the glass screens it was lovely to sit outside with views of the sea. we ordered large cappuccinos but were given normal sizes. they handled it well though and gave us a second cappuccino each. the sizes of the meals were huge. prices were good for the amount you get. dont expect anything fancy, but if you are looking for a nice meal on a beautiful beach, this is a good place to go. parking is close, as is a playground for the children. "
"sunny day.  weating time 1 hour for drinks en 1,5 hour for food. bad service people where leaving.  dont go here if you want to have a good time at the sea."
i can’t really say much about the restaurant or food as we waited for 25 minutes for a menu which never arrived & gave up! we asked two separate people & not one of them returned! so we left & went to zee down the road where we had a delicious meal & great service.
"beautiful seaside location. beach house atmosphere. slow and disorganised service, forgetting and mixing up orders. some members of the staff are rude, ( to be fair, many other are polite ). diverse quality of meals served"
"slow and unfriendly staff, takes too much time to clean the tables and food was okay. sorry, but no 1? we defenitely expected more..."
i was in the natural high for two times. once i was nearly not serviced and had to wait quite a while although it was not even half full. another time i got reseat 
we were there with the 6 of us. we ordered careys (some chicken and some gambas). tast was ok but ingredients were very poor.
"the food has no taste there (at least what we have eaten), but its very expensive.  unfortunately, our kids were foodpoisoned in our last day of holiday."
"setting great overlooking beach , food average ,,slightly short but vert friendly staff  good for lunch with surf shop next door , supper slightly disappointing with limited menu however still a,fun place to be"
"popped in here for a drink whilst our teens did the beach kite buggies. the coffee was very nice and staff attentive and friendly. the decor is really cool and of course views of the ocean were great. the food smelled nice (deep fried) but looked quite sad even though the menu was quite varied. we didnt eat here as it didnt look appetising. also, unfortunately the toilets stank. i could smell them before i opened the door.

"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to €10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend €50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste.

"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5€ (the wine only cost 10€). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"unfriendly service team, especially in you are not a native speaker. actually it was our second try there. but:  never again!"
"we know this place many years. in these days of our vacation we went there two times. the place has been renovated, which is looking very goo "
food was okay but really nothing special. we had a burger and some other stuff you have on the beach. was there for dinner on a weekday and didnt needed a reservation. not like at the sister location bijmarc the service was friendly and attentive. its a good choice if you are in the area and want dinner with a view to the sea.
basic bar food. good fries. funny tasting sauce with fish and chips and the sole. fresh salad. generally large portions.
"following many reviews we visited this store for dinner twice and were not really excited. this place is popular due to its excellent location on the beach. on weekends it is packed, many tables reserved and little or no choice of outside seating. during peak hours one feels the kitchens struggles to keep up the quality. had the impression food was prepared hours in advance and had been sitting a while. choice of menu good. great place for drinks and snacks. service friendly and helpful. great for a pit stop, less so for dinner. "
"called for a drink - took ages for staff to come and clear the table we sat at. the waiter then didnt really wipe the tables, just dusted everything on to the floor so you were stood in the previous occupants food remains. ordered a beer and prosecco- the prosecco was flat with no bubbles as it should have. when trying to pay no one came near us and in the end we had to go find someone to pay our money too."
"nice location with great and spacious terrace on beautiful beach however, food is just ok. service is incredibly slow and not motivated at all. smiling is not a common attitude here. upper notch price with low range service on a great location with many opportunities to improve. "
"even though the front side of the menu says ask our staff about alergens, the waiter had no idea what i mean when i asked if its possible to get a glutenfree bread. i asked also in dutch, he still didnt know. nevermind, imma have a salad. the salad was unfortunately drenched in oil, a green oily puddle was forming at the bottom of the bowl, large as soup. they have literally 3 drinks on the menu, managed to bring me the one i did not order."
"the interior looks nice. the view is nice as well. even though there were only 20 guests, it took the staff (4 people) 15 minutes to take our order. the food was mediocre and the prices were not. staff not helpfull, grumpy."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldn’t go there again. "
"food and service where really not great. blonde girl in service was really rude, she didnt even bother to explain the menu."
"very nice menus, but classical, nothing very innovative, special seervice in restaurant was very good indeed"
"had a fletcher burger in the hotels restaurant and found a piece of hard, sharp plastic in my food. the incident kind of ruined my stay in this otherwise nice hotel. will definitely not come here to eat."
"we arrived happily and went to the beach, we had booked a table at the restaurant for 7pm with our two childre "
"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
a nice place for a drink! but we received far from fresh seafood.. staff is friendly but the kitchen could be much better.
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the portions are very small. i ordered a vegetable dish that was very disappointing you could hardly see vegetables. everything is fluffy, none substance."
"we went there last night for my 61st birthday after reading the good reviews on this site. we booked for and arrived at 1900. by 2100 we had shared 2 very small portions (like 3 bites per person) and one bread roll. the food was interesting, but perhaps the two courses we ate were trying to be interesting rather than necessarily delicious. after searching the floor to finally find one of the two waitpersons, i told him we had eaten 2 very small dishes in 2 hours and it was too slow. he did not respond as far as i could see. we waited another 10 minutes, and then got up to go, just as our fish main course was coming out of the kitchen. at that (late) moment, the waiter offered us the meal without charge and tried to make amends, saying it was a new menu this week and therefore slow. but we were fed up (or not !) and did not feel like staying after thi "
"the place its self looks okay... but the staff behind the bar is terrible. they forget drinks a lot of times, promise to make them in 5 minutes and 15 minutes later you still dont have a drink... and when you go back they tell you they forget about it... again. and when they finally bring your drink its the wrong drink. if this would happen once i wouldnt mind... but this happend serval times. the bouncers are absolutely amazing and very helpful."
"we came here for dinner. it was ok. the service was friendly but very slow. i had the carpaccio burger and my husband had the xxl cheese burger. both burgers were ok. flavor was there but the sides fell short. the sides were fries and coleslaw they just seemed like an after thought. they aren’t very small child friendly but it was one of the only options to eat at when we got here. there is no changing table so if you have a child in diapers you will have to change them on the floor. we were seated outside which you are allowed to smoke outside so we were seated by a bunch of smokers. we wanted to be inside but i’m not sure why that wasn’t an option because we didn’t want to be by smokers while we ate. it’s a good atmosphere if you are single, married, or have older kids. seemed a little expensive for what we got. i wouldn’t come here agai "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
too bad these people serve fresh mint tea with lice twice in a row and debate that this is normal. giving us the feeling that we are very silly in our complaint.
"very poor service, long waitingtimes. enough people to serve but not easy to make contact with them. pasta truffel tasteless. icecoffee with no icecream allthough this was mentioned on the menu. they brought a new one. nice terrace."
"today, me and my boyfriend went out to get those famous b&j strawberries. we ordered 2 milkshakes and some separate strawberries. unfortunately, 6 people that were behind us in the queue were helped earlier, and when we finally received our ‘milkshakes’, they appeared to be smoothies... we asked the coworker about this and she very convincedly told us these were the milkshakes... the people before us ordered milkshakes as well and those looked conpletely different, much lighter, because there was milk in there... the smoothies were way too sugerary and we threw them away at the fitst trashcan we saw... this was our first and last experience with the b&j strawberries... also, the products are very overpriced..."
"terrible service. expensive subs, very long wait, toasted sandwiches are cold and not what we ordered. bad quality."
"don’t let the menu fool you... i’m from texas and know real quality. i obviously don’t expect it to be perfect here, but i do expect it to be close... and this wasn’t even clo "
"men and my boyfriend visited this restaurant do some lunch. the lunch menu seemed very big with nice choices so we were impressed. we both order the tacos. we waited a long time for them. when they arrived they were awful. they were not tacos. they were tiny wraps, with a small.cold amount of beef, tiny veggies and a dollop of sauce. 2 bites and one was gome. for 5.50 euro it was an absolute rip off. cold and tiny food. we paid and then went and got some spring rolls from a different place. we would never go back to this restaurant"
"the steak was cooked to perfection and was very tasty , but serving a steak with crisps !!! really ... very disappointing"
"for the price you are paying for this meat you would expect they would know how to season the meat with salt, they do not. the best thing on my plate was the garlic butter. the menu is only in dutch which i can kind of understand expect the other restaurants around them have english menus as well as dutch. my husband and i both got the sirloin and the temperatures were right for most of the steak. my husbands was a little under cooked towards the outside. the side they give you to go with a steak is lays potato chips....and you don’t get that many. potato chips and steak is not what i would say is a good combo. they give you bread before the meal with what tastes like ranch dressing instead of butter. i think a good steak does not need salt or a1 sauce and this steak needed both. very disappointed. do not recommend. "
"meet is usually good. it is always served with the same sauces, same butter, same crispies, same chips and same bread! this is so boring. there are definitely ways to improve."
"first i asked for a soup and it was water with a few vegetables in it, there was no salt or pepper so i had to ask a few times before it was given, the pepper was empty and we had to wait another 10 minutes before the waitress came rushing around to other tables to get her attention, the lamb at first had a good flavor with the dipping sauce which saved it, i asked for well cooked and as usual the dutch refuse to listen to customers and it was nearly raw inside, my husband got a mixed grill with all kinds of sauces poured over everything masking the chicken which was pink inside and one of the meats tasted strange like a liver flavor when you got through all the weird sauces they poured onto it, i had to spit it out and asked the waitress what kind of meat i was eating. i had to laugh while at the table because all the locals had body language as if they were eating at some fancy establishment, the soup also had a ring around the top, and i was scared the food hadnt been clean like our table. i had to ask many times for a napkin and when i gave the waitress at the end 50 euros of a 44 euro bill she came back with 2 euro 50 wondering where was the rest of the 6 euros. then i had to ask her 3 times to give me the correct change. overall it was truly a reflection of how incredibly awful the restaurants in holland are and how the locals eat it like its dog food and enjoy it. i was so sick to my stomach after we left too. gross!!!"
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin café. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "
"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the saté, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."
i have been here 2 times already. mostly very bus 
"called in for a quick lunch. food was good and service friendly. looks like the locals frequent, so that is recommendation in itself."
year after year the same menu. french fries could be better. service is very variable with ups and downs prices are above average.
"weve asked to get a table with a dog and have been told the kitchen is closed , while other guests still came i "
this restaurant is unusually located in a former train station building next to the disused railway line (now a cycle path) which operated between turnhout and tilburg. the restaurant has been nicely renovated and now has quite a modern interior with plenty of space and comfortable seati 
"the other reviews suggested this would be a great restaurant in the vicinity but in our experience it was really not that great. the price shouldve warned me; 3 courses for 24,95 is a great deal; too good to be true. however i didnt realize this is the only dinner option they offered, so i share it here. let me start by staying the restaurant looks nice, the beers are great and the staff is very friendly. coming to the food however; the mozzarella at the caprese starter wasnt very tasty (and thats the main ingredient), the veggies and black angus steak tasted somewhat burned (even though it wasnt visibly burned) and the creme brulé was soft and mushy. for the price, it was ok, but with 4.5 stars on tripadvisor and compared to our dinner the evening before at den engel this one left is disappointed."
"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit ‘too much’. pick one of the more ‘traditional’ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"friendly service, but otherwise absolute rubbish. the food was poor and we waited 2 hours from starter to main course!"
"this establishment survives by location alone. beautiful views but the food is awful, hygiene poor (bar area, kitchen viewed from bar area and toilet facilities) and attitude of servers verging on rude. go for a drink maybe but don’t be ripped off by the price for rubbish food"
"we have often stopped here for a coffee or beer as the location is beautiful. the food menu is basic but if you are just looking for that then it is fine. what i was really surprised by was that the toilet facilities now cost 1 euro, even for guests of the cafe & then to add insult to injury there was no toilet paper & the area needed a good clean. this is totally unacceptable during the coronavirus crisis, everyone should have access to hand washing facilities...there wasnt even sanitising hand gel available at the entrance. this cafe did not fulfil the requirements set out by the dutch government for health at this time."
absolutely disappointing. beautiful location but poor quality food at a price for which you would expect high quality. clients need to pay for washing their hands which is unacceptable in the current situation of the corona virus. pass your way and pick up any other beach restaurant in renesse. 
"visited a gen ing last sunday when we took a break from mountain-biking. we just had some coffees and a tea and ice creams, nothing special to mention. tea and coffee were alright, we were served quickly and had a nice rest on the terra "
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"the location is nice and the menu looks good. however, the taste is a bit bland and uninspiring. we had a fine main course but especially the starter and dessert we just less then we expected for the price we paid. the staff is very kind and pleasant. the good service compensates the food which is why we give it 3 stars. "
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
terrible food and it took 1.5h to get the burgers. location is ok but also the stuff is not able to do their job.  never ever a next visit.
we visited teetied on a cycling tour. it has a nice terrace at the waterfront. so we stopped to have some drinks and a small lunch. the lunch chart is a bit limited but the view and location is very nice. we had some tostis and some drinks en enjoyed our stay. perfect place for a short stop-over. i would not recommend this if you want to have a extended meal or lunch.
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"i made a reservation through airbnb worth €906 (1 to 30 of april), i received the booking confirmation and two days later (4 days before my flight) the host canceled the reservation. i sent a message begging him, for not to stay on the street sleeping and the host didnt want to know. and my refund money only after 15 days. beware of bookings on this place !!"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"stopped here for drinks. nice location on the river vecht  looking at the lunch dishes it seemed a bit overpriced, lots of bread. well guess you pay for the location as well, nigtevecht is a nice place"
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"service was a little slow, but staff was friendly. prices are decent and the food is of decent to good quality."
had a quick dinner here during our boadtri 
"the ice cream is very good, however my son chose the licorice  flavor and ended up with gastro was definitely from there, so not very hygienic"
"arrived at 17:40, requested 2 for dinner. male manager looked at clock and said ok, we can try. while every other guest was on patio or at windows, we were the only pair put back in the dark, stuffy bar. when the server arrived with no menus, we stared at each other - we had to ask for menus. we put our order in quickly. as we ate, other orders came out with no issue. the kitchen was not closed. food was ok, not worth seating drama."
"grand cafe valerius sounds promising, but in the end we were not really pleased. service was very much depending on the waiter/waitress and the food just wasnt it. the asparagus with ham was much to salty as was the asparagus soup we had as an entree. and the main dish with risotto was to much we could bear: first cooked, then fried. our stomachs couldnt handle it and we didnt eat or drink for the rest of the eveni "
we were there on 2 consecutive nights & on both occasions it took 90 mins for our main courses to arrive. took the enjoyment out of what would otherwise have been good experiences.
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but won’t eat there again!
"we visited this restaurant this weekend. we decided late so where late with booking the table (same day). it took a while before we where welcomed by ever so sweet but very inexperienced girl. it was her first day so she told us. we had a table up stairs next to a window, it was very cold that day with freezing winds which literately came through the widow. it is an old building therefore not easily heated i imagine. we requested to change tables and this was no problem. we where served by an extremely friendly spanish waiter who clearly was there for the wines as this where he excelled in. i believe they where severely understaffed that night and this resulted in some errors on this front. we got offered a glass of wine on the house to compensate. i had some very nice pata negra as starter which was very nice, the accompanying selection of three kinds of bread with its toppings where well found. main course was a dry aged entrecote which i found a bit blend, even with the aged madera saus the taste was not very outspoken. as postre we had the selection of cheeses which where to cold and therefore lacked taste a bit. overall i think we where their on a difficult night for them and i do see its potential and where they are striving towards. i will return on day for a do over."
"kwalitaria is a chain of fast food restaurants (core business deep fried food and burgers); the kwalitaria schiedam is located in the almost one kilometer long shopping street mgr. nolenslaan. the restaurant is almost at the eastern end of the street. i have mixed feelings about this fast food restaurant. free parking in the street, a quick order at the counter, indoor and outdoor seating area and free wi-fi should attract customers. the food is what you can expect from a fast food restaurant so i got what i wished for, but maybe due to the layout of the restaurant, i didnt feel completely relaxed while eating my fries and salmon burger. however, as this is personal, dont let you stop this from visiting the kwalitaria schiedam."
it was quiet when we went here. staff was friendly and the food was tasty and nice. splitting the bill at the register was not a problem.
my burger was supposed to be a double cheeseburger with bacon and fried egg . i asked no bread to reduce the mount of carbs since i would be having the fries. no problem they sa 
"the person that took our order was very polite and helpful. we got our starters which was ‘okay’ but shortly after that our main dish was served while i was having my starter. which, most definitely, is not the right approach. the burger itself was twice as small as the bread, abnormal."
very bad service!!! everytime we had to wave for some service. waitress is only talking with fellow worker
old fries. old and too much coating and tiny meat in the hot win 
1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"one of the worst fast food experiences in my life. first of all was judged for not speaking dutch and only english, and asking for recommendations were ignored. the staff seemed to hate that they are working on sunday. then i was served hot wings but no fries. they forgot a two piece order with very few people or order "
"lunchroom soof offers coffee, tea, soft drinks, beer, cake, breakfast and hot and cold lunches. what shall i say about soof. they have tried to make an as pleasing ambiance as is possible in a building, that was designed as a shop in the 60s of last century with a good deal of success. service of the waitress is prompt and friendly, the coffee is excellent and the cake delicious. cleanliness is ok, if you disregard the cobwebs in the bathroom area, so why the three point rating. the reason is, that i studied the menu and was amazed about the high prices of the food and drinks in this, lets face it, simple lunch room. even the bill for the cappuccino and cake was already rather eye watering, despite the good quality of the servings. "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"nice atmosphere, friendly service. let down by food quality. the meat dish was mostly good but the vegetarian was poor. undercooked corn tortillas, with processed nacho cheese sauce with what tasted like tinned salsa, with a few tortilla chips from a packet thrown on top..pretty poor effort for the only veg dish on the menu. veggies like nice food too, please try harder."
"was looking for a lunch, light meal. ater 17:00 only dinner menu was available. i choosed chefs choise, a steak. well made, but not more than a ordinary. got a good recomondation on be "
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
very central location. friendly staff. good food. interior lay-out is a bit different. some tlc could be added to the building.
visited here on numerous evenings with work colleagues. the staff were very accommodating and kept the drinks and bar snacks topped up and flowi 
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"theres not much choice of meat, fish and wo "
came here for a business lunch. the buffet offers a good asian style buffet with a grill to prepare stir fry and also has some typical dutch favorites offered.
"we were kicked out before i could finish my drink (or pay extra time) the place was practically empty at that time so i didn’t think it’d be a big deal to relax and finish my drink. it ruined the mood. friendly and helpful staff though, but rule doesn’t work for me. i wouldn’t return."
"we visited this place for a birthday dinner. the location is good, near the water where you can have a good look on the ships passing by. free parking nearby. it was too cold to sit outside, so we went in and were pointed to a table by the friendly staff. inside looks a bit daft, but its part of the experience so to speak with stuffed bears everywhere. ;) some bread for starters, which was good and fresh. several house wines are served by the glass. i ordered the chicken sateh dish, which was simple but good. the fries were a bit cold, but this was solved quick and in a correct manner by the staff. reasonably priced."
this is a reasonable restaurant open late for something to eat and drink.
"they are in the center, and the people are friendly. good beers, sandwiches. nothing special, but very agreeable."
"we’ve been talking about this restaurant several years, finally we’ve visited this restaurant a few weeks ago. the setting of the restaurant is superb, in a quiet green surrounding, almost in the middle of nowhere… as aperitif we had ruinard, one of my favourites, with nicely presented appetizers, a nice start! then my scallops arrived, the first preparation was superb, the second (warm) was overcooked. also my langoustine as second course, first preparation tastes good, second overcooked again. pigeon as main course, could have be tasteful, if it wouldn’t be too salty and overcooked yet again. and to finish a dessert based on blood orange which gave the impression of lack of inspiration… very classic and too heavy me "
25 euro for all you can eat. chefs will prepare special dishes for you. ready food is not allways full which is little bit dissapointing. there is a lot of seats in this restaurant so you will allways get a table. ice creams are really nice. overall 7/10 -3 because food in not allways full
"if you believe a michelin restaurant has to be more then just food, but also about personalized service, passion and ambience... you might end up being sorely disappointed after a dinner at davin "
let’s start with the go 
welcomed at the door we were taken through to the lounge overlooking the water. we were offered a special moet et chandon. some delicious bites were served including an impressive kroepoek snack with great tast 
"the restaurants interior feels like a hotel. not really nice decorated, certainly not up to date. the food is ok but certainly not 2 michelin stars worthy. it seems michelin holland is not as strict. compare this to any 2 stars in belgium, france, spain and you will be disappointed. maybe its trendy go give a raw carrot, cowlyflower etc... as amuse, this is not what i want in a 2 star restaurant. the food was also to rich, heavy, totally not my style. the quality was certainly not bad, just not refined enough."
"for my mothers birthday celebration we went to the kolentip with a party of 10. the view over the maasbracht harbour is very nice, but the temperature at the top floor is much too hot on a warm day (the so-called airco is not fit for purpos "
"one bite out of the fish selection: very overdone! hows your meals? she asked overdone! nothing more! no offer to redo, another selection? nothing! 10/06/2018"
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they aren’t attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasn’t friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldn’t answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help they’d just say “i am the wrong person to ask”. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "
"i visited my hometown beek last month, and went to this restaurant three times. two times for lunch and once for dinner. it is definitely a hot spot for bikers and hikers. the restaurant has a very nice terrace with a beautiful view. the windmill next to the restaurant is a very nice attraction. there are tours to view the windmi "
there was only tapas and you can choose from 6p different bits of tapas. in total 14 for euro 4 
the scenery in the restaurant and on the terrace is very nice. the staff is friendly and accurate. the menu gives a variety of both dutch and international dishes. the winelist is simpel but effective. the price for a simple houswine is over the top.
"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paid…..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"the café has a very cosy atmosphere and is situated in the lovely village of de rijp. the service is friendly and ok. the food choice is limited though, good but not exceptional."
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!😡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15’ for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! don’t waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "
driving around through the polder i decided to eat an early dinner in urk. i landed at the kaap near the lighthouse and went to this fish restaurant with view to the lake/sea si 
"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. it’s definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "
we had not been to urk for many years and decided to revisit urk and enjoy a good fish dinner which should be easy considering that urk is a fishing to 
"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
25 euros for a couple of welcome cava’s 
"not that exciting, service was not too good for this price and staying outside for a drink was not an option, the terrace was almost empty!!! hate it when there is no flexibility. the food was for this price average and the service too. the wine was ok, but altogether it was an average experienc "
"trendy place, nice interior and decent location ... but some quality details made it for me rather average nouvelle cuisine. service can be better, given the price tag you finally pay for these kind of restaurants. and im used to eat from the best brasseries in town till michelin* starred restaurants. not bad, it needs extra attention."
i was invited by a friend to this restaurant which has a great ambiance and good service. however this quality was destroyed by a worm in my fish on the service plate. i guess this was one of the worst experience of my life even this may not be restaurants fault. even the waitress took care of this immediately they did not do anything ekstra for the apology except a free coffee. they could do more for this kind of scandal which will be one of my worst memory...
"nice location in a former pumping station, good food, but very overpriced. one waitress was very accommodating and friendly, the others were distant and cold. we had to wait while one of them put our coats away before we were seated, which took a long time. food was good, but looked better than it tasted. found the whole place rather pretentious and would not likely return."
"definitely not worth a part from the nice furniture, decoration of the interior and exterior sort of church on the si "
"portions too small. owner not friendly, she couldnt even tell me what the dessert was, she only said...its sweet. the cheese tray was small and no explanation as to what cheeses."

"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
"we came with friends and family to this place and we were very disappointed with the service. our order was incomplete, the waitresses came to our table with different orders... they didnt know who order what.  it was a mess."
"this is a nice place for a drink and/or a snack. even dogs are welcome here. many people come here by bike or by foot. some even by horse. i didnt ordered a meal or so, but some beers and snacks. it can be very busy here and the staff is sometimes not able to help everyone as rapidly as they would or as fast as the custumers would like to. the woods surrounding the hut of mie pils are also nice for a walk. if you translate the name it means something like mie beers cabin. mie is the former female owner. "
"this is the place to be when walking in the woods or cycling the area. outside seating is great, buzzing place and good service. quality of food is poor but just come here for a nice belgium beer."
"horrible. i wish i could put minus 5 stars. today we went there for first and last time. before the order we asked if we can pay by a pin card. the waitress said yes and we proceed to order 2 hot chocolates. before we leave, i went inside to pay the bill. a woman informed me that i can pay only by cash. i explained the whole story but they didnt want to admit their mistake and made one of us to stay to the bar and the other one to go and find cash and pay the bill (5.4€). the closest atm from there is about 2,5 klm, and i had no car. so i did all the way back and forth for 5 god damn euros and it wasnt even my mistake. they didnt even apologised for the inconvinience. only a retard can do that to a customer. theyve ruined my day. i would like to go back and punch the owner. please shut down that place and give the keys to someone who knows about how to run a business. so unprofessional. an advise to everybody: just take your own food and eat it near the lake. do not waste your money there. it doesnt worth."
"we visited already several of the loetje restaurants, renowned for their steaks, and down-to-earth experien "
decided to try this place as its loc 
"we decided to drop by to a dinner because it was pretty crowded. we have to wait for a table about 10 minutes and then got a nice table at teracce. we ate beefsteak (they have normal and xl, hama fish with french fries as a side dish and indonesian beefsteak with batat which is a bit spicy. the food was pretty good, we drank tap beer pilsner, but they do not have dark beer in 0.5 bottle (or staff didnt know how to explain)."
"we visited loetje breukelen while on our way to amsterdam. we had to wait quite a while for a table as it was fully booked. as we did not made a reservation that is on us. loetje breukelen was recommended to us so we were quite anxious to get a table rather sooner than later. the food is basic but good. the restaurant was clearly understaffed which resulted in longer than acceptable waiting time for ordering, service and checking out. which is a shame. the overall impression on the food is ok. we missed some inspiration in the lay out of the restaurant and the overall service. it felt we were just a number of visitors. too bad as the potential is clear. work on it."
"we like what the new owners did to this place. it used to be zizi and is now part of the small dutch restaurant chain loetje. the use of wood (beams, floor, stairs) and rope (staircase sides) gives the interior a warm look and feel. the chairs could be more comfortable. the waiting staff is friendly and attentive. food portions are fine. most plates are basic. you can order extra veggies or a side of fries, but the main dishes dont come with them. if you do, the price of a meal goes up to a bit above average. the location is great though."
"we used to visit zizi that was the predecessor of loetje. the menu is a lot different (and a bit pricier), more towards steakhouse food. but they also serve various lunch/brunch sandwiches, salads, pastries, starters, main dishes, side dishes and deserts. you can also go in for drinks with snacks or for a coffee/tea with or without a piece of apple pie. it deserves a chance in this location (close to the bank building that will co-house a hema in the future)."
"booked the restaurant to catch up with someone and had hoped for nice weather so we could have drinks and dinner on the terrace on the vegt. unfortunately, rain so we sat in the conservatory, which was also fine. the hostess came by every 10 minutes with the same question, have you already made a choice?. it was still quite early, and we were still enjoying our drinks and kept indicating this. it was a bit irritating and at the same time also funny. we finally chose a four-course menu with cheese for dessert. each course was delicious and beautifully prepared. the lobster bisque had a good taste. also, during dinner, our hostess was irritatingly present by constantly wanting to sell glasses of wine. the location definitely gets a 10, and the dishes are well flavored and very tasty. the service staff, on the other hand, needs a refresher course in hospitality."
"everything is superb except the guest friendliness. that is why 3 stars, sorry, but costumer service is very important."
"beautiful location. the food is okay but not special. value for money is insufficient, ( 2pax, three course, 150 euro)the bill was incorrect, we had to mention it. and even after we left, we found out they still charged the tasting menu to high. vibes are a bit arrogant."
"we had a family gathering at this restaurant and were thrilled with the setting which is right by the river so outdoor dining was possible in the gorgeous weather. the service was excellent with professional and friendly staff. it suited us for the occasion for it to be slow which indeed it was. we were there for over four hours for a three course meal. the food itself was excellently prepared and cooked but unfortunately, the helpings were so small we felt the a la carte courses provided were more like a tasting menu. very disappointing considering the high cost. if the owners would just be a bit more generous with their vegetables, accompaniments i would be happy to return. the cheesboard contained four tiny pieces of cheese and one tiny slice of bread. wine started at around 28 euros a bottle and the wines we chose were excellent."
"after visiting mos in amsterdam we new it would be hard to beat, and werent wrong. we went for the taster menu and unfortunately it was a real let do "
the service was so terrible !! we ate all bread and still waiting for the food ! the waitress did not have any idea what were the ingredients... never again..
"we had diner here on a sunny evening in august, arrived by boat, parked in front of slangevegt. restaurant looks very nice, location and view is spetacular. we had a lovely table outside next tothe river. nice staff, food was nothing special, in fact we were somewhat dissapointed, very plain taste. recommended on sunny days only."
"we had dinner there this week. we started with 2 glasses of cava. we both had the slangevegt dinner menu of € 37,50 a person. it was the lobster bisque, the iberico pig, and the ice-cream with mango. the bisque was served in a champagne glass with cold foam on top. it was very salty, too salty to finish. the piece of iberico pig that my partner had was almost half fats. the ice-cream was nice. the service could be better for a place like this. we had to wait long before we were given the menu and received the menu after we had already finished our cava. i had a wine suggestion with the first 2 courses. while not having finished my first wine yet, the second was poored and the unemptied glass of white wine was taken aw "
"we had a group dinner here. the style of food was cuisine, nicely presented meals and a nice ambience in the restaurant. on site parking was convenient and the service was quite good. there was not a lot of choice in the menu and although the food was nice, i expected better for the prices we paid. would try again for lunch to see if experience is better without a large group on a busy night as it is a nice location."
"this place is all about the location - its pretty and if the sun is shining you can sit by the river watching the boats go by, a beautiful way to spend an eveni "
very nice location in one of the most expensive area of the netherla 
"we had dinner at slangevegt with a party of four. the restaurant breaths a cosy atmosphere and we were guided to the back of the restaurant where we were seated at the window overlooking the terrace and vecht river. after having an aperitif (we were not offered any hors douvres) we had a starter - i myself had lobster bisque which was served with a scallop - which was good and after that a combination of iberico pig and gambas which was even better. a pity that one of us missed forks and the other knives when the starter came. also, nobody bothered to bring the wine menu so when the starter came, we didnt have anything to drink. then, we ordered a dessert - i had cheese - that took extremely long to arrive. the waiter apologised by offering a free glass of porto which was a nice gesture. anyway, all in all a couple of service flaws but then again, good food and a nice venue. could be a very good but at the moment, slangevegt does not reach that score..."
"the service at this place was terrible. we reserved tables for 21 people, we were assigned 1 young waitress and it took the 2 hours to serve the first course of the 4-course menu."
"i have been going to slangevegt for over 3 years, mostly business but occasionally for pleasure. i always come away feeling like a person whose lover is beautiful but just gives enough to keep you coming back. i just dont feel the love. service overall is not bad but for crying out loud, a menu within 10 minutes wouldnt hurt. the staff are generally very pleasant but need to connect more often with the table- seems i need to ask for service instead of the other way around at times. the food is tasty but overpriced. like many aspiring dutch restaurants it tries too hard on presentation and form rather than taste and value. stop making a show and serve decent portions for main courses. i am not paying for cuckoo spit. you would starve without the appetizer so you will need to order both starter and main course to stave off your hunger. food is very good overall- i just think they should serve more simple quality and manly portions in a timely manner. i expect much more for what i pay but no taking away that this remains a unique restaurant in a beautiful location . like a lover however, no matter how beautiful, you need to start giving something more to keep me hanging on. "
"slangevegt is always a good place to eat or relax at the terrace on the riverside. unfortunetaly the service is very bad. the waiters act like they are the costumer instead of you. thats a pity because the whole formula is great, so i hope there will be some progression made in the service level during thiswinter. when i come back next spring i might reconsider this review."
"keep going back as i love the location and hope each time things will get better with regards to food and service, but no still a big let down. the service is so slow for a 7.30pm booking we still did not get the main course till nearly 10pm, prices are really high for what they serve and the scallops were most definitely frozen not fresh. what ever i say people will still go there because the position on the side of the river and the ambiance is lovely, they just need to tighten up there act. still would reccomend just dont expect value for money or be too hungry!"
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the saté and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didn’t, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service you’d expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also à la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays €3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."
the hot 
the formula of van der valk is renowned in holland. much food for reasonable pric 
"pleasent reception, clean rooms,uncomfertable bedding, adequate restaurant,  but seriously: no pasta? breakfast not included, good average."
"had a quick sunday afternoon drink with some family. to say that the service was poor was an understatement despite plenty of staff walking around. had to ask for drinks and for finger food, almost begging. drinks and food fine, service not"
"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay € 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"fast food near the highway.  just a pitstop or a quick leg stretch.  inefficient staff, not very friendly.  food in line with other restaurants."
the veggie burger  was chicken!  and the fries were cold  very unsatisfying and disappointing the waste bins were full so we could not dispose of our food
"usually we came to mcdonalds only for the drink or ice but this time we took mc veggie, too. its not bad at all. service was oke though its a bit slower than normally mcd."
just wanted a mc muffin quick without bacon and a small coffee. ordered and there was enough staff standing there. it took them almost 15 min. really unbelievable. next to that the bread was dry and probably it was to long cooked.
"i went here twice for breakfast as we stayed in the hotel next door, but i must say that it wasnt really fast-food. i had to wait a minimum of 5 minutes for my breakfast order. quality was as expected and the service is the same everywhere."
"seemed to be the only show in town (italian restaurant closed and another one not serving food on saturday after 18.00 ??), never a good thing. long wait, mediocre food, mediocre service. wont rush back."
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."

"this bistro is perfectly in an old building directly at the village center. nice terrace to sit outside, if the weather lets you with very attentive staff and good food. nice choice of beers and correct wines."
"average dining and drinking establishment. family friendly, reasonable prices. a bit too loud if you prefer a quieter atmosphere."
"this nice place looks at the beginning like and old english pub, in fact has a good selection of beers. food is also classic of a pub, but with some taste specialties. service is welcoming and quick. definitely worth of a stop if you are on the way."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; it’s just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
"the good news is that de beren eetcafé is easily accessible, because the restaurant is situated on the n209 main thoroughfare, close to the bleiswijk ramp on the a12 motorway. furthermore, a spacious parking lot with free parking is part of the restaurant complex. more good news is, that a three course meal is obtainable for € 19.99, value for money in a dutch restaurant. the restaurant is spacious, but the atmosphere is a bit like the burger king, if the burger king had put in a bar and went with the appointments for varnished wood. furthermore, too loud music was being played over the loudspeaker system. the bad news is, that the service and food left much to be desired. service of the staff was pleasant, but a bit bumbling and unpolished (not unique for a dutch restaurant) but broke down completely after the main course. we had to wait 20 minutes till the table was cleared and another 10 minutes till a member of the staff noticed our presence and took our order for dessert. in the mean time, members of the staff were flitting past our table, carrying plates with spare ribs (it was unlimited spare ribs evening). the same thing occurred after the bill was presented. it was impossible to attract the attention of the staff to bring the change. in the end i went to the cashiers desk and got the change there. keep in mind that the restaurant was not understaffed, but insufficient attention was payed to individual tables. about the food: after a promising start, carpaccio, (again augmented with spurious ingredients and salad leaves, but that is, unfortunately, the dutch way), the main course, tuna steak, (one of my favorites) was a disaster. the desert, chocolate nut cake, was of supermarket quality; a helping of vanilla ice cream along side the cake could not mask that impression. furthermore, my table companions complained to me about the substandard quality of the pork and that too much salt was used in the peanut sauce. the reason that i had selected de beren eetcafé in bleiswijk was that i had visited a sister restaurant in schiedam a short while ago (see my review) and was impressed by the skilled cooking in a unpretentious atmosphere, but de beren eetcafé in bleiswijk was a disappointment and we will keep to the schiedam branch in the future."
"really nice location, with normal but good food. the menu has the standard meals like carpaccio, soup, steak, safe and salmon. service is really nice. they were extremely quick with drinks, starter and dessert but for the main course we had to wait longer which was hard for the kids as they were hungry."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck

"we went for a family birthday lunch on a sunday. we choose the restaurant because it offers an a la cart menu; because some of us don’t like fish and would like to eat the vegetarian or meat options. arriving at the restaurant, we had to call twice before they would open the gates for the parking lot. this should have been a warning. one of the tables was unsteady, so we asked for a coaster to support the table. they promised to do it immediately, but instead were busy discussing the daily life. we asked again, and got a rather annoyed look from the staff but in the end did receive the coaster. when we received the menu, not all of us wanted the surprise 3/4 course menu or the regular 3/4 course menu. since the waiter didn’t inform us that those two menus were the only options, we wanted to order a la cart options, but were informed in a rather condescening way that this was absolutely not possible. only when we said that most items on the menu for a certain member was not possible, did it become possible if the whole table would make the same order. although we did receive an apology for that choosing a la cart options was not possible, we thought the communication was bad. in the end we selected a couple of courses from the chef’s menu, and we also added wine for each course. we received the first two courses within 2,5 hours, and asked for a cheese plate prior to desert. it took 1,5 hours before we received the cheese plate; by the time we asked for the cheese plate again, it arrived within 10 minutes and the desert arrived 15 minutes later. we had the wine with all the food, except with the desert no wine was given. and when asked for it, it was too much effort to arrange it for us (even though they receive a fair amount of money for the wines if they had arranged it for us "
"we celebrated our weddings day there, ordered a surprise 4-course menu. unfortunately not surprised. the wine selection was good, the beefsteak was too raw and bitter, cheese too simple for a surprise. i do not recommend - a good service though."
"food is well prepared, good taste and textures, executed with great flair. really wish ingredients (beef) could have been better quality.  service is sketchy, from slow to patronizing."

"where to go on a monday evening? we thought we would like to come back at savarin. it became a big disappointment. the new decoration made the restaurant very noisy, also before the big group entered. it is hard to handle such a group without spoiling the evening of the others, it became clear the staff couldn’t. for half an hour no table was actually served in the whole restaurant. the staff appeared more instructed than trained, saying the right things on the wrong moment. also with good intentions it is hard to work in the wrong setti "
"as we live in old rijswijk we thought of giving this restaurant a try. the quality of the food was very good and the very young and rather inexperienced waiters did their best in a satisfactory way. our problem came with the dessert. there were two desserts of choice: one based on blueberry mousse and sorbet, and the other based on cheese panna cotta. we all ordered the panna cotta, but, t our surprise, we were all served with the blueberry mousse. we notified the waiter who obviously didnt know what to do, so he went back to check with his superior. when he returned to our table he started explaining us that the blueberry sorbet is in fact some kind of cheese panna cotta. as we didnt like to be taken for idiots, we asked for his superior. when his superior came, he had a very arrogant and patronising attitude and restated that the blueberry sorbet is in fact the panna cotta we ordered. he was very persitent and i had to confront him with the menu to make him admit that there was some confusion. this attitude is absolutely unacceptable from somebody working in services and who has the minimum respect for his customers and for his job! but apparently the guy doesnt have any notion about respect as he was trying to lie us up-front."
"chefs of restaurant savarin, part of les jeunes restaurateurs deurope, not only display culinary craftsmanship oriented on european gastronomy but also use organic ingredients. a special voucher action brought us to savarin, where they served us a three-course menu with veal as main course. the meat was tasty, it had a reasonable quantity and was complemented with only one asparagus, a little heap of sweet potatoes and a tablespoon of mushrooms. it seems that savarin only likes to fill up the restaurant, but refrains from attracting new customers with voucher deals. the price for this menu was too expensive for what was offered to us."
"visited restaurant savarin with our birthday party. from the moment we made our reservation we experienced the poor quality in service of the restaurant staff. a 3 course dinner is rather expensive at euro 49,50 and contains no special dishes, but the frustrating part of the evening was the coffee/tea. coffee was served without the sugar/milk tray for which we had to ask at the bar, but most of all the sweets were served after we had finished our coffee. btw. we did not order the friandises, but they were put on the table without asking. i mentioned that we were given the friandises after we had fisnished our coffee to the head waiter and he said he was sorry about this, but that was it.

"i usually only write reviews when i really liked a dinner, but this time i was so disappointed that i make an exception. we had thought about going to the savarin restaurant for some time, so when there was a special voucher action, we figured it was the right time to try. unfortunately, it is obvious that they are not trying to win new customers with their voucher deals, but just to fill up their restaurant. while the food was tasty, the menu was totally basic, so that in the end the price we paid with the rebate actually still felt overpriced. but ok, i understand that they cut a few corners there and you just dont get as good a deal as you had hoped. what really surprised me was the level of service. it starts with the fact that they put way too many tables in the restaurant, so that the servers have to squeeze between the tables. guests are constantly moving their chairs because the feel they have to make room for the passing servers. of the three servers we had only 1 was close to the standard i expect from a restaurant with a 50 euro menu. one forgot was on the plate when trying to explain the main course, the other never bothered to ask whether we liked the dinner when removing the plates. the waiter did not see when glasses were empty and it took ages to be able to order drinks. not just for us, but also at the surrounding tabl "

"this restaurant pretends to be upscale, but serves poor quality food. our group (15 people) had to wait more than an hour for the main course because as the staff explained they had a lot of guests to serve. which made me wonder what we were.... this place has to learn a lot about food, very poor quality and serving guests."
"my parents were celebrating their 63rd wedding anniversary with my siblings at de wits on 28.08.2021. i could not come as i live in the uk. i called the restaurant, while they were having dinner, to order a bottle of champagne as a surprise for them, offering to pay by credit card. regrettably, the person answering the phone at de wits (i guess the owner/manager) said no, i cant do it as im too busy, and theyre all drinking fris (soft drinks) anyway. not only does he turn my business away, but he seems to feel entitled to decide what his guest should be drinking. some attitude, h "

"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros •	nice terrace in busy street •	excellent wine is available •	service is good •	prices are realistic, not too high  con’s •	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"
"good beers and decent food. nice and friendly staff, pleasant place to enjoy the evening when you are around rijswijk central."
"had chicken burger for about eur15; came with fries and small salad. sat outside on the terrace which was good in the heat - although the serving staff seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves rather than attending to customers. had to constantly flag them down, for drinks, cutlery etc."
its located in walking distance to the winston hotel.  the drinks are very good and you get also something to eat.   i have had the sate. recommendable.  no restaurant for a grande dinner.  but quite ok.   staff is very friendly.
"ok, been there multiple times now and i think it might be time to talk about this o "

this was better in its old style. it had character and had staff with good attitude. not so much now.
we had a late night meal here on our last night in the netherlands. the food was good pub style fare. the service was the best we had on the trip to nl. they had some good local beers on tap which is something i look forward to when i travel.
"had dinner here on a friday night. its typical dutch pub food: gambas, salmon filet, sate, fries, e.g. nothing fancy but a good pub dinner."
"stopped here for a quick dinner. great beer selection, i love brugse zot and have not seen it outside bruges before, highly recommende "
the service and ambiance are still great. beer selection wasnt as good this time around. food was definitely not as good. i had the parma and melon which was ok except that the melon was honeydew instead of cantaloupe. i then had the pork tenderloin in pepper sauce which i didnt like much at all. hmmm. i am struggling to find motivation to come back here...
"have surprised these guys with reservations for 12-14 people at last minutes notice, and its never been a problem. food is good, service friendly. comparable to english pub food, bit higher quality,  and more choice."
"nice friendly eating cafe in rijswijk, also friendly for a drink in the evening. nice atmosphere and friendly."
this is a very local watering hole. has been there for over 30 years and a good place to have a drink and bitterballen. its nice enough but what is a shame is that to get inside you have to go through the front conservatory seating bit where there is a big cloud of cigarette smoke.
lady who was taking order by mcdrive was very rude. it happened 1 september around 17.10. this is the reason that we are not going to visit this place anymore.
bram ladage is a typical dutch snack bar located in the bogaard shopping centre in rijswijk. the french fries were ok but not as stunning as their self created reputation would support. at 3 euros (with sauce) the smallest sized helping was not cheap in my view. they do have a nice shared seating area in the sun in front of them. 
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because it’s close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, i’ve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but i’d rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so i’d like them better"
"we were a company of several people who had different dishes. the meat or fish was good, but the side dishes were boring. as everywhere else in the netherlands they only serve french fries and creamy sauces. very good service and friendly staff!"
"doppio espresso is situated in the covered shopping center koningshoek in maassluis. this shopping center has the advantage of all weather shopping and lots and lots of free parking. doppio espresso has an inviting appearance with tables inside and outside in the wide passage. not unexpected through the name of the establishment italian food and drinks are offered and efforts are made to create an italian atmosphere. i settled for a common black coffee, because i didnt want to experience the disappointment of an inadequate espresso and it was too late for a cappuccino. cannoli were on offer and i couldnt resist ordering one. the cannolo was better than expected, but the envelope was a bit hard. generally a good effort was made by the staff to create an italian atmosphere, but unfortunately the eye watering prices were very un- italian. a three point rating."
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"

"theres little to redeem this place. set on the side of a shopping centre and over-looking the brutalist building of the local city hall, the food was equally uninspiring. its trying to lean up-market but should really stick to capturing the shoppers for coffee & cake or a lunch-time sandwich."
"this restaurant, situated in the heart of charming, water-rich maassluis, operates under a french name, monsieur paul. however, they offer a typical english dish, high tea. this high tea consists of tea in several flavours, sandwiches and as piece de resistance, an etagere with a variety of sweet food, pastries, scones, chocolates, you immediately associate with england. so far so good. the tea tasted good and the food was of good quality. however, i will never get used to the ambiance and service in dutch restaurants. the tables were so small that there was barely room for the etagere, teapot and two cups. furthermore, the tables were so close together that i had to be careful not to swipe my neighbours teacup from his table. and the service of the staff. the dutch are not so good in making customers welcome, compared to staff in other countries. oh, the waitresses were friendly, but serving customers is a profession, even an art and, what i remarked, the dutch havent mastered this yet."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than € 6,00 per bottle….!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!

"personnel is rude and very unwelcoming. i went cycling and forgot water at home so stopped here for a snack and to drink some water. the waiter was not very helpful and basically told me to find myself a table outside (it was completely empty inside, but apparently not possible to find a spot for one person) i sat outside, a very rude young female waitress came and took my order refusing to speak english even when it was clear that i could not speak dutch. i finally got my cache and the water. i paid wuivkly because i did not want to be there much longer and she grabbed my half full glass of water that i wanted to drink yo make space for next customers. i had to grab my glass and tell her i was not finished. she left the glass and proceeded to seat a family of 4 people at my table while i was still sitting and finishing my water. i usually don’t complain about service in restaurant but this was just a bit too much! really unacceptable behavior. don’t go there unless you are dutch and very blond."

"this is a restaurant of 12 in a dozen. nice if you are in the neighborhood but not really worth the travel. we had a very niece evening but that ws primarily because of our the audience. the menu is very conservative, the selection of wines not very exciting. food was ok prepared but my steak was well done while i ordered medium. it is these little things that make it average. the price is very reasonable. so we had a good night but the restaurant was nothing special."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.
"having been a bit spoiled the past few days with the enya and slangevegt restaurants, this was certainly a couple of steps lower on the scale. saying that, the bill was also a fair bit lowe "
was first visit. we came to watch the jam sessio 
"we had a worklunch here and it was alright. some of my collegeaus advised for either the hotdog or the hamburger. i picked the first option, and it was alright. the fries were a big let down, they were way too hard and i had trouble getting them onto my cutlery. the hotdog was alright, nothing to special. my rule is that i like to get something i would not make in my own kitchen as it is either too much work, or i do not have the skills to make an excellent portion. in this case, i could have made this lunch in a fashion more too my likin "
"in a warm evening we had a dinner there with friends. kind staff, starters and food satisfying, but could not be considered excellent."
this is what the most people like: cosy and not too high standards for delicacy. we only had a starter: looked pretty but without feeling for good cooking.
"we came in for a quick dinner after a long trip. only after we had finished our drinks we became aware of the fact the kitchen opnend after 6 pm, although we directly ordered it wasnt mentioned to us. the quality of the food was poor, small rations and lousy french fries. however after travelling through belgium is was a pleasure to be served by adequate staff."
i visited this establishment with a business friend and it started out perfectly nice on the terrace next to the canal. sun was shining a good beer and glass of wine. we were helped by a young man who just started so wasn’t up to speed yet but charming and helpful. one other waitress was also pleasant enough. but one waitress had an attitude and that is just not acceptable in the hospitality indust 
"the restaurant has a sitting area on the vecht where u can have a drink or eat. as starter i had the tuna which was quite disappointing in terms of taste, presentation and size. it was very tiny pieces of tuna in a lot of broth. we enjoyed the main course more. the beef was tender and tasty. the fish was an average pan fried one...the service was good."
"this is a great example of a wanna be. great terrace on the river vecht but thats about it. meat was dry, gnocchi were anything but that and when i asked about it i was informed that the square, deep fried things on the plate were indeed gnocchi. worst meal i have had in a long time! "
"this restaurant has a fantastic terrace next to the river that flows through maarssen... we were here on a summers evening, so it was packed. the food was of a very high quality and the service was good ... all good, and was close to giving it 4/5. perhaps next time :-)"
"situated in hoogland nearby amersfoort. the restaurant is in a new building but very local flavored. the dining area is separated from the bar area. we had a christmas dinner with approx 24 persons. three courses, choose from a fixed menu. good food, tasty and enjoyable. service is good considering so many people visiti "
"the place was hopping with locals , as the pizza place next door was empty. the food was good , the service was slow ( because it was busy "
"the starters were really nice, freshly baked bread, nice carpaccio and salad "
"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."
"i took my daughter, her husband and their two children, ages 8 and 6, to dekooi on saturday, april 22 before i returned to the u. "
"de koooi is beautifully situated, new and modern in an old looking building. perfect fit with the surroundings. quality of the presented menu is average, prices are well above the restaurants in the village/centre of spakenburg. either boost the quality or lowering prices should be done. at this moment the scenery is nice, but lunch/dinne"
"great food if you can spare the time. service is poor, waiting times are much too long. i could say that the food is wordt waiting, but it isn’t we scrapped the restaurant of our list. it’s a restaurant voor a quick dinner, not for a evening filling programm."
"the atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy, however the food is very very poor. we ordered salmon and it was all covered by a sauce that killed the taste of the fish. at the bottom of the salmon there was some pasta overcooked and insipid (lack of salt in the water when cooked "
"i made a reservation on line which was accepted and when we arrived , they refused us !! the restaurant closed 2 ours later (we ate in an other just in front "
i was here for dinner with my family last we 
"fine food and good service. the menu is ok and let you choose between meat, fish en salads. the menu is simple but adequate"
"the location is absolutely nice:close to the harbour of spakenburg. when you can sit on the terrace this place is really nice. however, the food and price are not more than average."
"we had lunch here in september and the service was terrible. we ordered two toasties and had to wait over thirty minutes. i had ordered a tuna melt and was very unhappy that it contained chilli, i struggle with chilli and it was not mentioned on the menu! would not return."
"in the netherlands this type of eating is normal. you can order almost anything that you can fry. like the kroket and frikadel... this establishment offers plates too and its not bad. so if you are in for a snackbar, this one is a good one"
"we had lunch on the terrace near the water, which was good. the staff was friendly and the service was fast. and of course we were excited to eat out again after lockdo "
"we had to wait so long for our food, it ruined the evening. waiting staff tried hard but obviously the kitchen/management could not cope. what a disappointment."
we arrived hungry and had to wait 15 minutes to get any attention in a restaurant with only 3 tables ful 
"we just had a quite drink here before visiting the castle. the place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. the staff is friendly but it is an understatement to say that the so-called espresso is really underwhelming. if you want a decent coffee, better to have it in the castle itself."
"right in front of the castle cannenburch in vaassen the location of this restaurant is amazing! the food is good, the staff is young and seems inexperienced."
"we were just at the bierbrouwerij on saturday. it was a beautiful, warm day and the place is very nice. we had a large group-- it was a family reunion with about 35 people ages 8 to 8 "
"the place is great, the food is not (anymore). has there been a chefs change? we ordered chicken risotto and the vegetarian wellington. the risotto was undercooked and not fresh (warmed in microwave?). the vegetarian wellington was a lot of puff pastry with almost no filling. you literally had to search for it. i would seriously advise the owner to search for a new chef, as todays food scares of people."
"we had lunch at this restaurant, its kind of a fast food restaurant with its speciality, chicken, since 1957. we just got french fries and drink. by nice weather you can sit outside, there is a lot of space."
when you walk in the restaurant you get a nice atmosphere and get your own seati 
"in uk, we used to wait to be seated, here you walk and get served. at first the dutch lady who served me did not speak much english, and could not tell me the special, then tried to sell me something off the menu then got another waiter who was really good, gave me the run down, starters, soups, then mains half a chicken etc.plus help your self salary, not much to say. if you like harvester salary, then your be very disappointed he "
never go there please. they don’t know the word service! rude personnel as well. they were unable to exchange €2.00.
"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"restaurant smulwereld de poshoorn has evolved from a fast food restaurant to an establishment with a wider scope, by offering also a menu with chinese dishes. as de posthoorn is run for the last couple of years by a family from the far east, this is not surprising. ordering is at the counter; the food is brought to you at your table. the service is polite and genuine hospitable, the fries are prepared with fresh cooking oil and the prices are moderate. furthermore, outside seating is provided, so you can watch the life in voorhuizen go by while eating your burger or babi panggang. not a restaurant on the must do list, but a safe bet for a quick and inexpensive meal when in the neighborhood."
"smulwereld de posthoorn is good for a quick stop on the way the replenish your stomach. de posthoorn has many advantages over the big fast food chains: it is situated in the center of voorthuizen at the road parallel to the main road through voorthuizen with no parking restrictions, the restaurant has the traditional counter with the deep fryers for take-away, but there is a cosy corner with 4 tables with sit-down service. the food is of course the dutch kaleidoscope of deep fried food products, but the french fries with sauce, salad and kroket, frikandel, satay and more are served on real plates with real cutlery. far better than the big chains. the restaurant is quiet, no blaring music and when the weather is clement, there are outside tables to seat at, even improving the experience, eating and watching the traffic go by. unfortunately, voorthuizen is in the middle of the veluwe, popular with tourist on bicycle tours, so the outside tables tend to be snapped up quickly. no culinary feats are accomplished at de posthoorn, but it is ok within their limitations."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "
after visiting radio kootwijk we stopped at this cafetaria for something cool. the location is in the shopping centre of voorthuizen. its very nice sitting outside on the bench with a cup of ice in your hand
"the restaurant kwalitaria de daltons is a fast food restaurant in the center of voorthuizen. the restaurant is, together with a row of shops, situated along a medium sized parking lot. dont forget to put out the parking disc; parking is time controlled here. it was glorious weather, so we settled down on the outside terrace for a quick lunch. this terrace is a bit dingy and cramped, but it serves the purpose. service on the terrace is offered, but was spotty and aloof, so we ended up ordering the food and drink at the counter and we took the serving tray with our order to our table ourselves. the food, french fries with a vegetarian snack, was mediocre, even taken into account the reduced expectations you have of a fast food restaurant. prices were at the upper side of the expectations. kwalitaria de daltons will not be our first choice in the future when stopping in voorthuizen."
it took the waiter a long time to arrive at our table to take our ord 
"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
stopped here for a snack after visiting muiderslot castle. not the warmest of welcomes. food was ok. not much else to say.
by far the worst mcdonalds ive ever been to. cold food. low working pace. rude employees. dont go!
friendly staff and they fixed the issue by taking it off the bill without having to ask for it. the chips were also fantastic and my wife enjoyed her pea so 
"from the first moment our waiter was all but welcoming. after some low quality fried typical dutch appetizers, the 6 of us had to wait 55 minutes for our main course. when prompted why it was taking so long for the fish & chips the waiter replied: thats because you ordered the appetizers! (?!?). when finally the food came the chips were hardly warm, no crispy and the crust around the cod was overcooked, really hard to crush. we were mildly vocal about the all thing and the same waiter not even apologetic... despite the order came out even wrong as one of us had requested chicke "
"we got to sit at 13:30, and the main dishes at 3:20. we were told that we had to wait so much since we took starters, and it was our fault."
"this pub should have everything going for it. location, atmosphere etc but the service was truly dreadful. there were 11 customers inside and another 8 on the terrace. my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and a red wine. simple enough you might think. ten minutes later we still had not been served despite the fact there were 4 employees wandering about. we gave up and went across the road to ome kos where we got immediate service."
"stopped to get some drinks and snacks, regretfully no table available in the shade. we waited quite long without getting any service, heating up more and more. luckily a table freed at the neighbors, so we left and got instant service."
"on a sunny evening, visit this restaurant with a terrace directly next to the canal. as you see the boats pass by, enjoy your dinner at the waterfront. when its the season order mussels. youll get a big pan full of mussels. service is bit slow."
"i was so disappointed when i came here with my wife and a couple of friends as a stop on our cycle around het gooi. we each ordered a beer and a tapas plateau to share (for €13.50) from the borrelkart (drinking snacks menu) expecting that it would be an adequate snack for the 4 of us, however the plateau came out with a few paltry slices of meat and a thin crust of bread. when we questioned the quantity we were told that the plateau was a starter for 1 person (despite it being on the drinking snack menu) and that we could not return it in lieu of another item. we were incredibly disappointed by both the food we ordered and by the service we received during our visit, and as such we would not recommend this bar when there are so many pleasant venues within such a small town."
"called here for a late lunch after visiting the castle. the terrace is directly next to the canal, with a view over the bridge and all the boats going though the locks. menu was fine, if limited. the quality of the food we had, was good and the staff very helpful. well worth trying here, if only for the position in the town."
"my, my boyfriend any my best friend went to amsterdam for a short trip. we cycled to muiderslot castle (15km one way) and have a walk around the castle and the garden. before we decided to cycled back, we wanted to have a lunch and decided for this place which was the worst idea ever. we sat inside as it was very warm outside and wanted to cool down a little b "
"the restaurant had a great atmosphere it was a typical old dutch cafe and the decoration added a nice touch. it also has a nice location near the river. when we sat down, we had to wait quite a while for someone to come take our order and after that even longer until the food was served. the people were not particularly friendly either. the food, when it came, was very nice but that did not completely make up for the poor service."
right next to uncle ko situated. just a fisherman eatery. do not expect haute cuisine. but certainly in the herft or in early spring a great place to sail to eat after a day.
"we waited 20 minutes for a table outside because they wouldnt let us sit inside which was completely empty. when a table came free outside, the waiter slapped a reserved sign down. we cycled on to naarden which was much prettier and had more choices of cafes with friendlier people. "
"the food is nice, but as the place was crowded, it took a long time to be served. some of the dishes from the menu were sold out (i wanted to order cod but there was none left). very noise and popular, busy and conviviaal though."
"this place has been here forever and ive been coming here for over 30 years. menu is still the same, food is decent, but service seems to be deterioratin "
a very nice spot in a little town. its a cosy place for a lunch or dinner. i come here now and then for over many years and it didnt change that much. its still good and they have nice food. try the sat 
"when you go to a restaurant its not just the food, its quality, service and atmosphere. we got none of this today. unbeliavebly horrible pasta, vongole and one plain for a kid. cheap patè. all dishes, pretending to be french cousine, are arranged well in advance and poorly heated on the spot before serving. only 6 more guests present for lunch and the service was disorganized and slow. the plateau royal was hilarious, stale oysters, sparse grilled(?) shrimps and a raw half lobster."
"we wanted to eat at a french restaurant in muiden for bastille day. we spotted dedeolen right near the locks with an eclectic interior. the menu was difficult to discern the difference between starters or main dishes, without much help from our waiter who probably was the owner. there was also a 3 or 4 course fixed price meal, which referred to a separate menu, which was never provided. one of us ordered a salad nicoise, which arrived with no potatoes, anchovies or olives, basically overcooked tuna on salad with canned mushrooms. when we inquired about the lack of the standard ingredients, the waiter said thats the way we serve it here. the unpleasantness continued to the end when we got the bill. it included the price of a large portion of a plate, when we clearly ordered ordered a small portion, and a plate that we clearly did not order. on complaining, the waiter questioned our dispute and didnt believe he had included a non ordered plate. when we counted the number of dishes he reluctantly adjusted the bil "
a small restaurant with a great atmosphere. food was small and was still hubgty after the visit. waiters were not focussed and soft drinks were hot.
"i understand that everybody has to cope with staff shortages. but what happened last night was not oke. i know it’s not the serving staff’s fault. but we left straight after our main course, because by the time we had finished that, it was too dark for a desert, let alone a cup of coffee. we sat down at the table at 19.20, finished main course at 22. "
"this is a place of two halves, inside they think rugs work as table cloths but outside it’s a river side bar with modern tapas style men "
"we came as a family , the service was really not nice at all , they asked us to change the table twice without any clear reason , we asked for reasons and we said that it is just a cup of coffee . the woman who is in charge is not nic "
"location is perfect: 5 mins walk from the castle and right on the canal. your typical dutch cafe, nice and easy. sandwiches are nice, regular dutch prices, which are generally speaking quite high for the food they offer. staff is nice but service is slow."
"ive been living in the netherlands for over 4 years and im used to the low level of service and courtesy of restaurant/bar staff here, but the staff at cafe ome ko is really raising the bar in terms of rudeness. the waiter first didnt let me parking my bike in a space which doesnt belong to the cafe at all (i checked with local authorities) and asked us rudely to remove them. we did and when we came back he already gave the table to another person, claiming we went away for parking bikes, so the next in line takes the table. even if the other customer, more courteous, understood the situation and gave us back our table, we decided to leave immediately since the very uncomfortable situation and the explicit hostility of the waiter. we move to the brasserie just 20 meters away and get a very good service. never again."
"i have mixed feelings about writing this review. i wavered between 3 and 4 but had to settle on 3 in hopes that maybe the owners would see this and make some changes. we stopped in for lunch after visiting muiderslot. it was a beautiful day so we sat outside near the canal. the water locks are there as well as a rotating bridge to let the boats thru the canal. it was enjoyable watching the activity going on there and helped pass the time while we waited and waited for service. the wait staff was nice and friendly but just very slow, which may not have been all their fault, and not as attentive as we had hoped. when we sat, there were not that many other customers there. after we ordered, many new people came who seemed to get food before we did. we only ordered soup and a fried egg platter so we didnt think it would take that long. luckily we were not in a hurry. my friend had eggs with bacon and cheese and enjoyed her meal. i had french onion soup, but i forgot it is not made differently here in this country. it had a very bland white broth which really needed lots of salt to make it edible. we also asked for water multiple times and it wasnt until the check was asked for that the final reminder got us some water...well, one of us that is. would i come back? not sure. i would probably try another cafe before giving this one a second chance. again, staff seemed nice, just needed to give the patrons a little more attention. there seemed to be enough working, so i dont think they were short handed."
"my husband and i stopped by for a quick beer and snacks. well, it ended up to be a long wait, no service and a bitter experience. we found an empty table in the crowded outside seating, and there were used cups and plates on the table. while we were waiting patiently, more people came after us and sat behind, next and the front of our table. though their tables were cleaned and the customers drinks were served, the waiters didnt even come to clean the table nor looked at us so we can ask them to clean the table and get a menu. after waiting there at the dirty table for 15 minutes or so, we left. we obviously didnt look dutch and felt that we were treated this way because of our racial background (asian and latino). my husband and i traveled around the world and had a meal from a small kiosk to a 5 start restaurant. this was the first time when i was treated indifferently and in a disrespectful manner. avoid here if you want to be treated respectfully. "
"our dutch host thought this would be a great place to take us to eat after visiting muidenslot. everyone who comes to the netherlands needs to try sate. unfortunately, it was the worst chicken sate (or was it really dog meat?) i have ever tasted. our host was embarrassed because we confessed that we couldnt eat it. it was that bad. they were embarrassed that we couldnt eat it, but confessed they hadnt eaten there for 20 years and hadnt realised the standards have dropped quite significantly. we paid something like 20 euros each for the most appalling looking chicken brochette. the meat was unpallatable. aside from that, the fries had clearly come straight from a packet, the salad and sate sauce all came in tubs that had the plastic taken off. this was fast food of the nastiest, cheapest kind. we left our meat, and told the waiter we cant eat it, its cheap meat, and you can taste it, to which he replied : well everyone else liked it. really, we should have left without paying. if you want good sate, go to cafe 10 @ tuin in amsterdam."

"food was okay, location is good, service is very bad. first you are not allowed on terrace to have only a few drink, one have to eat here. after ordering some lunch and just after food arrived a larger group came to sit next to us but had too few space, couple of times they were told out loud by the waiter that our table was free very shortly so they could all sit normally. we were just eating our lunch and took our time of course. but when i paid the bill i was not even given time to stuck away my wallet, the table was cleaned while i was still sitting there getting my stuff together so rude it was. "
stopped in here for drinks while passing through town with a large group of three to four tables on the pat 
"we ordered two coffee for me and my wife and 1 smoozy for our kid, but all other people around us (that also came later) got their orders (same coffee and smoozy as well), we asked waiter a few times to bring the order faster as we really need to go soon. without real help, he just said that theyre busy. after waiting of 30 minutes (!!!! yes - half an hour for drinks) i came inside caffee to asked whether its ready or we can just cancel it as we dont have time anymore, but bartender jumped out of the bar and started scream on me like in front of my friend, another waiter and people: yes, were busy! in what country its not normal for you to wait such time for drinks?! dont talk to me like this! take your coffee, pay money and get out of here as soon as possible!. if he would not be so small and fancy guy a few times less than me im sure he would start a fight, but after he came too close to me he realized that he overestimated himsel "
"not so good food is below expectation, simpel , far from being named as restaurant  service was poor, i get it, it was busy day"
"terrible service, the food was not bad, but the service is the worst i have ever had.  it is a pity that the place has a very good location."
"ordered from the lunch card sardines, flammekuche bacon and one with salmon and a hamburger. the sardines were big and really nice. the flammekuche were really small and not enough for a lunch. the burger was ok. coffee was good. all in all it was a little pricey for what we order "
"at the spot where earlier an italian restaurant was located is now a dutch brasserie with nice weather find (not easy, because is populair)  a table near  the waterfront. great fun to watch sailors struggle. the food is considering the attractive price a deal good."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
the waiter had no manners at a 
"the meal was good but its too expensive for what it was. so simple yet so expansive. moroever, the water costs 6 euros ?!! what kind of water is that to be this pricey..."
"the food is very good. i wish they had more options.  the price is not a fair price. they dont take your order you have to walk to them once you want to order food.  friendly people, i just wish there was value for money."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   i’d have coffee again but i’d leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
this is just a very low key dining experience but the food was well prepared.  it overlooks the river which adds to the experience.
good location but lacking in food performence. the dutch like their fries and know how to cook them. but here served lukewarm&soggy. the fish was deep fried and the sate not well grilled. this can be done a lot better even in the dutch kitchen m. but again the location is nice and next time i will go for the cafetaria and take the white bun with kroket with mustard and enjoy it outside on one of the bench 
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20€ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. i’m not sure i’d bother going again. 
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 €. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
"you can have a great party i guess, but it is an old brown bar, that is in need of some tlc. you can play biljart and you can sit down at a slotsmachine, and you can have some coffey and pie if you are visiting schoonhoven."
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.

"while the food was pub level, that wasnt the main issu "
"we coming for try and drink something , the waitress don’t speak english and she was so lazy, she  forgot to bring one beer whit only 4 table in all the restaurant , the spicy burger was not spicy"
worst place ever ordered food in advance for later two hours befor 
no star. but star prices. amuses. 15 per glas. very young personnel. so where is the change. basically the same as in the past but higher prices.
"the expectations to this place was bigger than the experience. the food and wine was okay, apart from a wines that did not match the sweetness of the desert. the staff tried their best, but there were too few waiters on too many tables. this dragged the whole experience down, as we had to wait very long between each serving. price was ok."
"it wasnt really spectacular. perhaps we xpected too much but sometimes the experiments in the nouvelle cuisine are overdone. the taste is still the most important. a very big wine card and i must admit the sommelier gave us good advise. we dont want the wine included menu and so his advise was necessary. the personnel is very friendly as well, but the result wasnt as expected"
"whilst i cannot deny that the food at la trinite is fantastic, unacceptable service and unprofessional staff means that this restaurant does not warrant michelin star stat "
"before they moved to their current location, we went multiple times and had always had a good time. we were a party of four, and decided last minute to go have dinner at their new location. we were quite early, compared to other parties. we had an aperitif and received some appetizers that, we thought, gave a good first impression. we chose the menu, and were extremely disappointed by the portions. first of all they were very small and it took a long time before the dishes followed. we were set first at table and ended with the last table set. we had to wait a long time, we had to eat a lot of bread to feel satisfied, not ok! also the main course, pigeon, was served with almost no vegetables, too bad. we had ordered an extra dish, the beemster xo (10€ extra) and hoped for an original preparation of it. instead we received 5 pieces of cheese with some mustard (again disappointed, for a 1 star michelin you have other expectations "
"i came here with my family, there were 8 of us in the party so at first we thought this place was a great find as it seemed spacious and modern. unfortunately the service was rude and very inattentive. the food was ok but nothing specia "
"we called in here before dinner for two glasses of cava, which seemed reasonable value at €6. we visited again on another occasion and had two glasses of the house red. this was a big mistake as it was probably the worst red wine we had ever had in our lives, it was undrinkable. we will definitely avoid the house wine in future."
not much else to say really. this is located in a busy area of a busy town so is good for a coffee or beer sitting at the tables outside and watching the world go by. free wifi too if you ask for the code.
we eat at the outside terrace. good location close to a square and in one of the main shopping streets. we were note very much impressed with the moules- frites we eat there. when serving the food the flies came along. big portions but not tastefull at all. overpriced at 27.5 euro a pers 
disappointing: we were four people but only one of us was satisfied with her fo 
"unlimited mosselen sounds wow isn’t? in my opinion is just ok, but for this price what else do we need to complain??! service are nice, their staff were friendly and nice view to sit outside. only need to be aware with cars that always passing by next to u"
"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garçon served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.
"where should i start : slow and rude service, wrong orders, uncooked and cold food which is ridiculously overprice "
"first the good stuff: the service is good, the waiters are very friendly and very helpf "

"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 € had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50€ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40€."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!

we just ate a pancake/waffle on their quite nice terrace (full of noisy kids but i didnt mind that da 
"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
when we visit sluis we love to stop there for a crepe. good and fast service. they show beautiful plates with exotic fruits but the fruit is not always good ... too bad they do not have a terrace . which we prefer in the summer.. 
nice place with air conditionning but some areas should definitely be cleaned.   ice cream but no lactose-free once.
"i wanted to have a famous pancake,but it ended up in a big dissolution.. hot plate but still cold pancake the pancake was stuck to my plate and didn’t taste of much the “freshly “ made marmalade is good when enjoy strawberries jam "

my family and i stopped here a couple of days ago for waffles.the waffles were good but nothing special. the waffles were 12 euros with fresh fruit and ice cream. the young male server that waited on us was rude and expressed his frustration with our inability to understand the menu which was in dutch and german.
i wanted a waffle with strawberries and my wife a small fruit salad. they brought a whole contraption of fruits... nothing special other than the presentation and they charged 12 euros a plate. on the menu wasnt even liste 
me and my family orderd a simple dish. we waited in total of a 90 minutes on our food. the food was good but service is terrible. also a (tip for the owner) hire more waiters from dutch origin. many couldnt understand us beaucause they didnt speak the local language.
terrible service sat there about 50 minutes after asking for a radler beer had to point to the drink i wanted on the menu as the person serving could not understand dutch or english waited and waited but no drink left after 50 minutes never again need more staff and ones who understand dutch or english
we went in for a quick lunch on what was possibly one of the busiest days of the year. it took them 1 hour and 15 minutes to serve my first bite! they didnt even put bread on the table to nibble on! food was so-so. nothing special. the waiters were very nice and doing what they could. i think the problem is in the bar and kitch 
"although the speed of service was not the best , the setting and decor was good and the outside terrace was excellent for a summer day.very child friendly. our meals were seafood (mosselen&sole) and were very tasty."
"we tried paling and mosselen. very good mussels, eel was a bit less: too soft. its a pity they dont contract an extra waiter, specially during nice summer days when terrace is full of waiting people..."
"this is a nicely located reataurant with a large dining area in the garden at the rear which we used and it was very pleasant. however, service was very slow even though the place wasnt very busy. my starter of prawns and mushrooms in garlic was excellent but we had problems with our steak mains. my wife will not eat meat which is even faintly pink so we asked for it to be medium to well done. when it arrived it was raw in the middle and dripping with blood so it was sent back. when it reappeared there was very little difference so, rather than labour the point, she just left it. im not a fussy as my wife but my own steak was too bloody for my liking, even after it, too, was sent back. we were then treated to a lecture by the rather condescending waiter on how steak should be cooked and what you should ask f "
sluis a place with a lot of tourists also in all the restaurants and cafes.the frietstal is known for many years in sluis for the friendly hospitallity and good food
the comments on trip advisor for this restaurant are mixed and that is what we found . we found the mix of quality for the food ranged between slop and average and based on our experience we would not go back
"during our trip to bruges, we stayed in a hotel in sluis, and decided to have our last evening meal in sluis itself, so we could walk back to the hot "
"we called today for lunch, a family of 7. the drinks were ordered quickly an efficiently, then the food order was taken. the food was duly served, but we didnt recognise some of the order, but we were rudely told that it was what we had ordered. then another waiter brought our order. turned out that the first had been delivered to the wrong able. this of course was our fault, with the lady behind the counter being so rude towards us through the waiters. we will definitely never be returning to this place."
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"late afternoon 4 pm ish, called for our early evening meal. it was empty which should have rang alarm bells but we just put it down to the hour. service was indifferent. slow to arrive with the drinks despite there being no one else there. ordered 2 x half chickens and ribs + chips. of the 2 chickens, 1 was ok but the other was still breathing, no well not quite, but when i cut into it it was still bleeding. i immediately told the waitress who wasnt in the least bit apologetic, simply took it away. now any descent restaurant would have started again with fresh produce. not this one. when i got my plate back, it was the same chicken. this time i think nuked whereas at first it was obviously deep fried due to the amount of oil it was sitting in. the ribs were very dry and quite tasteless. only saving grace was the chips which were good. would i go again. no chance."
"with our family from germany (4 persons) we visited sluis and wanted to have a light lunch in de corner: 1 soup, 1 saled and a shared portion of musse "
"we visited zeeuws vlaanderen for a weekend. were dutch and the zeeland province is our birthground. sluis is a transformed little city with no charm at all. its a an allover moneymaking area and this restaurant was an important part of pur dissappointment. we had an 2-scope icecream with a kind of spraycream and an espressocoffee for around 15 euro! the espresso was good... the icecream was not. in sluis you can get a parkingplace...youd have tompay the fee for an entire day ... even if you want to visit the supermarket. for us no problem, we domnot need to stay there, but imagening people being on holiday with the family... they dont say no , they wont spoil the day! they should say no.. because theyre ripped off and seated on that terrace i felt ashame to be a dutch national"
"we ordered the pancakes with tea for €4,50. unfortunately the pancakes are small and nothing special. one of them didnt seem to be baked properly either. wouldnt come back for dessert."
"a sign outside promoted paling in het groen for €23,5. inside the menu stated €24,5 "
we ordered a normal round of drinks at this restaurant and then asked for glasses of water as well at the same time. when four bottles of water arrived with our other drinks and we said we had wanted tap water we were then told we dont do tap water. this hadnt been told to us when we ordered. we then proceeded to wait 45min for toasted sandwiches one of which was burnt. an unfortunate experience. 
"last week-end we (2) went to this place for the second time. sunny day, lots of people outside, and inside. we were here already once and had a salade niçoise which was really ok. we even recommended the place a couple of months ago to friends who did complain about the poor quality. we were surprised. but last sunday (07/04/2013) we understood hem. although the place is clean, we had poor food quality (i had asian spareribs where 1/3 were barely grilled and still pink inside.) my partners white wine had a cork taste and the waitress told us this was impossible because it came from a carton container ( we have a serious wine experience and know when there is a cork smell/taste). she was quite blunt. the scampi from my partner were small and without taste, too much cream that was too liquid. my rosé wine was ok (at last). we decided to pay the bill and go. when going to the mens toilet i had the very awful experience to discover the toilet left full of excrements on the seat (yes i am not joking). i understand that its not he owners fault but when i did reported this to the waitress, i had a very grumpy answer instead of something like oh were sorry sir, well check this immediately and thank you for reporting it. never again!"
we went there based on the positive previous reviews but left disappointed. the atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly but the food was just not good enough. the fish stew was overcooked and the pasta was dripping in oil.
"poor experience… fish far too cooked, cesar salad with big chunk of chicken impossible to chew because they were too cooked as well. never again…"
spare ribs were ok but not perfect. service was polite. people from inside came on terrace to smoke  despite our 2 small kids and the food.
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said “5 more minutes” which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked good…"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant 🍴 is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish 🐟 soup 🍲, but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries 🍟 are ok 👌, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesn’t really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesn’t has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"
"the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is nice. we got a free amuse. our soup was also a good starter. however, our meat brochette was a bit of a let down. the meat was just tough. maybe we just had bad luck, looking at all the very positive reviews. still had a nice evening!"
"we ended up indoors on a beautiful day as the wasps were everywhere!! this was a shame as it’s location is beautiful on the side of the river. one did still manage to find us indoors, but this was better than the dozens crawling in our drinks and over the tables outsi "
"i had a grill burger: the bread was as twice as big as the patty, nothing special (only some ketchup and one leaf of lettuce.. and thats it "
i was visiting the area of sluis and decided to have a small snack at the mill of the villa 
"we went here many times before but now they have started a new process for ordering and it is no longer very nice. you now need to take your table number and order at one of the two kiosks entering in your mobile so you can receive a sms when your drinks are ready. i appreciate the use of technology but for a nice restaurant, i wish they would have kept it traditiona "
"this restaurant looks nice from the outside (it’s an old windmill) and the interior is cozy, especially the part in the historical building. we were sitting for less than a minute when the waitress came to take our order (good points for speed you should think), because we even hadn’t even had the time to open the menu. we may as well not have done that, because we had to wait for a long time for her to come back. when we finally could place our order, she indicated we can only have drinks in this part of the building, and had to move to the other side of the restaurant. when we did, we again waited for half an hour to place our order. the waiter was impolite and inattentive, the food and hot drinks were so-so and over-priced. you can find cheaper and better in sluis, the historical building is not a wild card to charge high prices for bad food and slow and impolite service, plus rigid rules about where what could be consumed."
"the place is pleasant, but the food is so so. the service is not so bad. it is only an option, if you meet the place and do not like to go far."
"its interesting to see the windmill, we went inside the shop next to the restaurant.  we made a decision to go to the restaurant because of the location, quite unique, modern interior in an old windmill"
"we went to this restaurant yesterday as it had shade and we were all boiling. big mistake ! the service was unfriendly , the food was small, burnt and tasteless and over priced . shocking !"
this restaurant in typical style is situated on the marketsquare of sluis opposite the belltower ( with tourist office : vv 
terrible service . arrogant behavior of the management. the french fries were under any standard. the mussels were not hot enough... the whole atmosphere was old fashioned . a real deceiving experience. no value at all for mon 
nice cozy place to have some food. local fish or mussels are of course mandatory when eating at the coast.
"in this friendly little tourist town,we came accross this cosy restaurant amongst the well preserved historic surrounding buildings.very friendly service without being pushy.we ate seafood-mussels and a mixed seafood dish,that were well prepared and tasty.a lovely house wine and a reasonable bill.what more can you ask for?"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"the restaurant is alright but it was def not meant for people who unable to speak dutch. i understand not having an english menu, but the wait staff who seemed competent enough were not willing to help out some foreigners understanding the menu, or speaking english after we ordered and made it clear that was all we could do. shame cause we probs would have ordered more food and drink! at least we def would have tipped more for the effort. "
"visiting sluis, a lively little town, we arrived midday and it drizzled. we found a parking spot immediately opposite this restaurant and chose an outdoor table on the covered terrace. the service was quick and correct, but their heart wasnt in  "
the manager is incredibly rude and the food just wasn’t that good. this country is filled with so many lovely people and you don’t need to go out of your way to be treated badly. eat elsewhere.
"the place is located somewhere in a nice middle of nowhere, in zeeland, close to the belgian border. without a gps you will never find i "
"when we made the reservation we relied on the 4 to 5 dots on tripadvisor, sounds like a safe bet. however, 4 to 5 dots are in my opinion overrated. i always try to look at positive elements but this could really be better. the positive side: waiters and waitresses work hard and really do their best. but they should have more people around as they were understaffed in my opinion. the menu could use more fantasy. putting butter in plastic cups on the table is something you would expect in a cantina or restaurant along the road - this is not a good idea. the crevette salad could have more attention: it felt like a very quick fix. i also do not understand that you put 75 eurocent on the menu for mayonaise. i expect that to be included. taste of the courses we ordered: we have seen better. also taking into account pricing is not quite on the cheap side (that is an understatement). i encourage the restaurant to put more effort in menu and courses for such prices."
"now the restaurant is called “le petit paris”, worst experience ever. the fish was overcooked and the chicken from cesar salad was unchewable :-("
this restaurant came recommended to us by someone in the family who had visited it over a year before. im not sure if things have drastically changed or if we came on a very unlucky day but this was one of the most infuriating and disappointing meals weve had in a long ti 
"the food was terrible. we ordered some tagliatelle with shrimps and salmon and it was just boiled pasta and boiled shrimps and salmon also boiled, all in a sauce of curry. no taste, nothing"
"went here for lunch, great welcome, kind staff. was looking forward to the “angus burger with cheddar cheese etc "
"popped into this restaurant for the first time, and we were extremely disappointed, we ordered a starter, and a main, everything started off very well, we were served an amuse bouche, then our starter of scampi and salmon arrived scampi ok a bit tasteless , we then had to wait 45 minutes for our main course, which were oysters for my wife, and cod for me, when eventually it arrived we could see that my dish of cod had been left under and probably forgotten some sort of heating to keep it warm, on top of that it had no taste, and wasnt worth the wait, our carafe of wine was very mediocre the service was pretty slow,mind you they were pretty quick to clear our plates away, compared to other places weve eaten in sluis, this place was very little value for money."
"nice pasta and salad , good service. good place for a quick lunch while visiting sluis.  not that expensive for the quality you get"
"you can not fault the restaurants location on the quay in sluis, very good outside terrace, if a little crammed in. the menu is quite extensive but i found it a little overpriced, especially the soft drinks. the food quality is good howev "
ordered 4 portions of mussels @20 euros plus one salade nicoi 
"a very busy restaurant. but it ranks in the all form no function scale. the thai curry took 45 minutes. once delivered a few of the pieces of chicken were raw. no one asked about the obviously raw pieces carefully moved out of the center of the bowl. the bill for the raw chicken, one water and one wine was 28€. praying i don’t also pay with illness later today.

"we visited sluis yesterday, it was around half past one when we arrived and looked for a place to eat. this place looked nice (and it is). my wife ordered pea soup (not snert, which is a very heavy pea puree soup), i ordered a saté. we both had a glass of wat "
"we regularly have lunch in this restaurant. many people here are regular guests. i took the oven baked fish with wine sauce, it excelled in being tasteless. my wife took the flemish stew and enjoyed it a lot. depending on what you take you will enjoy it more or less. the service is always very friendly."
"not quite sure if they have a shortage of menu cards, but when we asked for one, we were told to ask the people at another table for one!! the restaurant was almost full inside and very hot and smelt very fishy, so outside it was, luckily it warmed up and it was pleasant to sit there.when we finally got hold of a menu, and ordered, the food was good. my husband had lasagne, my friend, scampi in garlic butter, and mine was a delicious goat cheese salad. the food was very good, the service a bit less, but maybe they just had too much work. we intended staying for dessert, and once again asked for a menu, as there were none around, but that did seem to be a problem, so when no menu arrived, we decided just to get the bill instead and left."
"we were looking precisely for a good italian resto in sluis and mineral had best marks on tripadvisor. it looked pretty good at the beginning and was full of people (most ordering pizza). in fact, we got self made sparkling water (6,5 euro/bottle.. ); tomato soup was a disaster (too hot, with too much salt and huge pieces of tomatoes - obviously from cane); pasta was ok (i would give 6 points from 10); but service made it all.. young lady who served us was tired and definitely not interested in tips, she simply picked the order, delivered food without any word, ignored coffee and bill (though she confirmed the order, we never received our espresso and i had to go to the bar to pay dinner myself). nothing to be added, we will not come back. "
first vist to sluis for me for 20 years. never bothered to go back as it was just very small with lace and porn sho 
"have visited this eatery previously & has always been ok. however, on a recent visit to sluis me & my husband decided to have lunch here, now they welcome people from uk but do not have an english menu which i find ignorant & not very keen to explain their menu. that said we selected a tuna baguette each & a beer & diet coke. as we don’t speak dutch, we failed to notice a sur charge on all baguettes of 1.50 euros on top of the price of a standard roll. this took our total bill to 26 euros!!! really for 2 blooming rolls & 2 drinks i’m sorry this is a real rip off & we will never be going back. we did approach the waitress who conveniently said we should have asked: we did & she chose to not understand us. what a rip off!!! avoid as very expensive without sur charges for baguettes."
"we stayed at de lingehoeve for three nights and ate in the restaurant once. ive described it as interesting because it could be very good but lets itself down by things that you think might be easily rectified. for example: (1) our room had no discernible number and no key, so we couldnt lock our door from the outside. once we came back to find the door ajar! (2) they didnt serve breakfast on a monday morning before 9 am! (they did eventually agree to leave us a tray out, and the breakfast itself was good.) (3) there were coffee and tea-making facilities in the room but no coffee or tea! (4) on the sunday, although no one made up our room, they did leave us some clean towels (but left the dirty ones!). (5) the lounge has great antique furniture but none of it was polished, or even dusted. (6) the food, which was all a surprise(!), was well cooked and well presented, but both the tuna and duck were almost raw, which is not to everyones taste and sending back food is always disruptiv "
"bad service, bad info, burned bitterballen .... something so simple and not bring able to do that at a normal (basic) level of quality is reason to reconsider whether you should be open for business, accepting people’s money ..."
"never in my life have i been treated this badly in a restaurant or cafe and i have been to many. the main waitress offended me when i asked after 20 minutes if my order came through than, after 40 minutes in total., still nothing while she looked at our table often. i told her and she just shrugged her shoulders. not even a sorry or surprised look...."
"terrible customer service, careless attention to quality and taste of food served. i ordered an apple tart with nuts. it was served super cold, not really able to taste anything given the serving temperature. when asked to warm up, i was told they had no time to do so. ambiance / space is nice but that is it! "
sorry but it was really not oke. first i was told to order direct because i could only have breakfast untill 11.00 but i was there at 10.35. then i orderded pancakes. this was really bad. they were very dry and hard with a spoon of jam on it. it looked and tasted like nothing. for 10 euro 
"the restaurant is in old greenhouses just outside leiden. visited on a sunday at lunchtime. its very family friendly,  so lots of kids. the food was good if not a little pricey. service was mixed but friendly enough."
"we were given a table in a very noisy place, next to the bar with a very high traffic, people, waitresses passing by, sounds of dishes glasses etc while there were other tables available. the table was not clean, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. it took really long between serving the drinks and ordering food. the food was not warm enough while it was served and the quality vs price was pretty law. i had a feeling i came to a come-eat-go place. poor hospitality."
"cannot comment on food as i could not taste it but found the behaviour of waitress extremely rude. i had been there with my 7 year old son to celebrate fathers day and had requested for a table for two. we were flatly declined and were asked to pick up something from the takeaway joint nearby. the waitress didnot even bother to suggest on a waiting time incase we wanted to wait. i could see lots of couples after us being escorted in who also didnot have any reservations hence could not really fathom the behaviour. in my so many years of stay in netherlands have not come across such a behaviour, may be waitress was having a bad day. stay blessed."
"beautiful view on a sunny day, very nicely designed space, love hanging plan "

"the food was nice (although a bit too garlicy), but the service could be much much better. they served us beer in a cracked glass, there was a hair in my plate and it was full of spider webs..."
"i had dinner here last night. the starters were good (a.o. the bieterbal), but the tuna steks were overcooked and not warm! (we specifically asked this before ordering). then they brought us the halibut dish and a quinoa burger. not very much flavour on both. so this was an average experience. great service and good espressos."
"nice location, friendly stuff, food bad. the meat was chewy, bland and for the quality too expansive. i would  not eat here a second time."
"i was refused service here on two occasions. let me elaborate. the first time i visited brasserie buitenhuis, it was about mid day i walked about 1 kilometer from my hotel and upon arrival i explained that my family had flown in earlier that day to leiden via amsterdam schiphol and was jet lagged. as a result i wanted like to get some take away food to carry for them. the man in charge explained that the dont do take away. understanding that some eateries dont do take away i simply left without any foo "

"went here for a simple lunch on a sunday. the service was terrible. we ordered snacks, and they came after 40 min. no warning that the wait was going to be long. no sorry for the delay. another 20 min to get cold wraps. the food was ok, but at that point, we just wanted to go. one more thing;the chicken wrap was way too spicy"
"ordered “kip pikant” at the office we noticed that the chicken was smelling strange (sour)... we returned to the shop and complained. no real excuse was given, only some other sandwiches were given in return "

"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."
"we had some bites in the afternoon : they were ok and although we had to wait very long, we got a very good service from one pers "
"went here for a 5-course dinner on a saturday evening, we came in early and were welcomed very friendly. the table was nicely setup, clean and spacious setup of the tables and (i love it) an open kitchen. first we were asked if we wanted and appetizer drink (which we agreed on), we took a white port and a cocktail. port tasted good, sweet but not too sweet for a pre-dinner drink. cocktail was tasty also and not too alcoholic. we sat for a good 4 hours, starting with an appetizer (4 actually), bread+oil+butter&sea-salt and then all courses came. some we had to wait for other tables to catch up with us as they prepared most as they could at once. without going to details into the food it was in one word: fabulous. you get really good value for what you pay, for real. but there is a catch, several in fact, which will keep this restaurant from earning (or being eligible to earn) a real dutch michelin guide star. that being: the girls werent all dressed as it should, although they wore the same dress, one had white shoes under them, other black. also the restaurant is shared with the brasserie, and you see (as they share the kitchen) a lot of movement between the two which can be disturbing. also (even before the busy part) one of the girls left leaving essentially one girl (with sometimes help of second one) to serve all tables, resulting in the chef serving dinner for some courses). also the toilets (and paths to them) werent in match what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. not the cleanest, empty (supermarket style) soap and you could just walk out on the backside and into the (dishwasher part) of the kitchen. that area could use a re-style. but, as food is the most important thing in a restaurant, next to the service (which was, dont get me wrong, good) i do give this place a good review, also because the price really values the experience. so, for a great evening out i would highly recommend this place."

"waited one hour for salads and 12 uurtje lunch which is a simple combination of typical dutch food elements,easy to cook. incredible. it was ok taste but obviously nobody cares anymore if you have to wait one hour. juice not fresh.  not."
"we arrived at noon in plenty of time for the flower parade and got served drinks fairly quickly but our order of 3 tostis, 2 roast beef sandwiches and 1 smoke salmon and prawn sandwiches did not arrive despite frequently hailing a server. eventually at 1 o.clock the tostis arrived they looked pretty insipid and seemed like dried bread rather than toasted bread. after more complaints we eventually got one of the roast beef sandwiches at 1.15. finally we left at 1.30 still without food for 2 of our party. we just left the money on the table because we didnt even get the bill but we had to go to take our seats. go there if you dont mind waiting for hours."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."

"good food for a good price. nothing fancy or special but always a good place to have a meal with family or friends. the beeren restaurant in roosendaal is similar in quality to the other beren restaurants. although this one is a bit bigger than most ive visit, more spacious. staff is friendly."
a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"
"i visited the singraven estate with friends. we had a light lunch at this restaurant - pancakes. a very nice setting, with good quality food and reasonable prices."
the restaurant is very nice located in an ols water mill in a beautiful suurounding. the food is not bad but gives the idea that they did not change for at least twenty five years
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."

excellent meat...no question about it....you can order it in any weight you might want and they show you the pieces almost like in a butchershop:what you see is indeed what you get 
"this restaurant and party centre looks and feels upper class and their dishes also provide that impression. the food is pretty good but not that good. and what should make it complete - efficient staff, cozy atmosphere etc - are not upper class. certainly a nice place but not as advertised. "
"as described in several reviews here: this restaurant has been part of conspiracy-theories for years. they actively discourage vaccines, making the whole place unsanitary. there is a lot of propaganda to throw away face masks etc. i used to love to go here in the past, but its become a temple of doom."
"i made a reservation for my mother and a group of her friends for her 75th birthday. the event manager was aware that it was a special day and we specifically requested a table in the restaurant, not one of the separate rooms because they were too large and unsuitable (which the event manager agreed). literally 48 hours in advance, they cancelled the reservation because they had taken on a larger group (funeral). my mother was offered one of the separate rooms which we previously agreed upon were unsuitable for the occassion (too large and too business like). it seems a friendly, organic place, but in the end it is all about the money. do not be fooled."
"the first “cool” day in weeks, but just comfortable enough to start our dinner outside on the terrace of this very nice situated restaurant. the “spitskool kroketjes” had little “spitskool” and a lot of “roux” in them and were not crunchy, but there was a nice salad on the plate. then my main course. instead of a quiche with some salad on the side what i had expected what i got was a huge plate of salad with the same ingredients i had in my starter salad and on the edge of the plate 6 or 7 cubes of very tasty quiche, but not half enough. i didn’t want that whole plate of greens. the proportions in that quiche plate were all wrong. my friend enjoyed her “rundvlees met ratatouille”. being the only guests outside they seemed to forget us and we went in to have a coffee. and still no-one asked us whether we enjoyed our meal, whether we would like a dessert. inexperienced personnel? just bad luck? not an evening that triggers you to come back!"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
"the location is beautifull, the reataurant is very cosy. unfortunately the menu is quit limited. there;s not that much to chose for. we ordered a salade for staters. the waitress told us that the salade was quit big for one person. so we split it and that was a good idea. the salade was big, tasty and looking good. we had the goat chesse salde. i can recommendit to y "

more occupied of speed and sales than of the wellbeing of the customers. nice location but a litte cheap(ish)
"we went there because it was near to our holiday home and there were not many restaurants open that day. place is big but still feels cramped. food was very poor. io had a duck breast without any taste. it was served on an undefined kind of mashed potatoes that had no taste itself, but it was drowned in some gravy, of which i suspect it was just made of granules. next time when im in the neighborhood i will take a longer drive to find a decent for a dinner."

the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at €1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."

"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldn’t be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when it’s busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a ‘broodje haring’ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"stopped here via boat for a drink and snack. beautiful view of lake and nice deck, but very slow and inattentive service. at the slow pace of service ran out of time to even order food..."
"together with a friend we had a nice stay, thanks to the great location and the nice, friendly services. the dishes on menu card are very average, probably still going strong (as most restaurants have), not a single surprise. we both chose for the spare ribs (3 half pieces p.p., but more than enough) with two sauces and some pommes frites, but nothing else served with it... the spare ribs were average of quality of meat, but tasteful (we give it the benefit of the doubt), the sauces (bbq and aioli) were good of taste (however do not kiss your partner afterwards...), but probably not fresh made. as a dessert we had the ananas panna cotta and the - old fashioned - dame blanche 2.0, both creative presented and very tasteful. the espresso and the cappuccino afterwards were of good quality."

"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
i have eaten here with my sisters wedding. i didnt think they did anything special for her. the menu was boring and didnt tast great.
"we visited this restaurant after quite some time for dinner again. the 4-course menu was good, food was delicious. but the service can be improve "
"because the restaurant has a michelin star we had high expectations. the food was ok, nicely presented, the service is very good and friendly. but the chef is super conservative when it comes to flavors, i just expected more."
very disappointed as reputation was so good. not a lot of taste. mismatch in taste. the only good dish was the duck. where does the star come from?
on may 30th had a 6 course dinner in this restaura 
"small restaurant with bad acoustics and really bad chairs. but we proceeded, against our first impression. it took them 35 minutes to get us three plates with “tapas”. shrimps were still cold and watery from the fridge, the carpaccio was watery, the french frites were raw. the spare ribs in two small bowls were not bad. woth five we received a small bread, two slices per person. we asked to taste the “wine” and was denied. bad tasting wine at a price of € 6,50 per glass, ridiculous price for wine from the lidle. the salmon was really bad, out of the fridge. we had to pay to much, they wouldn’t argue but in the end we received €30 back. still we payed way to much for bad prepared food."
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as it’s very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"it took quite some time before anybody took our order for some drinks. it took even longer to bring us the menu, furthermore we tried to order some more drinks but nobody was paying attention to us, although the restaurant itself is quite small. the starter didnt match the description of the menu so that was a dissapointment, staff had no real explanation for this. the main course chicken on a skewer was undercooked so by that time i was done. they served the plates out one at the time so by the time the last person of our group had his dinner the first dishes were cold. they forgot to bring my dessert so i was done for. too bad since my previous dining experience here was much better...."
"so hard to resist the apple pie and when we were cycling past the menu board at lely, we had to stop! morning tea time anyway! lovely al fresco area in an open town square,with plenty of seating, very attractive flower baskets and pots, added to the atmosphere. friendly staff too all made for a pleasant interlude, and glad we stopped here."
"never actually leave any reviews but felt like i had to as this restaurant clearly does not deserve the status they claim to have. reserved a table at 20:00, because they are working in shifts but then it appears they don’t as a long line was waiting for a table (where they made a reservation for) but which wasn’t free/ ready. very unprofessional service, when we joined friends of ours at another table and actually in that way solved the staff their problem they asked us ‘to check the bill ourself and arrange this ourself’ this was very rude. young, unprofessional staff who clearly don’t have any experience in hospitality related businesses. food was ok, but don’t ask for these high prices when your service is this poor"
it a local restaurant trip advisor describe it as one of the best places in the area i beg to differ food is reasonable nothing exciting service could improve  the waiter did not know whats campari orange. the location good reasonably priced
"too expensive for very average food in a worn out ambiance, poor unprofessional service and a long wait. the nearby ara hotel restaurant is a much better option."
"what used to be a good (always overpriced) place, turned into worse. waiter not interested for his guests, waiting too long to get ordered bread. my “tompouce” of asperges and smoked salmon was very bad. the crust was soft lile a sponge. even mentioning this was a confirmation at nothing more. ordered different ways of preparing our two soles, but when it was served theydid not have any clue. the asperges on a side where overcooked and too much lemon used. and than the price still overprized"
"i havent been there for a while. so to me it came as a surprises that the interior as been changed into a trendy restaurant look and feel. but thats the only change. still the same smooth service, delicious white wine and a lobster. main courses are mostly around the 25 eu "
"restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a nice retro style before, but after a change in ownership it has become quite dull without any real decorations. i came to waal with my girlfriend quite early so there were barely any people. we wanted to sit next to the windows, however the waitress told us it was impossible because the seat was reserved for people with a dog. i could understand it for one of the seats, but there were a total of five seats still vacant! finally the waitress gave us a seat in the back of the restaurant, even though the place was almost empty! after asking a waiter if we could change seats to a seat near the window he told us it was no problem and was also amazed the girl said it was not possible. after we changed seats the waitress who showed us the seat in the first place was talking with other waitresses and all of a sudden they all looked our way! not a comfortable feeling. as a starter we ordered a carpaccio which was absolutely delicious. for the main course i ordered the pasta pesto and my partner ordered the half lobster with soup. my pasta was not great, but also not bad. the lobster itself was great, but the soup we got in the first place was quite sour. we were told in the first place that we could have as much soup as we wanted. at first a waitress, who seemed to be a new worker, came to us with a small pot with the soup inside. when my partner asked to give us a bowl to fill with soup instead of pouring it on a plate with rice a more senior waitress came and reacted very strong and unfriendly that we could have a bowl once we finished this plate. after the first bowl a friendly older waiter came to us with more soup and also offered to put some liquor in the soup, why the waitress didnt offer this in the first place is unclear... because my partner liked the soup she wanted another bowl, however the waitress said it was not possible because they were out of soup(?!) it was still early so we knew this was very strange, finally the woman said it was not that they were out but the last bit in the pot was not edible so they wouldnt give us, even though we could see last time the waiter came there was still plenty of soup in the pot. after confronting the waitress she said that if we wanted more we had to order a soup for 10 euro!!! in the end she gave in and gave us another lobster soup, however this one was much more delicious than the one offered together with the lobste "

"... would have liked to be informed upfront that we would not be sitting in the actual restaurant but one of the (albeit nice) other rooms in the castle. it was very noisy and the music could hardly be heard, albeit at some stage it was put louder but with music that had nothing to do with christmas. service was friendly but not always efficient and we needed to explain about our special request three times and still the wrong cutlery and courses were put on the table. the food was high quality as was the wine. and again, location location location. could have been very good but because of the flaws not sure i would book again next year."

"went into this restaurant with my family for a lunch time snack feeling a little hungry and left 1 hour and 15 mins later very hungry. a very busy lunch time all tables occupied with one chef and one waitress, talk about throwing away business left right and centre. cant rate the food because they forgot to write down our order. good idea for the management to call reimers and herman."
nice eetcafé with good beers. excellent food but pricy. assertive waitress with quick servings. portions right size for all of us.
"ma moeder is located in the middle of the buzy shopping streets of hoogvliet. on a sunny saturday, which is just inviting for a lunch outside we selected ma moeder as our destination. menu card is not excessive, so with few dishes on the card, we expected good food as well. we selected a dutch delicatese kroket sandwich, however never have i seen such a sad dutch lunch before. kroket was warm and crisp (from the friture) - like we expected, but bun was cold. no butter was served along with the sandwish - only a small tube of mustard, which didnt even cover half the bun. no decoration on plate and anything elsewhich gives you are feel good experience. staff dressed in cargo pants and jeans shirt, so in my eyes not really presentable at a restaurant eith "
we heard about the green star from michelin en where excited to try this restaurant. we love vegetarian food and also loved the idea of 80/20 vegatables/mea 
"this dutch style restaurant and pub is situated at at key bridge over the slood, and enjoys the waterside views of a canal barge stopping point for the occupants and other visitor "
the restaurant is in the small town of wateringen. opposite church and notary monument office. pleasant street. has a terrace with tables and inside space. the waiters are good. food is good quality. good beers on offer . fresh ingredients and interesting menu of the chef. wait to be seated little slow. for the rest ok. 
scrumpy is a dominant and very popular sport in the middle of wateringen right across the old town hall. the terrace is popular and it is a nice place to relax after some hours shopping or just to have a nice drink. many different beers are offered and scrumpy is a popular meeting place for friends. the offered meals are

"pleasant outside seating area. slow service, despite screen camera showing outside being available to internal staff. good service and value for money. negative in that whilst near the end of our coffee the staff stood and waited for us to finish, ie. it felt that you were being rushed."

"nice outdoor seating  and historic building. but:  (plastic)  menu extremely simple and limited, way overpriced (e.g. €20 burger, €18 for one satey skewer), very small portions and food badly (mostly under) cooked."
"we each had the4 course for €32,50 eachplus a €39 bottle of pinot noir. wine wastasty, service was pretty good, for a dutch restaurant. food was nice, the gazpacho soup was heavy on the garlic, but as long as you both have it, eh? our mains were steaks and they didnt ask what temp we would like, they were cooked a decent medium, but i prefer rare so that wasslightly disappointing. however, value for money it was quite nice. presentation was nice. staff is friendly. "
"after a nice round of golf we had a so called borrel with good wine and some little bites. all quite good. we decided to stay for dinner . most of us had fish the plaice was iffy and two of us had the driest kibbelingen. fried cod ,we ever had in our life. the latter was for me more a one than a three "
"the atmosphere is good, service ok but the food edible but not exceptional. wine was outstanding, the best surprise of the evening. seems to me that when it is warm, the terrace outside recommended."
"i’m disappointed to be writing this review, because the location is great and the restaurant has potentia "
service extremely slow. we had to call the waitress several times to order. a pity since the place has a nice decoration.
"we did a family dinner here. the location is nice and it offers a really nice playground for the kids. but the establishment is targeting the trendy upscale crows and you can tell walking in. its all there but it lacks a welcome atmosphere. staff is nice and helpful but the food was average. i ordered a tournedo and it was tender but a little too rare for liking. the chicken with mango chutney was nicely presented but flat in taste. and the tuna steak was too salty. so all in all, nice presentation but average on food. "
"don’t order here! at mother’s day my husband and my daughter tried to make me a surprise ordering a nice breakfast! it was not delivery, no one answered phone, emails or whatsapp! the site confirmed and sent a confirmation email and even with that they didn’t show up! very disappointed! "
"we had a lunch with family and, the lunch card is ok and everyone found something. the sandwich portions are proper but the (more expensive) other meal not a lot. the quality of the food was  "
"cote du bouef was most expensive dish, had 60% fat, three staff members came to review. no sympathy, that is the way it should be. the chimicurru sauce was not fresh, did taste bad. 1st and last time for me. total dissapointment. "
beautiful location close to the lake however service is too slow and lengthy despite of the very basic and simple menu list. not sure if we want to come back.
opening hours not accurate. it states this restaurant is open to 21:45. we arrived around 20:40 and they said they were closed. very disappointing but on the positive side we then stumbled across groucho’s which was amazing and serves food till late! we arrived well after 21:00 and made very welcome by all staff. we’ll be back!

"we had lunch after a walk in the area, since it was sunny we where the terrace while the kids played in the play area. the food was ok, nothing special. fora couple with kids this is a good place to go."

"i cycled passed the place earlier that day, decided would try it, family visit staff while serving drinks were initially fine but we waited over 1 1/2hours for mains, chased food staff started to come ignore and concentrate efforts on locals, 3 out of 6 mains came had to send back other 3 as we were ready to leave, food was below standard for the pri "

"nice atmosphere, food/drink was good, service was moderate, table reservation was not taken seriously."
boss is a bit loud with a faux friendly attitude. fake. my waitress was fairly welcoming but the one handling the payment was rude. they asked to be paid cash. cheese salad was was nice though. mineral water was good too. overall a disappointing experience.
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice. "
we dicide to eat something. after 20min of waiting for service were go somewher else!!! and that was the best decision.  dont go there!   there was bot so many ppl. it wasnt rush hour...
we stopped here simply for drinks. saantje has a pleasant outside terrace area. the inside looks good to 
"the fries are alright, but i had to wait ages to get them. even though there were just a few customers and seven people working..."
"terrible service. our order wasn’t brought completely. bittergarnituur should be 16 pieces but we’ve got 12 pieces. the calamaris didn’t come at all. after saying our complaints 3 times they told us ‘i don’t know’, the other person said: ‘i will check for you’ and didn’t do anything at all. me and my friends will not come here in the future and i recommend you didn’t either."
"told them we had 50 minutes to eat, they said no problem. 45 minutes later they told us they can’t serve us and they have cancelled our order. skip this and go to san blas instead."
"the roast chicken and rose pinot grigio were nice. a coupe of service matters not so good. but seeing as erwin (at the bar) demonstrated that this place does actually value its customers, i’ll just put those down to random bad luck!"
"to the snack counter: one of the worst customer experiences ever. staff was continuously talking to each other. because of that pretty slow service and messing up the orders. the male chef was super charming to his female colleague while chatting. but he was very rude to the customers. these were already talking to each other, upset because of the poor service and even poorer treatment by the chef. horrible!"
"parnassia has a nice terrace. the menu looks okay, although on the pricey side. waiters asked us literally every minute if we had made our choice already, a bit too eager to my tast "
"modern beach club with a long history and beautiful terrace with view on the beach. the friendly waitress served us a average caesar salad (iceberg lettuce, chicken, cheese and dressing), we had better lunches this week."
the location is really beautiful at he top of a dune. perfect place for a sundowner. the service is pretty chaotic. there are many people running around but it is not always easy to get ones attention. the first two orders were sold out. my third choice was just ok. cleanliness in times of corona can also be better.
this place definitely needs competition. being in a monopolist position for ages at this location successive managers apparently never felt the need to provide their guests a better service (cheeky staff members) and value for money. enjoy the beach but spend your money elsewhere.
"this restaurant has one option for gluten/lactose intolerant person ( double checked with the manager), chicken breast. got them raw, not only once but twice(after sending them back)! before i was able to take a second zip from my drink the waiter took it. so no food and nothing to drink! i would recommend the beach for your dog but not this restaurant!"
"if its busy, service is slow. if it isnt, the place will be understaffed, and service is slow. its the only game in town, so tough luck."
the steak was alright and the sauce was great. but serving casino bread that feels stale or too little toasted is a crime against humanity. the food is not cheap and the bread which seems a very cheap and bad alternative takes away a lot from the experience. the same sauce with a proper homemade bread would have been amazing. sadly i cannot give any more points as i cannot forgive the mediocrity of the casino bread.
i’m sorry but this is absolutely unforgivable for me to see in a restaurant with this price range. store bread served with a 22 euro steak? no ma’am this is just u-n-f-o-g-i-v-a-b-l-e.
you just lost 4 loyal customers.... 4 people who have been coming here regularly for a number of years... we fully understand that most restaurants in the current situation do more seating slots to accommodate the approved number of customers... well .. at loetje you are given 1.5 hours.. that is ridiculous... this is not a pizza place but somewhere you go to enjoy a nice meal... we had starters and then had to wait 50 mins for our mains to arrive.. just as we barely finished we basically got kicked out as our slot was up. for a bill of 250 euro for 4 that is unacceptable and pure money making tactics .. every other restaurant in haarlem in this price range will give you 2 - 2.5 hours for your meal which is perfectly fine but 1.5 h is a complete joke ... don’t expect us or any of our friends back any time soon 
"we had lunch here on the very nice terrace. we ordered foccacia with smoked salmon, clubsandwich smoked salmon and clubsandwich pastrami and a meatbal on sliced bread. good value for money, although not too subtle. good cappuccino, nice dry chardonn "
"we live in overveen so go to loetje’s often but the last few times has not been very good, food was ok but the service was rubbish twice we had to go and ask for service, as they were just stood talking not good for new visitors "

my wife and i celebrated my birthday at loetje overveen. we come here often and the steaks are steady in taste. my favourite meal on the menu: de biefstuk ossenhaas(tenderloin) bali with lots of sauce (a chili hot sauc 
"we stopped for a coffebreak at this restaurant. it was a quiet weekdag morning, so only about 10 - 20 other guests were there. after ordering, nothing happened. when we asked about 15 minutes later, they went inside to check again. the response was that the order was completely forgotten about."
"had steak at loetje several times at several different locations. the steak is always great, good descent food. cant go wrong with steak and fries. service was disappointing last time around, no attention what so ever!"
"after a good visit in january we returned and stayed in the hotel for a short break in august. whilst the rooms were lovely, our holiday was ruined by the rude unhelpful restaurant staff. twice we were forgotten when ordering drinks and when i went to the bar to sort it out, i was completely humiliated. the girl behind the bar shouted over to a waitress who said our order was on its way. nearly 25 mins after ordering a drink i went back to the bar again and was shouted at by the waitress with shoulder length curly hair. hey miss mistakes happen!!! no apology. we had our wine and ate elsewhere. will not return or recommend."
"been here a few times now but i cant see the appeal. too busy, overpriced and having to order everything separately does not do it for me. i hear a lot of people positive about this location so you probably need to try yourself and judge (as with everything) but i wont be back. "
"my experience here was disappointing. i had tried loetje steaks at a food fair in amsterdam and had high expectations for this restaurant. not only the steak was disappointing (not very tasty and buried in butter / oil), but also the service was very very slow. the restaurant was only half full and we very served the main meal after more than 1 hour from the starter! i will not go back here."
"been a few times, but the last time was the last. 2 hours between drinks and main course, need i say more? horrible service and the food only so so. i hate giving negative reviews and never do. on top of waiting. they brought us the wrong dish and when a friend mentioned this the cook was incredible rude and arguative so much so that another cook came to apologise on his behalf. they said it was really busy because it was nice weather out, but then they should be prepared for busy times. food is only so so, tastes massed produced. there are better places around to eat including two places across the street. "
"we had dinner with friends here, had carpaccio and dutch new herring with toast as starters. it was good, it took like more then half an hour to get the empty plates off our table. inasked tontake the toast as well....the waiter said inwanted to leave that for thevsteak! i was like: ???. we ordered steaks, regular and xl ones. the regular were served very very well done even hard to chew on. ive never had that before to be honest. the solved it but the price is that you dont eat together, which i think is a bummer. the plates took forever to get taken away. it was busy in the restaurant but not grazy busy as it can be at restaurants of loetje. i sometime think that staff thinks  hey youre at loetje, you better know it i on the other hand think, well we pay your salary! the desserts, bonbons, coffee and afterdinner drinks were good. maybe i need a loetje break"
"all of the loetje restaurants are good, but it must be time to have the menus reviewed and updated, it would be nice to see more seasonal specials, as the food on offer becomes very limited, steak, liver, salad. please make this lovely restaurant worth more visits."
"loetje opens new restaurants like i change shoes. yesterday lunch with friends at loetje in overveen. 4 waitresses who excel in not having (eye)contact with the customer on an almost empty terrace. eventually we could order drinks and sandwiches. the tuna looked good, but the mozzarella on white bread was one soggy sponge. brr. crispness was certainly not the case so i wondered how old the sandwiches were. at least one day old."
"a nice vibe here, a large space thats hip and modern. decent service. the beer selection was adequate. i had the steak bali which was pretty tasty. a good experience."
"we made reservations a month ago. i found the service...not as a was used to, which is a bummer! had to ask for water twice. waiter spoiled wine while pooring it! ordered hollandse garnalen for starter, got the snack instead!!! ordered steak bali, got regular....came back whit a spoon of sambal smacked on it!! fries were way too salt. had to ask for wine again! i fou d it sad service this time! the steak and ordered salad was good! one of the plates with fries was really half fulled with mayonaise! redicilous! if i get this another time well have a discussion....for real!"
this chain is growing out of its comfortable origin in amsterdam it is clearly difficult to maintain the original standard in atmosphere.
"stopped here with friends coming back to ams from the beach. place is ok, quality of the steak was average. not that great, but at least service was nice."
"id booked a quiet table here on a monday night. walked in and am taken to a table in the middle of the restaurant, 2 inches from a table filled with very loud girls. naked light bulbs over our heads. i couldnt hear someone sitting opposite  "
"on the basis of excellent reviews of the steaks i tried here. the service was very average - after i arrived it took a long time before i was acknowledged or seated. they dont take advance reservations other than for parties of more than 6, which is irritating. the room was fine but quite casual and the acoustics were noisy - not the best choice for a business meeting. the steak, chips and salad was fine but not exceptional. menu entirely in dutch so you may struggle if you dont speak the language. all in all a good place for a casual meal with friends but not somewhere for something more formal or romantic."
"so my experience with dutch service hasnt exactly been the best, but my waitress at loetje was the worst i had in amsterdam. the pub was packed and with no reservations permitted we knew we might have a bit of a wait. and we did. but the bar staff were great at keeping us happ "

"we took the alliance four course menu. the portions are quite small and we found that not all the tastes came out of the different dishes being served. the waitress drowned my first course of north sea crab with the green herb dressing. there was little taste of the sole in the second course, although the truffle sauce was quite delicious. the third course was a bit of a disaster for my wife as she found buckshot in the hare. this was explained away as being risk of the trade. not something you would expect from a restaurant of this standard. the cheese trolley was excellent and with a glass of good port made up for what for us was quite a disappointing experience."
"we had diner with *dining with the stars* in this 2 star michelin restaurant. the service was ok. one girl was really friendly we sat out on the terras with a marvelous view. the sun protectings were white and very dirty, should me replaced immediately. the small tables should be vernised as the are ba "
dropped in for a short coffee break during my bike ride from zaandvort. ordered coffee and pie. didnt get my order for over 15 minutes. when someone came by to ask if everything is okay they told me that my order got screwed up with another table. they promised me i would get it now very soon. after again way over 10 minutes i was just about to leave when it finally arrived. now they said it had been ordered for the wrong table number. didnt seem very apologetic. pie was okay but nothing to write home about. coffee was too small for the price.
"on the only sunny day so far of our first dutch summer, we decided to take our family to the beach. after the cycle to bloemendaal aan zee, the sight of t eindpunt was irresistable; the views from the outdoor seating area were beautiful and the drinks on other guests tables looked very tempti "

t eindpunt is a good place to eat after a day at the beach. staff is friendly. food is ok and served quickly. pricing is average. dining outside is fine but be aware of the direction of the wind otherwise your fun will be ruined.
nice restaurant we have been going to for years. menu us ok and food quality is good. unfortunately not really good options for vegetarians nor for vegans. that is a bit if a shame as more and more people follow such diets.
"played here as a child, hiding in the hollow tree (now a bronze replica) and spending energy running up and down the dunes. now apple-speck pancakes for old times sake."
"visited middle of the heatwave and charged 3 euro for a jug of tap water - why you ask (?) because i was told the germans always ask for it - so what, it’s water from a tap and i had two thirsty children - nope, still 3 euros. quite unbelievable - have never paid for tap water anywhere. "
"if you are extremely hungry and looking for just a quick meal with nice pancakes and you are without children, you should no go here "
we were a party of 6 looking to eat a snack . . . . pancak 
"the location is good for a quick bite when you are heading to or from zandvoort. we tried several pancakes and i must say that their pancakes are average. some pancakes were ok but some were not that tasty, it misses something. but its good for a quick snack. "
"the location is great. it takes, however, very long to order and even longer to get what you ordered. the lemonade is good, the food is just ok, but not if you take the expensive prices into consideration. there are better places around."
"we wanted to eat something on the beach in bloomingdale and spontaneously went to the beach club. we were allowed to choose a table and from then on it was over with the service. everyone who came after us was served except us. only when my wife went to serve did someone come to our table. we were served reluctantly, probably because we are germans. no recommendation!!!"
"the food itself tasted fine, actually it was such a small portion that we need to go to the fastfood place around the corner to eat something else. unfortunately the prices say something different. "
"we went for drinks on a sunny busy afternoon. we were with 3 people and 3 more were joining quickly after, so we asked a 6 persons table. this was not possible because they only give tables to ‘full groups’?! when our 3 friends arrived there was a still a table next to us available so we asked personnel if our friends could sit there, which was agreed to. when they wanted to sit down, it was suddenly not possible anymore, because we were not a ‘full group’ from te beginning?! very rude and we left. 1 star is for the pornstar martini which was good. however i will drink my martini somewhere else next time. not recommend "
evening visit. noisy. busy. food average. service slow.   good location on beach and for families during the day might be better.   no return for me.
we were there on a day the weather was not very sunny and likely to rain so there were not many people. the service was quick and ok. prices are as expected near beach rather high.
"service was appalling. once we had eaten, plates were not cleared. neither were the tables around us. by the time we paid the table next to us had been piled with half eaten smelly leftovers for an hour. it actually made me sick. even specifically asking a waitress to clear our plates failed, she just took another table’s money and left never to retur "
"i waited about 20 min before asking the hostess how can i order. she said i had to wait for a waiter to come for my order. well, ok house rules. waited another 15mins counting how many waiters pass by me and on “5” i just left. "
what an amazing view. and there it stop

"we asked for an english menu, which came after 15 minutes; the waitress was rude, arrogant and helpless, she forgot the beer and she insisted in saying i didnt order ir, so she borought after 10 minutes. food is average, do not order cocktails cos they are not worth at all. service is the worst experienced in the latest years. "
"great location, nice loungy music and a beautiful setting, that is about it for the positives. pretty much everything else was wrong. no one came to serve our table, we waited, runners will not serve tables (understandable) but waiter never came. flagged one down for drinks and dinner. it was 17:45, kitchen opened at 18:00 so we could not order but also menu was not offered. took our drinks order, attitude was snotty & arrogant. drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, one of the pepsi bottles was used?! about 1/3 of the bottle was empty, we needed to inform the staff. no apologies and it took another 5 mins for replacement. for the rest, dirty tables are left dirty, menus are not cleaned away, ashtrays not cleaned. loungers are at an extra € but even these guests had to go to the bar to order. i saw rubbish on tables and floors that was not cleaned, broken glass that was not cleared etc. staff does not seem to be bothered to serve or work in general. softdrinks at €3,50 for 0,2l are expensive, due to location but we left without ordering food or asking for the menu. no comment from the waiter when we did not ask for a menu or order food but he was even expecting a tip which was the icing on the cake. would not recommend, place needs training and proper management. wish i had checked reviews before we sat down."
"from opening the door there was an immediate feeling that we had entered the twilight zone, but as good masochists we stayed to see what this place can offer. the staff was running around in a zombie like state, and nobody noticed us. finally we managed to draw the attention of one of them, and were pointed at an available table. everything that we ordered was disgusting and not as described on the menu. bruschetta with burrata. never seen anything like th "
the price for a burger is extremely high and it doesnt even contain what it said in menu. the staff is kind of unfriendly and expect long waiting times to be serve 
"keep looking for a top spot and move up north 20-50 km, this is one of those places people go to be seen but nothing special and you pay a tough price..."
there is one thing i have to admit: this place has a good location other than that i would not suggest this place at all. first of all we waited around 20min until the waiter came to take the order. then we specifically had to ask to clean the table of the previous guests. once i had ordered a burger of 17€ i receive have of a portion of fries. this is disappointed me in service and i have to say its not worth my money at all. this was my first and absolute last time. 
bloomingdale beach club is famous and a pace to be or a hot spot or whatev 
"since the sun came out again today we decided to go for a walk with the dog in the late afternoon and chilled out afterwards @ bloomingedales with some nice but rather expensive drinks followed by a dinner. our friend had a steak dinner, my hubby the tuna and i had the chicken sateh. it all tasted good and the good thing is that you can take your dog with you!"
"avoid this place at all costs. the setting is great which makes it tempting, but it isnt worth it. the staff were disinterested and - at times - openly rude. our order was completely messed up, the food is expensive and although we didnt let this place ruin a lovely day out, we certainly would never return. "
dropped by for some dinner and cocktails. it was pretty difficult to place an order since the staff wasnt paying any attention. after asking three runners to get somebody to take our order we finally met a waitress at our table. roughly 20 minuten had passer and the place was only occupied for  
very bad experience. slow waiters and very long waiting time for drinks and food.   cheesy waiters.  no go for this first sunny day of the year.

they are not friendly. i’ll never come here again. the way they treat their staff. 🤮 a big fat no!!
we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff don’t seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend.

"nice for a stop , lunch or small bite when touring the area. good view of the ancient harbour now obsolete and the village square."

"the spot, close to the small harbor, makes it a perfect place for drinks and sit and watch the boats go by. we had hoped more from the dinner, it was quite average and the fish dish (small soles) was not sufficient for an adult eater. service is friendly though."
"very convenient for lunch or diner when you have your boat at the harbor of bornzwaag. they have a varied menu with emphasis on fish and meat dishes. the lamb curry was good, but not at all spicy. a good wine selection."
"a cozy, comfortable place to enjoy the outdoor terrace. we ordered a few drinks and an appetiser. the drinks were warm and the appetiser was pretty bad, it seems to be from a frozen package. a deep fried item called biterbollen; we have had these all over the area and these were by far the worst. they werent very hot and were doughy and bland. after that, i would not return for anything but the view. "
food was good and ok but very unkind waiter also to my child of 4 years. very unsociable and not friendl.
"we came for dinner with 4 people on a wednesday night. we had to wait a long time before we could order and after 40 minutes bread still had not arrived, we had to go and search for the waitress. when the bread did arrived it came at the same time as our starters. there was a large group of people having dinner in another room and the staff was busy. we also had to wait very long for the main courses and to get another drink, another search for the staff was needed. no excuus from the staff nothing, we didnt feel welcome here! the food was nothing special, nice fish but no vegetables were served only a bowl of salad to share with 4 people and some fries."
"probably the best fast food/ fries place in the area. this is our regular supplier for a once-a-week fast food lunch with team. quality is consistent. on bank holidays, or on moment when you would expect the place to be open, then .... it is closed. and they can afford to do this, as theres no real competition in the are "

"i kept giving this place a chance as the food is good, and after our tenth visit we had to give up on the staff who kept ignoring up to the point we had to keep walking over to the bar during dinner. maybe they’re understaffed but it felt a bad taste after we’d spent so much money in there over the past year. it’s now off our list sadly."
on my way to eindhoven i stopped here for dinner with my partner several days a 
"we enjoyed the ice cream very much but sadly as the card machine didn’t seem to accept international cards of any kind (pre-paid, debit, credit) which had worked elsewhere, we had to sit around with small children for over an hour while one member of our party travelled to the next town to withdraw cash. there should be a sign advising this."
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.
"it was quiet in the restaurant. i ordered soup and sandwiches. the sweet potato soup was tasteless. when asked by the staff if the food was good, i told them i didnt like the soup at all. no reaction or comment whatsoever. they didnt seem to care at al "
"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is oké except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"we planned to visit this restaurant for the lunch but as we saw theres a lot of people going inside, we cancelled it and chose other place. the building of the restaurant was former manor house and the town hall of middenbeemster."
"terrible, we arrived, sat down by the bar, waited for 10 minutes and no one came to take our order. barman was just in front of us and did not acknowledge us at all."
"it is nice and the view was ok, but i think you could turn the music down a little! the food was a solid 9/10 and the water was perfect temperature!!!!!!! but i think that a drinks menu would be good.the chicken burger was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and the restaurant was very bright and happy!!! overall 4. "
the worst experience ive had in an airport restaura 
"the menu was reduced to 3 items… count them, 3. because a ‘machine’ was broken. also, despite having menus in the comfy area, you couldn’t order there and we had to move seats. ridiculous place."
"ordered few beers and top range burger, burger was ok, nothing special but not too bad eithe "
"decent food, crap service, charged extra for sauces, fries and what knows what although they were included in the menu. small amounts, but the feeling of being scammed is there"
"wrong order, wrong check and nobody care about the mistake. also its not easy to get the waitress to order second drink ☹️☹️☹️"
"today on 29october the waiter was friendly,a time ago i meet some waiter there and he was realy not like his j "
we sat at a table waiting for service for ten minutes. it was not busy and the staff never acknowledged us so we ended up leaving.
we had a couple hours before our flight and decided to have some drinks. the restaurant wasnt very busy and it seemed there were only two staff workin 
"absolutely awful. slow service, rubbish food and extremely over priced. €7.30 for a bottle of still water. then added money for ketchup and mayo that we didn’t ask for. €23 for a burger that’s not even good. avoid."
honestly horrible !!! service absolutely bad! cuttlery thrown literally at our face! quality black angus burger patty? not even in dreams. the meat taste like frozen frikandelle from a city fair truck! nothing to eat or drink there. definitely not worth the overpricing!
"i ordered drinks about 4 times and nobody brought the drinks so i’ve finished my meal without any drink, they brought just one drink of the four i’ve ordered at the end when i didn’t even want it anymore. the waitress didn’t even show up so it was very difficult to talk with her. so the service is nothing good for me."
the waitress did an appalling job of taking our ordering managed to get most of wrong. the food was delivered to the table and they almost flung it at us and went before we could say it was wrong at this point we were hungry and with our flight time getting closer we eat what we were give 
unbelievable slow service (20+ min just to be able to place order). way understaffed. the staff that was there didnt seem to care about customers having to wait.
"we got our drinks and food quickly, but the server never cane back. we needed refills of water and more drinks, but our server disappeared and nobody else came. we were charged for eight small containers of ketchup and mayonnaise that we didn’t order! we had to search for someone to pay and was then informed that they don’t divide checks. that is fine, but i have never eaten anywhere that didn’t communicate that before guests order their food. then when i checked my american express statement, they charged me twice! thank goodness, american express sorted this out for me! lesson learned- i should have checked the reviews before eating here."
"horrible service.  three tables ordered and served drinks before we decided to leave.  had plenty of time between flights, but 20 minutes if being ignored is unconscionable."
the common theme of the restaurant is food roulette. the drinks came out at a lighting pace to quench the thirst. the food however was a different story. when the food finally arrived the order was wrong and missing items. turns out the chef can’t read an order and nor can the server put half of it into the til 
"good choice of dishes,  not the usual airport selection. food freshly cooked in front of you. good service.  downside,  tables not cleaned between customers"
just appalling. food inedible. i think customers are expected to clear their own tables...see pictures... really was awful. if you want a burger go to mcdonalds...twice as nice and half the price 🙄
"i thought id get a lunch time snack here last week. i paid for it, but after half an hour it still hadnt turned up and i had a plane to catch. couldnt get a refund because the person whod taken the order had gone, and when they offered to give me a take away and promised they were bagging it up, even then after five minutes i was standing at the bar wondering where it was and just had to give up and get my pla "
"we had to search the restaurant for a table, once we finally found a table we had to then go and find menus as there were only kitchen staff and one lady behind the bar. whilst sitting we saw 5 mice running around the restaurant and under the food cabinets, so we very quickly left!"
"was confusing as we sat down and didnt get served. eventually went to bar and they said we are sitting in the wrong area and cant help, went to kitchen counter and was told quite abruptly to sit and wait for someone to come..when i said we had been waiting for a while they explained that our seating was outside of their restaurant. we had their restaurants menu on our table which had caused the confusion. thats all fine but then make a polite suggestion that we sit in the designated area to be served...not just say sorry cant do it! 😏 when we did move we still had to wait a while for the one poor waitress to come to us, and the miserable kitchen staff just snapped at her. terrible customer service... "
"horrible and angry service, not enough staff making the ones that are there to be angry. on google it says that they close at 21:30 however at 20:30 they send us away. when we asked if drinks were still possible they said no. even though the bar is still open. so we go to the bar and they are discussing their own times for closing even though its busy there. so we get served at the bar and want to find a seat. we pick a table where others are sitting as well. and they send us away even though other people are still sitting there with their drin "
"i ordered a rib eye but they told me it is not available. few minutes later another man ordered rib eye no problem. wtf? so i ordered burger, it was pre-heated and made probably few hours ago, came very dry and taste less. this place is not recommended."
very rude cook was very sarcaric. then completely ignored by the waiter.gave up after 15 mins and went to another restraunt.tbe place wasnt even that busy.
ordered the classic burger and a beer whilst waiting for the flig 
"absolutely terrible service from the bar staff, arrived at 8:40 told closed but then continued to serve others, swore at customer when asked why , i work for heineken and pass through here often , i was ashamed that they sell our brand if this is the serve they provide."
"i travel a fair bit for work… i don’t think i’ve ever had service poor enough to inspire me to write a review before. i never got the drink i ordered, the cesar salad was not very good, and service was inattentive even by european standards. think you have plenty of time to grab a bite to eat and still make your flight? maybe not if you eat here!"
"sat down with my partner and was approached by the old man waiter claiming i have to buy food to sit down and not just a drink, he got very aggressive when i told him no one else was eating around us only drinki "
"the waiter / manager was incredibly rude constantly albeit being the only server at the very busy restaurant- no excuse for complaining heavily to us when we asked for some ketchup that we didnt order it with the meal, then the drinks order was wrong and we was very polite at asking for the correct order.. again huge lamentation and when we arrived to ask for a table was just dismissed - it is very expensive but this is hands nmdown the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my entire life! avoid!!"
"absolutely shocking service, waiters very rude. forgot parts of the order and then took a long time to rectify their mistake. also seen them being very rude to people who simply wanted to order. i could understand if the place was very busy but it honestly wasn’t that busy with many empty seats."
"i had the vegan seaweed burger. super tasty i have to say but not worth 21 euro. i know airport restaurants have hefty rents to pay, but still. to add further insult you get charged extra for ketchup and mayonnaise even though when you’re offered them it’s not obvious you’re being “upsold”. also, they won’t give you a glass of delicious dutch tap water. oh no, you have to buy a bottle of imported french water - 4.25euro for 25cl."
was told to pay later! barman put extra drink on! and said we ordered €14!  gave cash bk when caugh!!
"quite a comical visit to be honest. came at a time when airport was fairly busy. the restaurant had only one waiter, a few barman and a couple of chefs. the waiter was shouting to everyone who walked in the place this area is closed and was generally storming around very moody. we had asked a few questions on the menu and got back very rude and sarcastic replies from the einstein lookalike. icing on the cake was, our burger finally arrived which was a beef burger rather than the chicken burger we ordered. as we pointed this out the waiters response was... ok my mistake i will give this away and refund you thanks bye after we had just waited 30 minutes for the burger to be prepared."
"came here during a weeknight around 5pm, sat for 30 minutes before anyone even came to serve. despite asking for a menu / drink on 3 occassions. eventually they came over and asked if i had been served yet.. then advised me not to order as they were having technical issue "
"just got 2 coffees from that place, found out i had to pay €13 for those 2 “dirty waters” as coffee is a big word. awful! a legal robbery"
"unfriendly people legit so unhappy and rude, wanted to order something and the man with the grey hair is just unfriendly and rude"
"not the easiest review to do. the food, we both had the chicken burger, was nice, dressings were fresh and wasnt greasy at all, a good 3/5 however the service was shocki "
"last time i was here i ate in the jamie oliver restaurant. never again.....that was dire. this was so much better. the service was speedy, the food good, usual airport prices but thats to be expected. would choose this again when im next in schipol in july."
"we had a completely incompetent waitress. despite being very clear when we ordered, our food had to be brought back twice and it still ended up being wrong. she gave us the completely wrong burgers that were more expensive than the ones we originally ordered, instead of having them been taken back for a third time we just ate them and they said they would only charge for the ones we originally ordered. she then tried to charge for the more expensive ones again when we went to pay, if we hadnt been so thorough she may have gotten away with charging us more. she didnt apologise for any of the mistakes at all and at one point said we had ordered something that we didnt order. it was hard to enjoy the food or find any appealing feature when the service was that bad."
"the 1st time i went was february 2022, somehow they lost my orded so i had to wait ages. this time i ordered and waited for ages anyway, the only good thing is that i wasnt the only one waiting. luckily my plan was delayed."
"the waiter was just straight up rude and racist , didn’t see him give the same treatment to other caucasian customers. had to wait around to get service for a while . was just here for a layover but i vow never to eat /stop here again."
this was ok - a little over priced for the food that was served. probably will try a different main meal during my next layover however
"been here a few times now. normally, service has been very good. due to covid it has been quite quiet, but they are losing a lot of custom due to lack of staff and very slow service as a result. no signs indicating if table service or food/drinks only areas. people walked back out as they were asking me if i worked there and if there were any staff available! i realise its difficult to keep staff available at these times, but customers must be given the impression that they will get served even if it takes time. "
"we arrived late at the hotel and wanted some food and a drink. the axis bar had a good menu and an extensive drinks menu. the food was good and ticked the box, the atmosphere was great but it is so dark!! not very sociable!"
"wow, we were in a hurry, stopped at this place. plain food, 6,5€ for a carton cup of soup which basically tasted like boiled water. the sandwich also was of equal bad quality. once paid: plenty of tables to chose from where to sit… if you want to sit in someone else his dirt. overpriced, plain food and dirty."
i has to stay the whole night at the airport and the blonde girl working out there needs to learn how to treat the costum 
the worst place to go to at this airport. the staff is absolutely awful and the food was terrible.  to make matters worse i witness a mouse running around.
"got stranded one night at schiphol  unfortunately! 23-24october 23 food was good but the girl who served me wasn’t very friendly and how she spoke to me wasn’t very nice! got free food vouchers because of delays,wished i used it somewhere else!"
very rude staff. little knowledge of their food and their allergens menu is confusing. they had no tea or decaf coffee and i was rudely told to go elsewhere if i wanted these. go somewhere else!
paid €8.25 for a sandwich (hummus/avocado/salad) and was sick the whole night. i didn’t think this would be the kind of sandwich to go off so draw your own conclusion as to why i was sick…
"want to queue and be stared at by staff without any of them answering your questions, and be made to feel like you’re brain damaged? this is the place for you! €7.30 for two croissants in a plastic bag as well (just to give you an idea of the price). sandwich tasted like paper. great experience!"
paid 11 euros for a breakfast with a croissant and a horrible coffe. come here for the chips maybe..
"i was travelling through schiphol during an evening. given the current covid pandemic i was not surprised to find many food outlets shut, but conveniently amsterdam bread co was ope "
this restaurant is located in the transferarea. a sandwich costs about 7 euro. there are some places to sit but you can also take away. the food tastet ok.
terrible experience with this joint. a whole lot of money for a absolutely not fresh sandwich. result: toilet visites and stomach acne almost richt after consument.
"very disappointing. the bread on my (expensive) sandwich was stale. given that all they do is make sandwiches, this is pretty poor. avoid."
cashiers were rude and the prices were high (as usually in the airport). food at least was decent. customer service (or the lack of it) was the reason for a bad review.
"they made our iced coffees piping hot, then claimed that thats how you always make iced coffees, hot..."
"we searched for coffee during our layover at the amsterdam airport. we passed several options, continuing to seek out a decent coffee shop but kept passing places that offered coffee from a machine. (yes, i’m a coffee snob i suppose). we ordered lattes here along with a pastry for each of us. average at best. as we were sitting and having our drink, i looked up to the second floor where i saw a starbucks. while i generally avoid that chain when there are other options, i did wonder if their amsterdam airport location prepared coffee in a legitimate espresso machine versus a push button coffee vending machine."
"i have never had such a disgusting caesar salad in my life. dry chicken, long salad strings with black edges and a sour dressi "
"food was overpriced and poor quality. there was at least 6 or 7 staff all standing around doing absolutely nothing when there was a long list of people waiting to be served. they all seemed more more interested in joking around with each other and singing along to the music than serving customers, there was only one on the till, being distracted by the others. i was trying to get my sandwich toasted and when a staff member eventually toasted it they then walked off and left. i had to eventually ask another person just to get my food. whole experience was ridiculous. would not recommend."
"fairly decent as airport food goes, these pre-made sandwiches gave me some much-needed fresh food in my system before my long flight. prices are routine for airport food, and most importantly, they get you through quickly."
"i needed a quick bite between flights and this was good. it is expensive and busy, but it was more affordable than the other options!"
"no menu board and cant see all food selection at once. you cant go back to select something you may have prefered at the start as queue area too narrow to turn around, and line of people behind y "
we wanted to have a relaxed coffee and sandwich before departing on our vacatio 
"had the chicken, avocado and bacon. didnt finish it, because it was way to salty. so that was a waist of the 7€."
"the line is moving slow, could be quicker if the coffee was made by a separate person. servings on sandwich could be more. seating a bit awkward, distance to the floor too big for normal sized people. the food was good. people friendly."
"good airport lunch. i had a cheese sandwich and strawberry yoghurt smoothie. reasonable prices. easy to purchase food and the shop is a good size, plenty of space to move around. also was very popular at lunchtime. good amount of staff to keep queues down. please note, food is kept out without individual wrapping."
"i stopped at this store when i returned from cardiff to narita via amsterdam. i paid about jpy 2,400 with a smoothie, a croissant, a salad and a evian. this quality is only worth at the most about jpy 1,500 in japan."
"i was at schiphol airport on boxing day and was looking forward to apple pie with whipped cream which is a typical dutch treat. we found that we could not find a table at this place without rubbish and that was clean. we therefore cleared one table ourselves and got ourselves apple pie . my goodness, this was the worst apple pie ever: a lump of fatty crust and crumble with about 2 apple slices. i wonder if the manager of this place had ever apple pie before in his (dutch?) life. and while we spent 45 minutes here waiting for the departure of our plane, no one bothered to clear tables for other customers. this was not because of lack of staff, but they were too busy chatting. although schiphol airport makes an effort to attract customers and makes this airport as appealing as possible with their recent renovations, the amsterdam bread company is a let down for the airport, especially in such a prominent place (near the famous ‘clock’. such a shame. who is in charge here?"
"food was ok (ham croissant) service was ok, stand in line to order, and the people behind the counter were very nice. getting hot tea was not real easy but we did it. seating early in the morning was a little bit if a challenge."
"really, there is no decent place in schiphol anymore where you can grab a good pastry or anything. sadly, starbucks probably has the best croissants these days. schiphol should look at zurick airport - the swiss have the quality food covered. in schiphol, despair - including this outlet. mediocracy central, at airport prices"
this is one of the most visible and accessible eateries at schipol and as such it does an ok job serving bread-based fare to travellers who frankly are not exactly spoilt for choi 
"prices were fair, fortunately they werent crazy busy due to the time (8-11 a "
this restaurant was very busy when we visited so seating was at a premium. the sandwiches were tasty and the drinks fre 
"there is a decent variety of sandwiches and other pastries. there also appears to be coffee and the like available, but i stuck with the juices and water. plenty of variety there, as well as items for purchase. the food is generally priced for what one might expect for airport food. the juices were quite good, but the other baked items did not seem to have much taste. "
past this place every week and liked the look of it. as i walked in a picked up a bottle of evian and then almost dropped it. 3.35 €. come on its only wate 
"living my life for thirty years ,now suddenly find myself being misgendered by two staff  either this company are transphobic of there is lack of staff training wont be going there again  found it very offensive"
"open after everything else seems to have closed - so it gets points for that of course. the only eating out option if you are at yotelair. nice selection of beers, wine, etc - but selection of hot food was very limited and very pastry driven. "
"bought a pizza which was rock hard like dried bread and after i took it back i chose a sandwitch instead which, most likely, was sitting there for hours. did not complain again as it wouldnt go anywhere, had to depart anyway. on the fair side, if it was fresh, it would be a tasty sandwitch but again, as often happens in airports, too expensive for what you are getting."
popped in here while travelling (obviously) and i spotted treasure! their macarons (weird name) are actually amazingly coconuty coconut biscuits. freshly crunchy on the outside and gently gooey moist on the inside (but fully cooked)! only slightly sweet but easy to munch two at a sitting. a little piece of heaven on earth. 🙂🙂
"they serve decent coffee and a nice choice of sandwiches. on the expensive side of course, but what did you expect at the airport? ;-)"
"ordered two sandwiches here before a flight. stale bread on a piece of cardboard. postmix coke with no fizz for €3,50. and a plastic muffin. tables were not clean anywhere. never again."
"this is a nice, modern clean place in the airport, service and food were ok and prices the usual too high because it is an airport"
"this must be the dirtiest place in the whole airport, teenagers working a side j "
"nothing special. however, the coffee and the croissants are quite good. if you just need a bite try it."
"quality of food, drinks ok. but the server short changed us; we had requested 2x (2 item) combos @ 3.25 - of coffee and croissant and a banana/vanilla muffin as per the tent card. in addition, 2 waters and a cheese p "
"i bought tea, sandwich, and a chocolate bar here. it was all well priced and tasted good.   the store has more than food. i bought make-up here.   no complaints."
just went there today and i think i never had such bad service before. i have ordered a sandwich and a glass of water and the waiter comes back with my food and a tiny (already open) bottle of water. i told that i just wanted a glass and after he left everything and already starting to walk back he said and i quote here “sorry the water from the tap is very bad here” without even leaving me the chance to arg 
"airport was busy and this place looked a little quieter. put my order in (chicken satay and glass of wine). after an age i checked on my order, my wine hadnt been put through and the food would be a while. eventually wine turned up. an age later my food arrived after being offered to two other tables. wish it hadnt served better looking food to my dog. was some talk of a free wine but as i write the head waitress is arguing against this. unbelievable really, avoid"
"***avoid this restaurant*** went 01/12 with a few friends. ordered two satay chicken mains and 2 of their hamburgers and some nachos. absolutely awful... chicken satay sauce was a thick disgusting mess with chewy chicken and the wedges seemed like that had been sat for a while as some were solid and others barely warm. the burger were equally as bad, way too overloaded with sauce to make up for the dry beef burger and wedges on them were again bad. the nachos had a enough cheese to cause a small heart attack making them into a solid block which was difficult to eat. very expensive and waitresses didn’t seem at all interested with how the food was. ***avoid this restaurant***"
standard place to eat something at schippol airpo 
"crossroads is a good place to visit after waiting for someone at the arrival hall in schiphol. we had some tea and the famous dutch bitterballen. however, these were not fried in oil but warmed in an oven (afterward we saw that the menu said oven bitterballen so we should have known). they were warm and still soft, and two of them were even to cold to eat. a big disappointment. the tea was nice and hot though."
"a party of 9 of us tried to eat here.... the meals all came at different times, all food was cold, but 2 were too cold to be acceptable and were sent back. we also found plastic in one of the meals! we tried to speak to the manager about it but she was very rude. never had a worse meal/service!"
i am also working in hospitality and i know that it is a challenge to find good staf 
"while a good place for a beer, the food was poor. my burger, which was passable, came with a serving of wedges (listed as french fries on the menu), while my wife had a steak (tough) served with some frozen vegetables that were luke warm and looked unappetising. the service was efficient and reasonably friendly. would look at other options next time."
"one star is even too much .i was waiting there for 10 minutes to be attended but none of the staff came . they were busy chit chatting with each other. i reached the counter to place the order. girls standing there didn’t even greet. they ask me “ what you want to have” in a rude tone. another one rolled her eyes . service was pathetic . they serve the food as if they are doing a favor. most of the time i have seen them looking at customers, whispering to each other and laughing at them . i work in service industry and i understand the body language very well. i ll not suggest this restaurant to anyone . i did find them racist. white people were served first and they look down on other nationalities. i have noticed a staff member was talking to his friend ( was not the restaurant employee)for 15 minutes and i think she gave him some free food while customers who were waiting to pay and eat was ignored.restaurant authorities you can check your cameras. your staff is horrible. if they were working in my company they would have got terminated because rudeness and racism is not tolerated at all."
"service was slow and food average, that in itself doesn’t warrant a terrible rating, t "
crossroads is a good place to wait for arriving passengers in the arrival 2 hall. it is next to the arriving passengers and nicer setup while you don’t how long you wait is going to be. other than that it’s a regular cafe not to be remembered afterwards.
restaurant located inside the hote 
we had a dreadful experience at mcdonald’s in the airport. food was freezing cold and when we brought it back they laughed at us. disgraceful experience altogether. even management was not helpful. stay away
waited for ages to be seated with staff actively ignoring us. extremely rude when spoken to. do not go here if you want a nice meal.
"waited for ages at the door to be seated with members of staff walking to and fro past us with no acknowledgement. eventually got a table sat next to 2 other guests, which was a bit odd, but we were grateful for a seat. we were completely ignored after this and had to ask at the bar if we could order food and drinks. our drinks arrived - food was left on the pass for a long time while disorganised members of staff flitted about or stood chatting. our food arrived and the waitress left, i presumed for cutlery but i was wrong. i had to go to the kitchen area to ask for a knife and fork. choice of food on the menu is poor and the food wasnt great but was let down by every other part of the experience. had to ask to pay the bill - over 50 euro for pasta, a burger, a medium beer and a coke."
went in this café for breakfast before my fligh 
"first of all i really do think this restaurant is in violation of eu policy with no mention of allergens in the menu and no information about this when asked. waiter had to check each individual dish with the kitchen. making rhings worse the steak was watery, weak, and seemed microwaved. absolutely not somewhere to eat. the frites was fairly nice though. "
"i decided to skip burger king for het palais! a big mistake as i had the experience of the worst hamburger ever! the meat taste bad and us obviously some industrial chemical cook up! this was a true art of incompetence by this rather nice lookng place.avoid the food, unless you are through a half bottle of vodka at the bar!"
"unwelcoming, unfriendly, rude staff. we were on transit and wanted to sit for coffee on a very busy day at schipol airport, one table was available but without chair, so the waiter told us that we must sit at the bar since this table had no chair. another customer gently offered us a chair that we took to sit at the table. the waiter comes yelling at us that we did not follow his instructions and that we must sit at the bar again although we managed to find a chair. poor sense of hospitality, no proactiveness, 0 customer service!"
the staff is everything but friendly especially the old bold man. i am happy that i didn’t spend my money at that place. please do yourself a favor and start your holiday somewhere else.
horrible servic 
"on the 24th of june at around 19-00, my father, had an unfortunate experience of being subjected to rude behavior by an employee of het paleis bar in terminal 1. the waiter in question without provocation used inappropriate, racially motivated words on my father. i am attaching the photo of the employee in question. please go to another bar if you read this."
"very standard dish, chicken satay, looked like cooked some hours ago and pre-fab. prawn crackers probably made yesterday. fries are better in every other place in the benelux. and this eur 25. my mistake for being hungry and optimistic."
"i was told the food would be 30 minutes, after 1 hour and 15 minutes there was still no sign of my food. however, two tables next to me who came after me had been served their meals. when i asked what was happening i was told there was a mistake in the kitchen and my food would be another 15 minutes. when my food finally did arrive (chicken satay and chips), it was bland and only slightly warm. there was no apology for the delay. when i asked to pay i was ignored and had to ask 3 times. it’s like the staff don’t realise they are working in an airport and people might have somewhere to be. the chicken satay and gin & tonic cost 35€ and there wasn’t even a garnish with the gin. pathetic. wish i had gone to burger king! don’t be fooled by the nice exterior, this place isn’t worth the price or the wait."
"waiting to get seated just got too tiresome, as staff continued to ignore us.. we were directed to the restaurant when the cafe had closed the kitchen at 20.00. for now, not recommendable."
"slow and uninspired service, and gas station level burger. i regret not going to burger king instead. we had to wait for the bill a long time, and then had to get up from the table and pay at the desk to get out. at the same time people were queuing to get inside."
"what an awful place. i came here today with my partner, saw they sold a meatless burger, double checked with the waitress that it was vegan - she assured me it was and told us to take a table. after a short wait we were greeted by a different waiter, so being careful as always i asked him to confirm it was vegan which he did, but then on being asked about the mayonnaise, he responded well i dont know if its vegan or not... so i asked him if they could veganize it and after briefly checking with the chef he confirmed it was not vegan but vegetarian. okay. can you please tell me the vegan options? i asked him, only to be told that this restaurant does not cater for vegan "
"very small menu, great service and a perfect place to have a beer and a hamburger meanwhile you wait at the airport. i’ve visited twice when connecting flights."
"the restaurant looks nice from outside, thats why we choose it. but the food and drink selection was a disappointment. they couldnt provide a slice of gluten free bread, or any  milk alternative , or even a cup of decaff coffee for our breakfast."
"went here for lunch and ordered the club sandwich without tomato. when i got the sandwich i could straight away spot a massive tomato glaring at me. i told the waiter, who apologized and took it back. she then came back 2 minutes later with what was obviously the same sandwich. on the crust there was gooey tomatoseeds and i found two pieces of tomato still within the sandwich. told the other waiter about it when she asked how everything was. she said she would talk to the waiter in question.. aaand proceeded to never return to our table. we eventually paid at the counter. no discount, no nothing. my gfs 18 euro pasta was mall cafe quality at best (which, to be fair, is expectable at an airport). left the place annoyed and unsatisfied. would not recommend"
how a great international airport can accept such a terribel restaurants is beyond my understanding. its been there for a long time and its just getting wor 
not very good service considering you are on a time limit at the airport. took 15 minutes before anyone took our order.  would not recommend if you do not have much time at the airport
"lunch time in schiphol and where to go? fast- or slow food? slow this time. seems pretty average after all, and since its inside the transit area they can, more or less, charge whatever they want, following the international airport codex of pricing, meaning hi "
"the staff seemed too careless about covid.  for example one server wasn’t wearing a mask, my table wasnt cleaned even when i asked, and the staff did not look like they were cleaning their hands."
i went in yesterday and we were seated at a table outside and was informed that all services had to be done via the qr code set at the table. this in itself isnt a proble 
good location for a coffee or to grap something to drink  the coffee is quite okay. the offered food is nothing special.
we have come here for several years and earlier it has been ok and a tradition. this time it was awfull. prefabricated burger beef. far worse than mcdonalds. end of tradition. never again!
we are here while waiting for a transfer flig 
busy restaurant where you can sit for a couple of hours while you eat despite reading reviews about poor service it was very good and ive got no complaints. if you wait 2 hours then you need to be more assertive to get attention......youre only one amongst lots. and before you complain try doing the job yourself......and are you always perfect at what you do...all d 
"this was the worst service i have ever received in a restaurant. if the food had been decent, the service would have been bad enough, but unfortunately the food was bad, too. over cooked, dry salmon, pumpkin soup that tasted “off” like it came from a can, a strange white sauce poured heavily over the green beans, and more. "
"because of the klm caterer strike, we ended up having breakfast at this restaurant and the hot croissant with ham and cheese was perfect. the coffee was also very good."
"my review does not refer to the food or value of this establishment, but has i feel, important things to reco "
"for a sit down airport restaurant, the service goes beyond poor. we had to fight to place an order, and it was impossible to pay a bill — the staff not only refused, but was not willing to find the right person. there were at least six of us competing to get the server’s attentio "
waited for two hours before waiter said that the kitchen had cancelled our order. meanwhile other people came in and got served the same thing that we order 
"...this is the place to go.  we had burgers, fries and a salad. all “nice and cold”.  service was hard to get hold off, not very knowledgeable about what they are serving and probably not giving a damn anyway."
"we ordered 2 beer and hamburgers waiting for our next flight and it took about 45 minutes for them to first come with one hamburger, then 15 minutes later the second hamburger. still no beer. i told the waitress for the first time about us still not having drinks - we waited a while, nothing happened. i asked another waiter about the drinks, waited. nothing. when we were nearly done with the hamburgers i went upp to them again, and then at last we got 2 beer. in the end noone came even near us, so that we could ask for the bill. had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the 50 euro for everything. "
the service was bad! we waited a really long time to get service and it ended with us searching for a waitress. the staff had a bad attitud and was not serviceminded. when we got our drinks our soda had no gas at all. the table was not clean or cle 
i had to wait 20 minutes until we were served and then had to wait another 20 minutes for it be deliver 
id rather drink here than in the alternative at schipol. they have decent beer and traditional dutch food. its always been quite relaxed. the service here is much more friendly than other airport bars i have visited: staff smile and seem motivated to provide helpful service.
we thought we come here because it was more expensive and you’d expect better service - wrong! i had to go and ask for assistance and was impolitely told to go back to my seat and wait!
"what can i say: when you want to have a meal at the airport, usually you are quite* in a hurry. this place is totally disorganised, no sense of customer service. we ordered the burger and a chicken sandwich. although the drinks were served immediately we had to threaten to leave after 30 minutes, the only answer that the waiter gave was that everyone was complaining ..it took another 10 or 15 minutes to get our food..since we were close to the kitchen we could see that our food was ready for a while already when the waitress picked it u "
"i was here on two different occasions, and have two very different opinion "
"this restaurant is horrible. this is the first time i stomped out of a restaurant as it has such horrible services. they want us to look for an empty table on our own.. and all tables were apparently reserved. my point is.. if you do not have the capacity or resources, dont expect your customers to be scavenging around for an empty table that can be used. also, before we went into the restaurant, there is this waiter who gave us a racist look. yes we are asians. whats your problem??? stop being racist, move  "
impolite and indifferent waiters. i was waiting for 30 min and was not possible to even order. really very bad behavior.
total lack of understanding of what service means. also i am not too sure the staff realize that they are working on an airport and that people need to take plan 
"the quiche (with spinach) was quite good actually, and there was plenty of parmazan cheese and dressing on the side salad....but i fail to understand why the dressing was on the bottom of the plate and not over the sal "
staff were really rude and didn’t seem bothered about giving them 100+ euros. was waiting 15 minutes to be served and had to ask for a menu followed by waiting another 20 minutes until the waiter didn’t even bother to come and take our order! quite terrible service 
"so, ive been sitting for the las 15 on one of the outside tables waiting for someone to come. as i could see the waiters were busy i went inside and wanted to place the order myself. the barman sent me back to my table kindly letting me know that (quote) we have table service (unquote). so we are leaving. let the barman know my displeasure in no uncertain terms and i didnt get a single word in retur "
total chaos. took forever to take our order. then took forever to deliver the meal. after 40 minutes suddenly they realized the meal we ordered was no longer on stock. waited a further 30 minutes to get another choice. terrible.
well the burger was ok but the fries cold and the service personal is more interested in their mobile phones than serving the guests. toke 10 minutes to get the bill and pay
"thought to go for a quick bite. ordered a salad and waited for more than 20 min. then they came back that they ran out of salad! ordered something else and they promised to speed it up. after another 25 min still nothing ! asked one the ladies who were serving to check, no feedback at all. went again to another waitress and they forgot again my orde "
this restaurant is located between terminals so it is convenient to pause here if you are going to fly outside of eu. we (like almost everybody else) ordered their classic burgers and beer combo. food was absolutely ok and price level as expecte 
"10 minutes is how long i waited befora i left. i was sitting 5 meters from the bar, but the 5(!) waiters were to busy talking to eachother, so nobody came to get my order."
"from the outside this cafe looks nice and cosy. however, you are in for quite an experience from start to finish, if you get in. they want you to wait at the entrance for seating, which makes sense, but apparently no one is assigned to seating, so you can wait forever before you get the attention of staff. once seated it is another trick to again get the attention of staff to order, and once this has been achieved food takes a while to arrive. the menu is ok, but nothing spectacular. having finished your meal you will again have to work miracles to get the attention of staff to pay, and if you are paying by credit card you will be asked to go to the bar counter anyway, so you might as well make your way there to start with, and see if you can get the attention of anyone there. all in all not a good experience, and a little sad, as the location and atmosphere could make this a great experience with a little coordination and enhanced service from staff."
"the service is really shockingly slow and poor. i waited for 30 minutes to place my order. drinks never arrived. food arrived about 30 minutes later. nearly missed my flight on a 90 minute connection. food was passable, but not great - not good enough for the pain of the service. i travel through schiphol a lot, but will never go back. "
i was waiting more than 30 min before a waiter came to me for taking the order. at an airport where the people are in hurry before the have their flight this is a no-

"very unpolite and unprofessional service. discussion mutually, being unpolite when serving. i will never come near this place."
two years ago they served ok food. now the best they serve is x-tra cold heinek 
"they tried to cheat with the wine . we ordered a bottle of wine which they brought already opened and explained how that was normal course . after we insisted they quickly exchanged for an unopened wine which was still overpriced ( 12 eur retail vs 65 at the restaurant ) . the burgers were with frozen beef, the chicken caesar was with smoked precooked supermarket chicken . this place is fully unacceptable for the standard of amsterdam airport . "
"waiting 45 minutes for serving. everytime we approach the staff, they say please wait a minute ill be right with you."
i have written quite some reviews of this place. that is because i return here once a while since i travel a lot from this airport. review score varied in the past with a single uplift once where i had the impression management paid notice of my suggestio 
"45min waitingtime. two of us got their food, the third burger was forgotten and i had to order something else. disaster!"
"airport restaurant only has one main goal: be fast. most of the people cannot wait 40 minutes to be seated when you have 20 free tables and 50 minutes for a salad. great job, you did it."
"a complete horror show. staff were clueless, ignorant and not interested.  shambles of a place. every customer was very frustrated. avoid. i feel sick....."
"the only place that comes close to this restaurant in originality is probably murphys, still het paleis has been an icon of the departures area since 2004. its a scaled down replica of samuel sarphatis 1950s palace for folk art. decor is art deco with lots of wood, cast iron and a gigantic brewers kettle up on the first floor. coke goes for € 3,50, beer for 5, soup 8,50 and a plate of food around 20. when i visited last, service was quite ok, even if the place was packed."
we usually eat at het paleis when we travel from schiphol and the food is pretty decen 
"it seems that i was not the first. went to the bar counter and stood there for 5mins waiting to be served, with 5 staff members inside and around the bar. decide to face one of them, who told me that i could not be served at the bar (after 3 persons took their drinks, seating around the bar counter). i have asked to talk with the manager, all of them answered, “there are no manager”. asked for the complaint book, there was no book either. this people just doesn’t care, people are just keep coming in. my complaint will follow to the netherlands and airport authorities. concerning the ones reading this review... good luck!"
pretty good restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere and very nice service.i like it and i keep going .
"the staff are not interested in doing their job. we had to find the menus ourselves, and left after 30 minutes without them even taking our order."
"i had a nice asian chicken, but the waitor was not so interested in his customers. perhaps a how to treat your customer-workshop would be useful...?!"
thought this place looked quite nice from the outside but should have realised it was a shocker when i saw filthy tables and staff just wandering by the queue of people at the doo 
"been here several times. interiör a mixturen between belle epoque and an irish pub. usually quite fast service, however oftentimes (as most service personer on schiphol) indifferent. food ok bit nothing more."
"we wanted to have meal at a restaurant at schiphol with real table service, which is not very easy to find. the place at first sight looks inviting, and so does the menu, but as has already been mentioned by previous reviewers, service is pretty bad. it took ages for someone to notice us, the waitresses were less than pro-active and more interested in chatting to each other than serving customers. the food in itself was fine, as were the drinks, but overpriced. better management of staff is strongly advised, but as all the catering options at schiphol are run by the same company and therefore monopolised, there is probably little motivation to improve."
"youll be deluded. even in non-peak hours theyll let you down. slow, unfriendly service and delusional food (untrue to description)."
"the black coffee was fine and the espresso was not the best, a bit acidic. the seating was fine, less crowded as at starbucks. friendly staff."
"the bread was far to hard to cut through with the butter knife. tasteless and no gravy or sauce in the burger. ketchup and mayo was presented next to the plate, then you had to build your burger yourse "
my flight with klm got delayed and i received on the klm app one voucher of 10 euros value. i picked some snacks and when i showed the app voucher on my phone they did not accept unless it was paper printed. i left the stuff there. 28.02.2018 16:14
this is not meat ! mcdonalds is better !!  french fries not good either.   only the beer is ok.  far too expensive for what it is.   nice situation thats all...
"this place is very strange. you wait forever for service, but some people are evidently fine with that. the staff are quite abrupt when they do finally notice you, and they are not particularly rushed. looking around though you feel that you might be the only person with a flight to catch, as plenty of people are smiling, drinking and chatti "

"the service and food was so bad, i downloaded tripadvisor, created a new account and made my first comment here just so i can tell you all how bad this place i "
"not a good choice. they were very busy, so i felt like i am annoying them with my questions. long waiting time for baverege, but fast food delivery. the burger i had was good teste except for being totatally killed by overcooking... will not go again"
"early bfst when going on a family vacation?? 6,95€ for a simple take away sandwich!!!! absolutely unaccepatable"
the service here could be significantly better here. so could the food. at best it is boring snacks - nothing more  on the positive side the het paleis is placed centrally in schiphol airport.
"pricey place, found a hair in my food, pointed it out to waitress who took my plate away and never returned with an explanation. later went to pay and they charged the full amount saying the hair i found was from an artichoke even though no artichoke was on the plate. best to avoid. "
"sandwiches and coffee before boarding a flight. 45 euro for 4 sandwiches and 4 drinks .. is overpriced, especially if the coffee is not good. went to neighbor starbucks for a good dopio afterwards."
been here twice or three time on business transfers. ( not always my choice). the food is quite alright. i had the dutch burger (without bread...coeliac). they were happy to modify the meal for my gluten requirements so that is ni 
"nice service, food is ok (we had some snacks before our flight), drinks ok (a standard dutch pub measure.) beers fresh from the barrel. but prices are a real rip-off. for a ketel1, where you pay in a normal pub between 2 and 3 euro, 8.50 was charged. for the dutch delecacy bitterballen we paid 7 euro for a portion of six whilst in normal pubs you pay between 4 and 5 euro. a 3 for the pub but a 1 for the rip-off"
"we were changing planes in amsterdam and have used this place before. the food and service were always good. we arrived there with around 55 minutes before having to go to the gate for the next plane, ordered soup and sandwiches and a couple of beer "
"people working here really hate their job. if not, they do a good job of acting. don’t be surprised to be forever waiting at your table because waiter will never look at you. you need to ‘grab’ a waiter for servic "
"we came here for a cappuccino and were sitting outside. after some time without service we went inside to order and the staff was very rude. one waiter told us to order at the bar and at the bar they told us to order at the waiter. the waiter thenbtold us he would make a round through the bar and would serve us very last. finally after 30+ minutes another waiter served the cappuccino by almost throwing them on the table. very bad service, do not go here. horrible place!"
"airport restaurants are airport restaurants. so we dont use them with great expectations. but this one nearly drove us insane with the service. we had to remind our drinks four times, and kindly so. in return we had rude attitude instead of an apology. i urge the owners to train their staff about the basics of etiquette if hey want to keep charging the prices they do."
airport cafes are airport cafes. very seldom a place you return to me. this is no exception: i will not return. overpriced caesar salad and a sloppy served white beer. service quite nonchalant.
"this is one of the best places to eat. you can read my many reviews as i am a frequent guest. the only problem most of the staff suffer from is arrogance and lack of real customer service. the typical waiter looks away from anyone so you need to stand up and get attention if you want to order. typical unfriendly posture, hating the job or simply no education in hospitality at all. i have been here over 20 times now and must say this is the core problem of the staff; no hospitality. they are there to make their hours and unluckily serve you when they feel like it. nothing wrong with the food; just with the people serving  "
"i was recently departing schiphol and wanted to try a new restaurant, and when i walked past the striking two-story building-within-a-building of the grand cafe het paleis, i thought it would be a good choice. after nearly a 10-minute wait to be seated, i was ushered to a dirty table by a server who promptly disappeared. 20 minutes later, a different server appeared and, when i asked politely, gave me a menu. i ordered a eur 6 belgian trippel and the dutch burger, a 180g beef patty with gouda and bacon. although the menu doesnt mention it, the burger comes with fries. the food arrived in about 15 minutes and was delicious. once i finished eating, i waited another 15 minutes or so for my check. the food was quite good, and the hardwood, glass, and brass decor of the bar is pleasant to look at. however, the service was slow even by european standards, so i wont be going back."
really slow service. we had to wait for 20 min for two salads. the tables were not cleaned and the service looked really unhappy with their job. not coming back.
"food was ok but we had to wait 15 minutes and call 4 times the waiters to order our meal. actually i had to go myself to call one of them to fibally get attention. even after the order they left the table dirty from previous customers and i asked one of the waiters to clean it up. no follow up, so i asked again another one who answer that she did not have anything to use to clean it and it was not her job and suggested me to ask another one. therefore for the second time i had to get up and go asking to clean the table. when they finally delivered the food the table was still dirty and the waiter started putting down our plates on the dirty table. i told him i would not have eaten my food on a disgusting table with glasses and food from previous customers and after another careless comment and simile from the waiter, he finally cleaned it "
it was not that busy and apparently they couldnt accept more people in the restaurant! i find that really disappointing since it is the only real restaurant to eat at schiphol... maybe we could try next time.
"went there for dinner. many tables free, but no one care to clean them. no waitres no hostess to guide you to a table. when asking where to sit; choose any table  but the case was no clean tables. aprroaching the staff was disappointin "

"beautifully decorated buzzy place, after 10 minutes you forget you are actually at the airport.  after 30 minutes (with no food) the thought of catching a flight comes back to your mind.  after 45 mins you want to fly home.  shame"
"looking at the same menu as 10 years back, there is a limit to how many times you think chicken satay is exciting. but really there is a huge lack of good dining options at schiphol."
"according to the airport information desk, this is the only sit-down restaurant in the main terminal of the airport.  it was not overly cramped, the food was pretty good, and the price was acceptable by airport menu standards."
i was there looking for a lunch when i was waiting for my transit flight back to hk. my husband and i walked in the restaurant a waitress asked 
queues too long for average food and snotty waitresses who think they are goddesses who have the power of life and death
"busy place in the heart of ams airport, where i usually have dinner before flying back home with a late flight. staf is really welcoming, and there is a variety of meals for you to chose from, from light finger foods to full size burgers."
"i wanted to go to a proper restaurant in the amsterdam airport so i came across this one that looked decent. i ordered the spicy coconut soup, along with bread. oh my! the soup was very cold when it arrived. and the spice level was non existent! it should not be advertised as spicy when there is honestly no spice whatsoever. i was actually confused about thi "
"good service, quick and friendly. good standard pretty good for an airport . as always for captive audience pretty pricey, but if the food is ok you dont mind too much. this restaurant fits purpose and as better than most."
"supposedly table service, dont be fooled. ignored for the first 15 mins and no the place was not busy, and quite a noisy place with echo and a tad cold. i ordered satay, which was dry and stale along with the fries. there was no love to be found in the food at all, they are not thinking about your next visit. definitely overpriced for the quality. will not return."
"last dinner in the netherlands for this time. an ok ribeye, a good tiramisu, a good bottle of rioja matching the ribeye perfectly. to end wit "
"ordered a plain rib-eye steak medium +. the food came after a long time of waiting, and it turned out they had brought the wrong order. i pointed this out and told that i had ordered something else. then i get a steak that is raw and cold, which i again explain is not okay. after an eye rolling they tried again after a long time of waiting. i ended up with a bad and tastelessly overcooked steak and side dishes and vegatables melted completely. it appears theyve put everything in the oven for re-heating. (at this point i realized this, since the plate was burning hot!) poor service and food, overly priced! left with the decision that im not coming here again for sure. ps. im a former chef and a waiter, trust me on this one."
i had a caesar salad and the satay chicken skewer

"stopped for a meal before our flight, but might as well not hav "
"not exactly grand rather big and spacious self service place, you wont have to wait to be seated. popular and always busy, just opposite security checks, yet the food is fresh and plentiful."
we had beers here waiting for a connection. the food seemed quite good and primarily dutch. beers are ok in that you get more choice than just heineken. it has a nice atmosphere and looks different to the usual airport bar.
"airports are often a challenge when you want to eat something proper, still have some time left and not granted access to the lounges. you often have the fast food places, bars with bar food, sandwich counters and such. so yes it is nice to be able to sit in a bit more restaurant type grand cafe where there are waiters to help you. then at least you dont have to carry your food tray in one hand and your lugage in the other, which is often not practical when you travel alone. this place would suit you. staff is friendly, bit clumpsy in my case. food came quick. yet the quality is compared to the price not in balance. its too expensive. the flavour is average and you can make it yourself at home as well. even the taste was of product you buy at your local supermarket. why 20 euro almost for a chicken sate with pre fabricated tasting rice. and almost 8 euros for a small glass of wine? it is not a premium place, the airport prices again. unfortunate. i picked 3 stars as rating where it should be 2,5. convenience yes, quality no. "
the food and service were o 
"i pass through schiphol frequently and its hard to find somewhere to kill time and relax over food in the airport. this place is not inviting - crowded, noisy and with cramped tables. but surprisingly the food was ok - generous, tasty and comforting chicken satay. and the service was civil and quick enough. what a horrible place to work as humanity surges in and out, either bored witless or frantically rushed. i think the staff do pretty well considering. for an airport its better than cdg paris but not as good as lhr t5 london."
"nothing to complaint, but those airport restaurants always create this nonsense stress feeling. difficult to enjoy. they are probably trying to rotate the tables too fast. too many tables. too much noice. service just ok. you are a number, not a customer."
"we have tried it several times because it is a restaurant on airport schiphol where there is service. but that is just the problem: the service is sooooo slow. when tou ask about it, the utterly uninspired staff simply says that it is normal to wait 45 minutes for a simple sandwich. with no regret whatsoeve "
"not only they did not clean our table, but we had to order 3 times. we did not get glasses for our water. the staff was incompetent and lost - everyone saying someone else would serve us. we wait for the food. and we still were seen as inconvenient because we dared to complain."
"cant say that id eat here again. i was left standing by the entrance for a minute or so before i decided to simply find myself a vacant table. plenty of waiters saw me, but none of them bothered to acknowledge my presence and help me to find a tabl "
"look nice from the outside. a little bit noisy with music and bad acoustics. got a ride year which the cook seems to have cooked instead of fried. bad quality meat with another of fat (even for a rib eye). the vegetables were lousy, however the mashed potatoes was good. there were oot of ice for the dessert at 5pm! the servants were a little bit slow but nice and friendly. not a place i will visit again"
"where in the universe does fast and attentive service matter more than anywhere else? yes, on an airpor "
schiphol airport does not have that many places to go for good food. this grand cafe offers very decent food. that is simply the reason why i go here. i frequently visit this place when i travel outbound at lunch ti 
"only restaurant we ever go to at schiphol. waiters are friendly and the food is ok! its hot and tastes good. seriously, they make the best bitterballen ever eaten at an airport."
"ok place, but typically airport café with nice food but double or even triple price. it hurts to pay 3,15€ for a small bottle of mineral water, when 1l in the super market costs 0,65€. good offer of sandwiches and friendly staff."
went in to get a burger with chips and a co 
"average food at an above average price, although to be expected in an airport. unfortunately the service was abysmal, 45 minutes to order, the order wrong, and no attempt to ask whether it was right. on making a complaint, no attempt to address the issue. i was left with the impression that it didnt matter, since im unlikely to return anyway. "
"my plane was delayed by several hours, and was prowling the terminal looking for a place to wait/relax/eat. of the many eating choices at the terminal het paleis was by far the best. great ambience, food and drink. prices ok, except for the beer which was expensive. "
"i arrive on saturday during lunch time at grand cafe restaurant. during this time, waiters are supposed to run everywhere and be busy. as i will have a long flight, i decide to have a good lunch and i always wanted to go to grand café as i often travel trough schipol airpo "
the worst burger at the highest price (20€) and with the slowest service (50 mins). very nice job. just because its in the airport and people come and go... if this kind of sub specie of restaurant was in any town of the world the number of clients would be zero. 
rude waiters with an attitude problem. slow service. i will have a beer elsewhere next time. i suggest other do that same.
food was ok. service was slow for an airport restaurant. waiter rude. but less stressed than food court. probably better to eat land side.
had dinner with friends. service was efficient and the food tasted good. the ribeye steak was well prepared and tender. dish lacked a good sous.
was asked to take a table. the waitress too ages to arrive by which time it was too late to order.  on top of that almost all the other places to eat were closing and wouldnt let us in. appalling.
more than ok if you adjust your expectations to the environment where youre in. service was fast and friendly. sufficent choice for a wide public.even the setting is ok and makes you forget youre only at an airport.
the restaurant is roomy and the interior of the restaurant is much above averag 
"this looked like a nice restaurant, but admittedly not particular impressive. the service was slow (the waiters simply had to much to do), the food the usual dutch style food without to much taste. we thought we had plenty of time but a the end we did not as we waited an unusual long time for the food from the kitchen. doubtful i will be back."
"as soon as we stepped foot in the cafe the staff were instantly rude as we asked if they had english menus. when we was ready to be served the lady completely ignored us. slow service for drinks. once our order arrived it wasnt pleasant for the eyes. both our dinners were cold and dont taste very nice. unfortunately we had to pay for food we didnt eat! not impressed!! over priced, rude, horrible place.. dont go !!!! "
"second time through the airport and thought we would try something different from our prior stop. our breakfast meals were average at best. it was quite a bit more expensive than the mediterranean sandwich shop next door. what it did offer was a more private dining experience. if you have the time to sit around for a while you might enjoy it better than next door, otherwise i would stick with the mediterranean place. "
"food nothing special, but could have worked for hungry tummies if it wasnt for the extremely poor service. all waitresses pouted and were not interested in our orders. when orders were delivered some of the sides were missing and they found it sooo annoying to go get it that they lied and said they didnt have any (other waitress supplied later at our request). would not recommend and will not return."
"if i have a stop over at schiphol with a connection to an eu city, i like to stop for a broodje kroket at  het paleis. the service is not always great, the food maybe not what you want/ like as an international traveller, but as a dutchman its like coming home, kroket & beer. decent breakfast as well. last time, august 16, i got good service. but again nothing compared to us standards, unfortunately. ( dutch people: it is the last ( or first) resort) to eat kroketten or bitterballen once you passed customs. i dont think there is a place to order this in the international area at schiphol. cheers and enjoy"
"went here for food before flying home and left most of my food.on the plate. i got ham and cheese.melt with chips. chips were cold and tasteless and toastie seemed dry. my boyfriend enjoyed his bitterballen. waiter wasnt very friendly.and threw our.cutlery at us, wasnt impressed.with this.place at all. "
"we have had good and poor experiences at this restaurant, it all seems to boil down to the waite "
cold food. overpriced. how can you serve cold chips or cold toasts ?  better go to starbuck and buy a muffin with coffe....
was travelling through schiphol a few weeks back and was delayed for a few hours so ate at the grand cafe. the staff were very warm and friendly and offered advice on the specials etc and the restaurant was extremely busy however every customer got 100% attention. the food was served quickly and was nice and tasty and if i am stuck in schiphol again i will be back.
"abysmal and slow service - their interpretation of caesar salad, by the way, is two lettuce leaves and a pile of cheese and mayonnaise - you would think an airport restaurant would be prompt and attentive but you almost have to trip these waiters as they walk past to get them to stop - if you pay with a credit card, youll have to walk up to the waiter station"
"i cant tell you anything about the cafe/restaurant, because there was no service at all. we waited for about 10 minutes and none of the waiters had time to take our order, even though they saw us sitting and gesturing. i guess we were in no-ones service area. go to bubbles! much better!"
"i did not have the lamb like a previous reviewer but the chicken satay was lifeless with a very salty satay sauce. i also did not appreciate that it has one of the airports smoking areas, an ambiance i would prefer not to have with food. the service however was very professional and friendly and the place had a buzz."
"1 totally disinterested waiter present, engaged with phone, not approachable for simple question. not only me but others aswell"
"i bought two small cheese baguettes, crisps and a bottle of water and it came to 24 euro which was really expensive."
too expensive for what you get. the coffee wasn’t good more like hot milk and the staff couldn’t tell me what was the flat white or the latte.
"everything seemed tasty with pleasant presentation, the ambience was good and spacious  clean and neat. the staff was friendly and served us efficiently. however the prices are way up there. check prices before you buy."
"i saw a mouse on 3 occasions, i reported the matter to the staff in bread and they informed me there were mice everywhere in the airport  - totally unacceptable"
made a mistake in the price... not eager to fix it and gave back the change in 5cents as a vengeance... top management skills there !!!!  in short avoid !!
"i don’t feel the need to add any further details, overpriced and stale. choose anywhere else to avoid disappointment."
"two very average ham paninis on disposable bags, two coffees in paper cups and one small bottle of water with no glass, all for €33! part of this was €6 for an extra shot in each coffee- that is €3 per shot into an already made coffee. also, if you asked for one shot less you did not get a €3 reduction. and to add insult to injury the coffee comes out of a push button machine and tastes crap. in the uk ‘bread’ is slang for money- the name sums them up well. don’t bother eating here."
"departures in schiphol is limiting for coeliacs. i was delighted to see this time that bread has gluten-free options. choice of ham or cheese sandwiches. alongside all of the nice and appetising looking normal sandwiches, the pre-packaged gf sandwiches looked weak. i went for cheese and was more disappointed than first impressions prompted. the bread was nice but a single slice of cheese and nothing else in the sandwich just made it a soggy disappointment. all the more frustrating as you got the bread right. just pure thoughtless not putting a proper filling inside. "
"40 euro for a ceaser salad , packet of crisps, a sandwich, a tea & a coffee! realise airport food is almost always over priced but thats just nuts! food nice and fresh but come on guys....thats just a rip off!!"
"pretty perfunctory offering here when you scrutinise it.....sandwiches are fresh and attractive and cold drinks nicely displayed on crushed ice, other than that rather underwhelming, expensive with somewhat indifferent service. it’s an airport so pretty much what you see is what you get!!"
i stopped here for lunch prior to my flight as it was located just past the exit of security. the selection of products was more limited than i expected but i was able to find a warm filled baguette to eat. the food was expensive but i had come to expect that in an airport (10 euros for a baguette and soft drin 
the food was good but staff ignore dirty tables. i was wiping mine and the staff member looked and kept on walking. every table piled with crumbs.
"tried a sandwich with egg mayo, bacon and avocado. it was really tasty and a good snack whilst waiting for my plane."
"the tables and chairs were covered in spills that had clearly been there for a while. when i asked the waiter to clean up, he wasnt sure where to find what he needed. after a long while he emerged with a wet towel. no disinfectant. im not sure hed ever wiped a surface before. he seemed new to the concep "
similar to pret a porter starbucks costa but not quite as good  service was slow and not well organised  panini was plain compared to others
bread as hard as a rock. two stars given as  staff swapped my boyfriends coffee as he accidentally put in pepper instead of sugar
"somewhere to stop for a light bite when in the airport. managed to get breakfast for 4 people for less than 40euros. the sandwiches at ok, nothing special. a nice cup of black coffee"
thought it would be good for a quick sandwich whilst passing through the airpo 
"waiting for our flight i purchased a coffee and cake, nothing special, food a bit bland, then i tried the fresh orange which was a bit tarty instead of the usual sweet.  needs market research to improve, ok if in a hurry though."
not worth going to. its a very busy place but didnt find the food good at all. nothing special. would have rather gone to mcdonalds.
i was very disappointed with the service at bread! the coke which i purchased was overpriced and had more water pumping into it than actual coke. also the hot chocolate we were given was just an empty cup with a sachet in it which was very weak and was not worth the money as it was very bland and felt like a low budget product.
"rude staff member , unhelpful , i would not  spend my hard earned money at this establishment again , i would go to the many other eating place where the staff treat you like a person and not an inconvenience ,"
"whilst i appreciate that 8am on a monday morning is rush hour, there is no excuse to put the slowest server on the tills and then not do anything about  "
"the fact that youre in amsterdam doesnt make a difference. if youre not picky about your food sitting out on the counter, or have a delicate palate, then this is an ok place to grab a bit "
"this place is okay for a quick bite, just dont expect great taste or reasonable prices! we had two glasses of orange juice, a caprese baguette, and a croissant. the orange juice was fresh and lovely and the only saving grace, because the bill certainly wasnt!"
"by far, this was the worst piece of pizza ive ever eaten.  it had absolutely no taste.  the tuna fish sandwich was just as bad.  try some other place in the airport to eat!"
"small bacon & egg sub - €6.25, 2 x juices - €11.50, small bottle of water €3.15. are your eyes watering? yes, its overcharging time at schiphzl airport! average fast food at top restaurant pric "
"youre flying from terminal h at schiphol - theres little to choose from in terms of food. the selection at bread looked tired, wilted or just over-cooked. the only item that was enjoyable was the green smoothy which was a blend of vegetables. i will give bread a miss on the next time through schiphol."
picked this place for breakfast from among the many choices at schiph 
classic overpriced airport fare. tastes okay. got two sandwiches and soft drinks for eur20. wont rush back any time soon.
had breakfast just now. simple bread preparations . nothing to shout about. no fancy ingredients. good choices of juices. vegetarian options available.
"i travel a lot and therefore i am used to the stupid prices at airports, however this place ranks as one of the worst for value for mon "
"no good for people having bread diet... plenty of panini, sandwich, toast, pizza kind of things... fresh juices are also available.."
ideal for a sandwich or snack but they dont appear to have enough staff to clear the tables when the place is busy
"schiphol airport is currently undergoing refurbishment work, so some restaurants have closed/relocated. looking for somewhere with space, i came across bread downstairs in lounge 3. as its name suggests, it specialises in bread - sandwiches, paninis and pizza. ingredients were fresh, but there was a wait to pay, tables werent cleared and the cutlery bins were not replenished. however when i asked staff for cutlery, they were quick to fetch it. you can access schiphol free wifi here."
"yes, they serve bread at bread!. nice, gimmicky decor. our paninis were okay, almost tasty. the plates were weird, gimmicky. all in all we might grab a panini here again. the service/checkout was kind of slow, but on a trip with layovers, who really cares..."
"the food was good, with quick service. but when i asked for more knives and forks - you need a metal one for pizza - i was waved to a second location. there were none there either."
"if you really have to eat at schiphol airport this is one of the best choices. nice sandwiches, pizza slices and panninis."
absolutely disgusting service. i 
"after eating my maceral sandwich, which was very nice, i noticed two mice running around under the tables. its absolutely disgusting and unhygenic. when i complained the staff seemed to know about the mice. i would not eat there again, who knows what has been running around all over the food?"
seafood restaurant in an airport before security. we were staying in a hotel near by and decided to try this place. it is fine. i ordered wrong and didnt enjoy my meal. my husband got the fish and chips and that was good. tables are bar height. staff was friendly. prices are fair for seafood in an airport. we would eat here again.
"great location in the plaza, near the front windows.  selection of fried and fresh seafood.  tasty and quick.  not a lot of space to sit, just takeaway and find a seat."
"i ordered a fish main course with a bottle of water and one espresso. the waiter prepared immediately the espresso before preparing the main course. when i noticed that i would have wanted to have the coffee after eating the fish, she just replied: “oh, sorry”, laughing, and without offering to prepare another at the right moment, unbelievable behaviour. quality of food horrible. i’ll remember this name next time i’ll travel to schiphol just in order to make the mistake to go there again."
"i always eat here when passing through schiphol, however on my latest trip i witnessed some disturbing hygience practices, namely a staff member emptying the bin with the food hygiene gloves still on, these werent changed before going back behind the counter to serve. they also seem to handle money with the gloved hands, why they dont have one gloved hand (the food hand) and one un-gloved hand (the money hand) and regularly wash their hands.? ive seen this in the uk too. people are generally unthinking and disgusting."
"not exactly the best seafood restaurant in holland. but if you need a raw herring fix as youre transiting through ams airport, then this is the only place in the airport you can get i "
"we had a quick dinner here at schiphol. i ordered fried shrimp with rice. the rice was good, which was rather rare in holland. the shrimp was on average but a bit saltier. in general it was a so-so experience."
"had a seafood salad which was tasty, also the oyster was good but too small than i expected. maybe little bit expensive."
"walking from the railway station to the departure hall we decided to take a dinner at this trendy restaurant. we ordered paella 2/5, ikan bali rice 3/5 and a salad 3/5. the service was friendly and efficient 4/5, the furniture trendy high seats and tables 3/ "
we were here yesterday waiting for our flights departure. decided to try the locals herring fish. the food is good though a bit on the high side. you must try the herring and their fish and chi 
really nothing special but quite ok. they offer a quite wide selection of different seafood dishes.  we tried their lunch box and sushi and it was ok.
"in the mood for some seafood, but tired and not interested in a major dinner, we thought this might have some good, fresh offerings without taking a lot of time. it wasnt bad, but more fast food than specialty spot."
"i stopped here for a quick bite before heading on to amsterdam. the service was slow and i waited for over 20 minutes for the food to be ready, despite there being hardly any costumers. the food was nothing special and the salmon was not quite done. i dont think ill be back, theres plenty of other restaurants around to choose from."
"the food is typically dutch, was cooked fresh and was well present "
"i go here often during business office. the staff is friendly, fish is good and the prices are fair for airport standards. would recommend to go here for an affordable lunch or dinner at the airport."
"the crab spread sub was a-okay wasnt the greatest but thats just my taste. a different sauce would have been nicer. the squid rings were quite oily and they were so thin, not much squid and a lot of batter but portion was big. my boyfriend got cod on its own with no chips and it was quite pricey at almost € "
"too expensive, we bought two small fried fish and paid € 15 for it........ € 7.50 per piece for 6 pieces per tray kibbeling"
"there are a number of food places in the amsterdam airport, but this was different. it is a restaurant specifically aimed at providing fresh seafood. i ordered a homemade salmon sandwich and that was pretty good. i would definitely come here again, however it is definitely too expensive. it really depends if you want seafood so much you would pay for the price they offer!"
"everybody is prepared to pay a bit more at any airport (liminal spaces and all), but at happy seafood the price goes way overboard. we had the so-called big portion of kibbeling (deep-fried battered fish). on the plus side, this is kibbeling made from true cod, rather than the cheaper type of white fish often used. on the minus side, a big portion, which in the rest of the netherlands will get you around 300g of kibbeling, at happy seafood is here at most 150g, perhaps less — but at more than double the price! sometimes you pay for the nice seating, but thats emphatically not the case here: the seating area only has small, high tables with barstools that seem to be designed to get people to move on as quickly as possible. at the risk of ending with a terrible pun: at happy seafood, the foods good, the rest is fishy."
"we ordered an eel roll, packed in a small box with plastic cover. the taste was reasonable because you could taste the smokyness of the eel, but the wrap was too soft and the veggies were all mushy. 2 small rolls were almost 8 euros, which is very expensive."
i walked from airport to avoid eat some “airport food” and following the hotel ranking. i tasted the salmon that was delicious but the servi 
"nice place, pretty good food. watch out for the recommended for two persons menu item. it’s way not enough for two (price is, quantity isn’t) the extra burger was needed to complete the meal."
"in europe tips are not the main portion of income, but tonight, i dinned alone and another stranger from same country sat alone next to me. we struck an engaging conversation. we converged to 1 table and paid our respective bills while finishing our beverages. we were asked to move to the bar bc they needed to seat others waiting. many empty tables around and waiter, balraj asked us to move to bar area. we did and 12 min later…still empty seats. as a diamond with hilton, i may switch to marriott bc of service…or lack there of…"
front of house service was brusque and off hand when we asked to be moved from a very large and noisy group area.  took ages to get out 1st course and even longer for the 2nd course. food was bland. a very impersonal experience.
stayed at the hilton the night before our flight home so decided to have dinner here in the hotel. appetizers and entrees were good but nothing special or outstanding. think we could have had just as good a meal or even better at one of the many restaurants in the airport mall and for less money.
"stayed at the hilton during a layover, decided to stay local for dinner. unfortunately a very poor experienc "

"this restaurant is very interesting place to review because it sits in a classification between being clearly preferred and feature restaurant of an international chain hotel and also, perhaps, it wants to have its own identity. having read some of the other reviews on this site, i was expecting the food to be stronger than it was based on my two opportunities to eat he "
"i ate dinner here earlier this week during a layover at the hilton schiphol airport (this is their on-property restaurant). overall, its a great restaurant with lovely food, a nice atmosphere, and seats where you can watch the chefs/cooks do their thing. id easily increase my rating to 4-5 stars if it werent for our server, niki. i say server because she only visited our table 4 times during the evening; to bring us menus, to re-fill our water, to bring the dessert menu (which we had no interest in given her poor service) and to bring our bill. i will say hats off to the rest of the team, who took our orders and brought our meals, as well as checked on us to ensure all was ok. niki did none of these. she was simply horrendous and if you choose to eat here, avoid sitting in her section."
"the bowery is the upscale restaurant of the schiphol airport hotel. it serves expensive but very good quality lunch and dinner dishes. using high quality and local sustainable ingredients. regrettably during a busy lunch hour it was seriously understaffed leading to the ball being dropped ... cutlery forgotten, food coldish, slow with the bill. atmosphere also a bit unrelaxed with many conference lunch eaters coming and going. staff managed to remain friendly despite the pressures. "
we both went for the asian menu selection. i had the beef and my friend had the sticky chicken both of which were very good. i ordered a bottle of rose - which was very nice but once our glasses were poured the bottle was taken away. it was never topped up unless i requested it from the waiter despite having an empty glass for over 10 minutes. we had almost finished the bottle - about 4cms left in bottom when he took it away and brought us a new bottle. i said i wanted the remainder of our bottle of wine not a new one and he replied that he had thrown it away as they never serve the last drop of wine due to sediment! i have never had this with a bottle of rose. maybe with a red. so i felt we were cheated out of a glass of wine! it’s the principal not the cost. so be aware when ordering wine here. 
as we were stranded passengers we felt slightly segregated from other guests because it was a free service! the food wasn’t great compared to the bar food we also had during our stay! was almost like we had “leftovers” however the food that guests were eating looked amazing as we walked through to our buffet 
"have you ever been to one of those restaurants where you pick up the menu and after scanning and re-scanning it, you think, actually im not really sure i fancy any of this? id just like something simple, easy-to-understand and comfortin "
"had my breakfast here for 5 days. typical same menu every single day. lunch a little variety. really, not impressive at all. the good thing, staff are nice, warm and courteous. "
"the restaurant claims to serve the best burger in town. well.. they dont. if they wanna claim anything, it might be worst burger in town. the burger was hard and rubbery, the tomato and gherkin were almost frozen, the bacon far from crispy and the taste almost chemical. after trying everything separate, it was clear that all products used were far from good. with b-quality its hard to make the best burger. staff was friendly but quite inexperienced. and way too much hassle: unfolding the menu, introducing them selves, asking whether we want the drinks menu on the table or not, the bill in a little tin.... a concept can be nice but this is too much for our taste. we also tried the mushroom croquettes (yuk!), the gyozo and other things and nothing made us very happy. they could do so much better. and with their prices they should do better. "
staff is friendly. food is taste good but a little bit pricey. burger is recommend. please make sure staff is put a right room number on the bill.
food was good but staff attitude poor. at peak times staff tends to be very hectic and forgets many orders if you come with a group of more than 5 people. inattentive and insensitive to customers.
ordered still - gave sparking. ordered medium well - gave rare. but worst - husband ordered seafood bisque - gave some kind of chicken soup instead.... and no takeaway allowed of leftovers if u dont finish - never again 
"whether you dine alone or with a 3 [as i did] it is really comfortable. staff is knowledgeable, wines are tasty and all three starters that we ordered were up to expectation. the main course however was not. the nasi goreng had not enough flavor and was not indonesian enough. too bad, this could be a great dish on the menu. but, there is enough to choose from so hopefully other dishes are more tasteful. for sure a place to return to."
"staff was friendly and welcoming. some issues with the service but nothing serious. food was only average, i honestly was expecting little bit better for the price. pretty standard hotel quality, nothing really wrong with that."
"as other reviewers have noted, service is spotty. it took more than ten minutes to get any drinks on my table. i saw several patrons actually get up from their tables to go ask for their checks. fortunately i brought along something to read. food was ok, but not outstanding. "
"we visited here on a sunday, it was very quiet indeed. now i know wh "
"bright (almost too bright), airy and welcoming restaurant in the schiphol hilton. exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. swift, attentive (tending towards too attentive....this is a fine line guys!) service. ate dinner and breakfast here recently. food beautifully presented. dim sum, excellent. nasi goreng very bland. the prawn (tempura style) was rubbery, cold and undercooked. the coating soggy....bit unfair to raise this now since i didnt complain at the time and allow problem to be rectified, but notice this wasn´t an isolated case. breakfast was very good. appreciated those small touches....coffee brought in large thermos....orange juice served and topped up....one of the lovely staff tempted us with warm pancakes brought to table. may i suggest seating larger groups away from couples? we fled a raucous group of men placed next to us. sorry....do not do loud in a morning."

"the food was good, not exceptional. but very convenient, as i was staying in the hotel and the price of the food was reasonable for a 5 star hotel."
"the hotel is very nice and we were looking forward to an equally nice meal after a very long day of international travel. we arrived at 9pm. the restaurant was not busy, but we had to wait ten minutes for a table. that was our first sign that things would not go well. finally, we were seated at a table that was not dressed. a couple who arrived after us, received menus, water and a greeting from a waiter before us. we waited and waited. nothing. after ten minutes, i called over for a waiter. we received menus and had the table set. we quickly decided on our choices, but again, no waiter. he had disappeared. we waited so long that the couple next to us were served bread and their drinks. there is an open kitchen where we watched a frantic chef fussing over dishes. he was expending so much energy, but it seemed misguided due to the bad service and so few tables to serve. i called over the hostess once again so we could order. she took our ordered and explained that there had been a delayed flight and the restaurant was crunched trying to prepare dinner for the passengers. there was a buffet already set up for the delayed flight. it was a poor excuse. our poor service was due to a disorganized staff and lack of professionalism and experience. surly, an international airport hotel should have well trained staff prepared to serve tired travelers. no one comes to the airport just to eat out. everyone there is traveling, jet lagged and wanting to eat and move on. i ordered miso salmon and my husband ordered a hamburger. my salmon sat under a hot lamp for nearly ten minutes while the chef fussed over stylizing plates. the salmon was overly sweet and over cooked. we were so annoyed by the entire experience we couldnt wait to get out of there. we would stay at the hotel again, but not eat at the restaurant."
ok hotel is ok a la hilton bit far from terminal advertised closer its a serious walk all the way at the e 
average breakfast and dinner. good value for price since breakfast is juts 15 euros and you can have continental buffet and fresh made omelet.
"this place is fine if you are staying in the hotel, but i wouldnt recommend it otherwise. breakfasts here were good with lots of options. service was friendly, if a bit disorganised,"
"the quality of the meals was good. i liked tom kah kai. it was a little bit salty though. steak tartar was excellent. my wife ordered asian wrap, which was not the one she expected. the problem is waitresses. they were very nice, but not efficient and not professional. they socialize each other and do not pay much attention to customers. a lady next to us asked for the dessert menu, but nobody came back to take order for 10 min. not surprisingly she just left. they need to be more trained and the ms ages should watch how they are doing for customers. we did not get bread and some au de voir despite the fact that we ordered a bottle of wine."
"this is the restaurant of the hip and fun schipol airport hilton. the interior is modern and trendy, but for some inexplicable reason the waiting staff are dressed as farme "
"i was taken to my table but then ignored for the next 10mins, until i finally got someones attention to provide me with a menu. why dont they leave a menu with you once you reach the table? the codfish had little flavour but the accompanying bread was delicious. disappointing."
"presentation was nice but the taste was very average. service was friendly and efficient. they are still in the startup, do plenty room to improve."
"the host was friendly, took a long time to get a menu and bead provided was really great as was the butter etc this was the go "
"i was intrigued by the write up about this restaurant, so i asked for a seat where i could watch the kitchen in action. interesting, but didnt see all that much. while steady business, i was most disappointed with poor service. i waited at least 15 minutes for my plate to be cleared and then another 1/2 hour for my server to bring my check! the menu choices are mediocre. the fresh roasted veggies were greasy and underwhelming. would probably take a cab to eat elsewhere next time considering the prices, selection and service. there is an amazing sized hamburger on the menu for the hungry person, though!"
"great food selection on menu, and terrifically cooked. only negative is the very slow wait between courses. fifteen minutes between ordering and soup arriving; then ten minute wait for main course, and then fifteen minute wait to receive dessert (in fact had to remind the staff each time to bring the next course) - all this perhaps because the restaurant (and the hotel itself) are new (opened in december 2015) and still undergoing shake-down."
"we decided to discover bowery for a lunch. the place is nice, with a great decoration and atmosphere. nevertheless the service was a complete disaster! arrogant, unprofessional, more than 40 min to get dishes... bref unacceptable for hilton and a nice moment which turn into a nightmare!"
this really is a pathetic and pretentious place. the worst was the very agressive pushing by the waiter to leave a tip on the credit card. upselling the (good) house wine as if it was something very special was plain silly.
service was mediocre. asked for something light because i was not hungry and got a big heavy slab of mea

especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"

"let me start by saying that possibly the covid times are not making it easier to provide a 1 star michelin experience, but i nevertheless have been to a few lately that didnt have this level of experien "
"we went to this restaurant a few times twenty years ago & didnt think much of it then. we had given it a miss ever since then but decided to go there last week to see whether things have improved. it is a nice, quiet restaurant set in a small shopping street. we had a three-course meal with tea & chocolates at the end. unfortunately, things havent improved very much in the last twenty years. the food was mundane without any wow factor. even if it did not have a michelin star, the food would have been described as ordinary at best - having a michelin star made it that much worse. the service was pleasant & the restaurant was full, so perhaps it was me that didnt like it. there are many restaurants in the area, both with and without michelin stars, which are infinitely better than cheval blanc, in my opinion. it is a great pity, as the restaurant is located near where we live & hence very easy for us to get to, but i think we will have to wait another twenty years to see whether there is any improvement!"
"we had the deschamps chef menu, and we were just disappointed by the whole experience. the creations are (seem) to simple for a restaurant of this level, not exciting at all. there was also this figure that kind of runs the place, he was a bit annoying, we didnt feel very comfortable with him arou "
"lovely dinner, though seated very close together.  menu was nice, good execution, wasn’t wowed we’ve had a lovely dinner, waiters were nice, all was clean."
"we had the 6 course tasting menu, everything was just pretty much ok, nothing spectacular, nothing to remember. i guess prices are fair"
"the food was good, but the restaurant is very noisy (bad accoustic). the room is small and packed with tables, which makes it less cozy. i had a draft on my neck from the air conditioning."
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the saté was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brûlée very good."

"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend €120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.
"restaurant is very conveniently located for locals to walk to dinner rather than drive. food of decent quality (but would not use the superlatives i see in other reviews), which for us was what we where looking for. price was on the high side for the achieved level of the foo "
a small restaurant in the middle of the mainstreet of the village. make a reservation. good food list with meals you expect. the meat dish liver is perfect. ask for a table not to close to the entrance.
"i went here with my family, it was good. theres a lot of space to sit and theres a lot of choice in food. it tastes good."
"had a family dinner with all ages involved. then this is really a nice place as everbody can find something to eat - drink. also jointly exploring and sharing is fun. food is good and service correct. perhaps the set up with tables an chairs is a bit basic, missing some warm ambient."
"very decent lunch platter, very big portions. terrace is nice with shade or sunshine options. service wasn’t the quickest, but overall it was okay."
"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staff’s eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying ‘dat meen je niet!’ she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long she’d like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadn’t made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was ‘oer’ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though i’d ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that he’d promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.
"great food, friendly staff. little things that could be better. paper towels dispenser in toilet stall is empty. yes, but we put a paper roll in a child seat outside the bathrooms. uh, yes, that workshop, but. "
we liked the food here in the past but the last five times weve ordered here we had to call multiple times to see why the food was delayed. on two occasions they had not processed the order. today they also forgot to include the most expensive article in the order and treated us rudely when we asked our money bac

nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
"its as if the staff walk around actively trying to avoid getting into contact with customers. ive waited for 10 minutes, 3 servers walked by and none of them even said as much as hello. ive walked away from their terrace for the second time in a few weeks now. this used to be a fantastic restaurant. good food, good ambiance. sadly, they seem to have slipped.

"the menu is traditional, offers a fairly good selection of dishes. staff is friendly and efficient. although the restaurant is fairly large, the restaurant is divided into smaller sections creating an intimate atmosphere."
"we didnt really want to have dinner at the van der valk hotel but on mondays a lot of restaurants in assen are closed. someone told us the food at the hotel was really okay, which is what made us decide to have dinner the "
in this part of europe hotel restaurants are more interested in giving you a filling meal that is good value for money rather than delighting the senses. meals in the van der valk hotel assen are served in a large charmless room with the window seats commanding views of the motorway and industrial estate but then no one would come here for a culinary adventure or a romantic tryst. 
"after going past most restaurants in town, that were closed, a bank holiday, we finally thought about van der valk. this used to be known for cheap food and large portions, (trucker portions they would be called), but not very fine, dining, just simple good meals, to everyones taste. but since they were a hotel, we were sure they would be open. we went there and the restaurant was nice, entirely newly decorated, well upgraded from the family rooms, it used to look like. also the running stressed students were gone and the staff seemed less temporary and very friendly and professional. the restaurant was full. as we did not have a reservation, we were lead to a side restaurant, which looked like a buffet restaurant, as it had a huge (empty) fixed buffet facility. we ordered, and though the restaurants were all full, it took longer than normal there, but still came in a relatively timely manner. the menu has become more a la mode. we ordered and enjoyed our meal, but all concluded, that it was better they stick to their simple good meals instead of making complicated mixes of different cultures in one plate and nothing really having a nice authentic taste. also gone were the large varieties of vegetables and potatoes : boiled, fried, mash and french fries, and though not ordered the mayonnaise ( a must with chips on a dutch table) was charged separately, which seems odd for a facility like this. prices had also gone up. the décor is nice and i believe this is a good place for a family meal ( with kids), on the move or other reason to have a quick meal, but no longer, an inexpensive one, but then, the netherlands, compared to germany, france, and the uk, is very overprices when it comes to dining out in general, we believe."
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25€, and salad 9.75€. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"we took two burgers on the lunch menu. bad meat, bad bread, almost no salad. non smiling service. not a great place. though it is well located."
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."

i asked some vegetarian options among a rubbishy pre set tapas meal. after 45 minutes scouring through random pieces of meat i found 2 meager options. luckily the waiters gave me enough time to find it before being able to serve the next round.

"the restaurant has got a nice terrace and plenty of indoor seating. menu is mainly deep-fried food. the actual cheeseburger i got was greasy, tasteless and rather expensive."
"good atmosphere, good service, reservations recommended on friday and saturday. not a bad eating experience, my wife had the pork kabob with ribs, which were good. meats were served on a bed of mashed potatoes with bits of spinach leaf, well presented. meal came with french fries, a salad and another potato dish (not baked). couldn’t quite determine the spice used on the second potato dish, but wasn’t to my liking. a baked, with sour cream and chives, potato would have been better. i had the ribeye, which, unfortunately was not available, but the house was gracious enough to substitute a t- bone at the same price. t-bone was a healthy size, and cooked to my request, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. questioned the waitress and found out that the meats have very little fat content, presumably the reason for being chewy. my recommendation to the cook would be to use a bit of meat tenderizer in the future. also wouldn’t hurt to marinade the steak in either a1 or hp sauce for a few hours for some additional flavor. had i ordered the t-bone at its full price i would have been disappoint "
"we were just the 2 of us, my brother and me. he had the spicy ribs and i had the steak. the steak was fine, it was of good quality but the pepper sauce looked and tasted like it was the kind where you just add water and serve. terrible. the vegetables were virtually non-existent and pretty blan "
"good for dutch standards. its a small restaurant, cozy and intimate for a romantic dinner. they have decent meats and a good menu in general."
"having been here a few times, i was surprised that the restaurant was listed no. 22 of restaurants in emmen when it could be a lot better then that. almost all ingredients are there, but the right recipe has not been found yet. location is not bad, and the place has a very nice feel to it. we were sitting outside in a spacious aria at the front of the restaurant. drinks were served quickly. so, the setting was there. but what was missing ? hmm perhaps that the food was just good, nothing special. meat ( rib roast ) a bit dry, and the tomato soup was almost a diluted pasta sauce. too creamy and cheesy. but all in all, not bad at all. the service was kind and helpful but during dinner they left the table unattended for too long of periods. i guess the place just needs a bit more professionalism. paying a bit more attention to details. taking away used plates quicker, and come by a bit more often to check for drinks. so, could be better, but 22nd is certainly not deserved !"
sorry to say this but the food just was not go 
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
"well, the title says a lot, doesnt it. perhaps im being a bit negative, but after visiting them 3 times i keep getting the feeling that i should not come again. one time i was there i requested that i would not like a scoop of chocolate ice cream in my trio of ice, but rather have an extra vanilla instead.. i was gobsmacked when they told me that i could only order what the menu said !.. ( still cant get my head around that ) last time i had no choice as the other restaurants were fully booked, so we just sat there outside, waiting for someone to come by.. ....... which took a while... and when someone came, we asked for the menu, ............ which never came, so we collected it ourselves. and after reading that for a kids menu under 12 y.o. the child would have to prove it by an id, thats when i stood up and wen "
"the location in the center of emmen is excellent. nice and cosy restaurant. the food is ok, but not special. service is good."
well its okay but not one of the better restaurants in emmen. there are better options for a lower price.
old outdated restaurant with an outdated menu. we were the only ones in the restaurant and when i ordered a double espresso she gave me two espresso on top of eachother. so that isnt professional at all and the prices are way to high for the food and service you get here.
"went there for a drink and a snack. chicken wings were horrible, covered in batter. its oke for a drink but do realise that toilet access is pretty bad, you have to use a steep stairway!"
"we placed an order but we got unfortunately the wrong order (their mistake) after a phone call with not a very friendly man they said they would come back and give the new order once arrived they requested extra payment for the correct order .. so we eventually payed twice, we are very unsatisfied. wouldnt recommend this place to anyone"
"i must say that because i was the only one who did not enjoy my meal, reflects more on me than the hotel. having said that, i had the duck and was not pleased with the taste. i wish there had been more choices on the menu, perhaps some chicken. i also did not like the vegetarian options for my sister, as she cannot eat mushrooms. she had the special which she guessed would be whatever was left in the fridge, as it was the chefs creation - and she was correct. however she enjoyed it. my mother enjoyed her sirloin, and my grandparents enjoyed their food too. so maybe it was just me! the staff was very attentive and helpful, especially with my aging grandfather. i was not left impressed by the menu choices, but otherwise it was a pleasant evening."
more a bar then resturant. had carpaccio which was placed on buttered bread. first time eaten that way and i guess there is a reason. it does not work.
"went there with husb. and littleone for quick dinner. place is enormous. food nothing special for an all you can eat but this makes that there is something for everyone. if you like the all you can eat concept go there. if you don’t, keep away from this place. it is as simple as that."
poor attempt at running a buffet restauran 
"indeed you can choose from a lot of dishes, but the quality of food is below avera "
the restaurant is really spacious and can fit a lot of people inside it. the food is ok but the diversity can be more( in my eyes it just have a bit more dishes than wok). the dessert menu has a lot of choices.
"run by unpleasant people, average food at inflated prices, very hot inside, no ventilation or aircon, chinese production kitchen is not something you want to see, if you want to eat there, it will put you off forever, drinks not included, most staff try hard, but really, there are other similar cheaper places to go, inclusive drinks and a more pleasant environme "
"service is average, but nice. food is average nothing more nothing less. competition would be great for this restaurant i presume. asperges were ok but not really good, fries and wine average, everything is average here. i think they are great for large groups and tourists, for great they really have to make a huge step.

place looks well decorated and compared to the past the long cues are solve 
"the food is not well cooked, very few dishes. last time i ate raw potatoes and a disgusting cake. better eat in another place."
visited la place this afternoon 
"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
"most uninterested, unfriendly and bored ppl i’ve ever encountered in a service establishment! it looks like they have been forced to work he "
this is not a subway wort 
can’t describe the lack of efficiency here. i sat at the table for 1h with my family waiting. what did we order? 4 simple paninis and 2 soups. the amount of people during this hour that decided not to wait and left was impressive (also the trays with drinks brought to empty tables and back into the fridge after being re closed). for our drinks we”only “ needed to wait for 30min. i must say that the food was great. or we were just starvin 
"the croque monsieur was reheated and absolutely dreadful. have been before, but now they have started reheating the food i will never go back"
first of all the menu promised a bread-sommelier to help with the decision on what type of bread would compliment your topping. the only question we got was white or brown and later they came to me that they didn’t even had brown bread. and just fyi at this moment there were 5 tables and 4 waiter 
"the first impression was not so good. despite hardly any guests in the cafe there were many dirty, not cleared tables. also one chair at our table was dirty. as we were hungry, we decided to give it a try. we ordered a full lunch with hot meals and drinks plus tap water for the kids. however, the restaurant refused to serve the tap water and came with small bottles for each of the kids. why is unclear: we were spending enough so why no tap water for kids? why wasting bottles if tap water in holland is superb? we did not get a good answer: only ‘company policy’. the food itself varied from good (salmon, ‘rundvleeskroketten’) to mediocre (pancakes, fish and chips). service was quick. when we paid (unfortunately you cannot pay at the table but need to go to a till) we were very surprised to see that we had to pay €0,50 for ketchup. the fries came with mayo, so why not change for ketchup? in conclusion: not a good experience. will not come back. "
we had fish and chips and chicken saté. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"too much pepper in the burger, fries tasted a bit like they were made with old oil, but the spare ribs were juicy and tender. nice outdoor seating."
"we ate good steaks only we received only one serving of french fries instead of two. some people who were alone received one serving of french fries same portion we received. it was not fair. then we finished our food, the waitress came & we asked why only one portion. i forgot what she said. just like discrimination because we were the only brown people that time. she asked if we wanted another portion of french fries. ah ah... what an excuse!...we were finished already. then she asked!!!the place is good & food to "

"service was good with friendly staffs. starters such as mushroom with cheese, goat cheese, onion soup and smoked salmon, were excellent, they smelled really good. main dish had a reasonable portion. meat was good. fish was tasty. if you arent in a hurry for dinner, this place can be your choice because it takes a bit time to get food delivered to your table."
"we were with the four of us. we told the restaurant we were going to the theater after dinner. we had two hours planned for dinner but after one and half hour we were still waiting for our main course. we told the waiter we were concerned , but that didnt help much... we did make it in time but it was only just."
"we first ordered drink and then lunch. after seeing most of customers got their food, we asked a staff (there were only 2 staffs) about our food. the staff looked blank and said she did not take our orders. unbelievable!!! she looked into her note and found out it was her. it took in total 45 minutes to get lunch. food was delcious though and restaurant looked cozy though. "
"this place offers a 3 course menu with different options for a good price, eur. 14,50. next to the dinner menu they offer an extensive beverage menu with some nice cocktails. the place itself is very nice and attractive however the employees are not service minded at all. as a customer you have to ask them for a menu, ask them to take your order, ask them to clean the table etc. that is sad seeing how beautiful the place is and the potential it has. you can have a nice time there for dinner and lots of fun drinking after your meal but the service doesnt motivate you."
"service in general was fine, altough one of the guys forgot that i ordered an extra beer. but one of the dishes we ordered totally did not match the menu. it should have tomatoes, bascilicum and ..., but it had totally different vegetables and a bell pepper sauce - which was for sure not mentioned. next to that, the dish was super saulty. so we were nit so happy about the food, we did get a discount when we mentioned it though."
"normal bar, trendy inside, but very poor waitering. more then once i ordered my drinks at the bar which they would bring to the table and then waited more then 20 minutes. the bill is also qwuite often a surprise..."
waited a long time to be served. then waited a long time for my drink. when i ordered my meal and second drink it never showed so i just got up and left. visit lelystad regularly for work but wont go here again.

my husband and i thought this would be a nice place to have something to drink. the waitress asked if we had a reservation but it was not a problem and said we choose a table in the back. i sat down and husband went to the toilet. i was waiting to be asked what i wanted to drink. but was totally ignored by several waiters they looked at me and continued talking amongst each other and one them even went to the bar and had audacity to have a drink at the bar. only when my husband returned the waiter came to set the table and take the order. just to make it clear i am dutch-indian origin and my husband is real dutch therefore caucasian. i assume i was not good enough to be recognized as a person and only my husband was as he is white skinned. so sad that that there are still people like this in the world.
"the setting is cool, that is what invited us in but now we know bett "
nice place with lovely views. spacious and bright restaurant with some outside space looking up to a harbou 
"this restaurant is a short walk from batavia outlet. it overlooks lelystad harbour and rather nice both in summer when the terrace is open and in the autum. the waitresses are friendly. it has a modern ambiance. the waitress accidently split the beer which did splatter the jacket. they offered to pay the dru cleaning bill. uitsmiljters were ordered which were fine. unfortunately the menu for lunch is rather small and not much to choose from. the plus point is if you park in the underground parking, they give you a parking card to drive out instead of paying the normal parking fee. definitely better than eating at the outlet,"
"ive been here a couple of times now and i truly believe it is a hit or miss situation here which largely depends on the mood of the staff that day. we popped by today for a latte and a cup of coffee. today wasnt our day, staff was cranky and eager to dismiss us as soon as possible. in addition for the prices i would expect a real latte. this was a machine pumped watered down cup of something that somewhat resembled a latte in taste. hubbys coffee was at least better than sludge he said. so in general if you want to pay too much for a limited menu, crappy service with a nice view then you should pop by de rede. will we go again? oh probably as location is ideal. ps dont even bother asking if any of their coffee drinks can be altered slightly, it all comes pre-made in a machine."
the food was nothing special. only the sateh was pretty good. waiters forgetfing the drinks and took almost 30 minutes before someone came for ordering the food. it was not very busy.
"the second rede we tried after rede in dronten. its location is nice, with view of water and boats. food is good as usual. the service is great. we always have good time at de rede."

we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.

"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajé."
i visited this restaurant while staying in lelystad. i had some mixed feelings on my vis 
this harbor restaurant is a bit out of the way but the tasty dishes are a good reason for the 5 min drive out of the city centre. the interior is surprisingly modern and cozy. the staff is friendly but needs some more experience.
an averadge restaurant but excellent for having a drink and/of as snack while staying the day on the nearby beach
"what can i say about this chain restaurant?, all the same concept. one is bigger than the other. here, they have a playground for the kids, big terrace. we had a good veggie burger for the lunch."
"what can you say that has not been said before. the same awful food in the same awful surroundings. use only in desperation - better quality food can be bought at either of the two petrol stations just along the road. better still, continue on the a6 direction amsterdam for just 5 minutes and enjoy a break at haje."
honestly i have been to better. the burgers are probably the worst i have had in a long time but hey at least it is food
"its just another mac, nothing special about it. the only good thing is that there is at least something to eat while youre on the mo "
"we went to this place for what we thought would be a quick meal. we ended up leaving without having our bite to eat. the cook seemed totally lost! he would look at the orders and just read them over and over again until finally he seemed to understand what he needed to do. and the place wasnt crowded or anything. many people were just having coffee. we dont know if the food is any good, but service is terrible!!!"
"ok pancakes after visiting the batavia ship, or shopping. the service could be better (forgot about one of the dishes), but the pancakes were ok overall, with interesting topping choices. combines an ice cream shop."
"i received the wrong order and told them not to bother - and accepted it. unfortunately, my partner received his meal 15 minutes later - burned. he sent it back to the kitchen. so instead of having lunch together, we ate in tur "

"nice place for lunch or dinner with family and friends. rather good choice of menu and drinken, game room for children. friendly personnel and fast service (however it was rather busy on saturday evening)."
"just outside of batavia stad is this restaurant with a terrace shielded of from the wind, great! food is ok, but not really special. the menu lacks imagination. service is ok, but waitresses prefer to talk with each other instead of looking at the customers"
"the place looks nice but dirty, there were spiderweb everywhere. the service is very bad, we waited long time for our drinks and ofcourse for the dishes too. after we waited around one hour for a lasagna and a caeser salad, we asked the waiter if he can prepare the food for take away. we received a very burned lasagna and a so called caeser salad wich was not caeser at all. we recommend to avoid the place!"
"the food here is fine, and not long waiting time. it is located outside of the mall, so it is fairly relaxed and quiet, which is nice."
"it is a nice place to sit and rest your legs while shopping. service was fast when we ordered lunch and drink. food was good. however, staffs could pay more attention to customers because we tried to order more drink and nobody really looked at us."
"terrible place, ive ordered a sirloin steak without butter. the first time they brought this dish to my friend, although he asked for a ribeye steak and the waiter told him explicitly that this is his dish. after the waiter understood he made a mistake, he ordered a new sirloin dish and brought it with butter although it was explicitly requested without. to summarize do not get near this place. horrible food with bad service from unprofessional team."
"had a coffee here as a cycle trip stop. service ok, drink fine, nothing special, nothing wrong here."
"liked watching people and the town hall from the terrace, price/quality was just ok, nothing special"
terrible service. arrived with my family. my son ordered food which they served after 10 mins. i ordered food which they failed to serve at all. after 45 mins i asked where food was and they said they had forgotten to put the order through. no apologies no sorry just a shrug of the shoulders. i asked for the drinks bill and they never even offered a discount. the staff (male) were appalling. they didn’t seem to have a clue what was going on. i’ve had family in leeuwarden for 36 years. i will definitely not be visiting this restaurant again!!!
"we went with the family for a lunch. the menu is a bit simple. some sandwiches, omelettes, croques and croquettes... for vegetarians no other options than a sandwich goatcheese. or order things without the ham or bacon common.... pls think of something el "
"this was a great place to break our journey en route from groningen to alkmaar. the cafe is situated beside the canal near to a bridge festooned with flowers. inside the wonderful 1930/40’s decor seemed unchanged. we sat near the water taking in all sorts of activity such as an elderly lady in in traditional dress addressing a small group of people and a group of young men singing for anyone who cared to listen. the leeuwarden is to be capital city of culture 2018, could be lots going on…"
ordinary bar/pub. i havent tried their dinner but nachos and fried cheese. cheese was quite nice although nachos had only little cheese.
came to this cafe for coffees and found that the members of staff were very unpleasant and the service was not good!
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
now this is a really relaxed place very casual they have excellent food and every week they have a changing menu. always friendly people and in the summertime you can even sit outside. not too many tables so during rush hours it might be handy to make a reservation.
"i found this restaurant to be of a reasonable standard. the staff were friendly and efficient and the food provided was of a good standard. i had lamb which i thought was a little over cooked, however , to be fair there were 28 of us eating having not booked. i would recommend a visit ."
"one of the few places open for breakfast (most places don’t open till noon). no eggs here, but good coffee, tea, hot chocolate. we had granola with yoghurt and fruit, and some pancakes. good!"
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that ‘it’s an old hotel’ ‘you can leave if you wish’. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: “so my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink 
"this is a stunningly designed restaurant in an old post office. i was dining alone and sitting at a long sharing table. the menu is deceptively big but different dishes for different times of the day, so the choice per meal is small and all tast "
the choices in the menu were very small. if you don’t eat meat or fish you’re not able to eat here. fries didn’t taste well. and the didn’t had the beer on the menu. bad experience.
grand cafe post plaza  in leeuwarden is a nice place to eat and drink. .........clean and cozy.... the price is good and staff are nice and quick service
"after waiting for ten minutes on a dirty table, that was not cleaned yet, we did ask the girl if we could order, she took the tip from the previous people and walked away with our order, but left the table full with the dirty cup "
the place is cozy and very enjoyable with the cat 
"went for an evening meal, an overcooked so called dry aged steak was 67 euros which they insisted could be shared by 2 people but wasnt, i had a chicken breast which cost £30 euros, nicely cooked but not worth that price as there were no vegetables and they brought a small dish of chips which was enough for one person but there were 5 of us, if we wanted more they were ext "

"it’s a great place when you have a lot of time, the food takes ages before it’s served. the staff is nice."
"we had a very large group and only about half of our group enjoyed their meals. we recommend the aged steak, bread starter, and the lava cake (with caramel!). we do not recommend the eel or other fish starter, bravette, or pasta sala "
basic food presented nicely. would not recommend for the food but the place and location is great. i think you can go here for drinks and snacks.
"a friend who lives here wanted to treat me to a special meal. love the outdoor seatings, service & decors especially the location in the old prison. we had the 4 dishes tasting menu. it was 3 meat and a fish dish. loved the fish and the duck but the starter a ‘steak tartar with raw egg york’ was a no for me. i eat everything except ‘raw meat’, i don’t mind it medium rare but raw with a raw egg york was too much for me. i appreciate the creative ideas. wished there were more seafood and vegetables."
"had dinner with wife,son, daughter-in-law and three ki "
super location- had the surprise menu for 2- 4 courses- 3 meat 1 fi 
"i think after a mention in the michelin guide they are chasing a star. however they need to look at their tactics. the menu is small and very experimental which is fine. however a good restaurant would have a fall back of more standard dishes. even the soup of the day was a cold one. if there is nothing you like the look of then there is no where to go. i had the ceviche and the salad for starter the raw fish was like eating oysters (which i love) but without the fresh taste of the sea and citrus. the salad had everything thrown in and a selection of all the sauces they do of all colours, not particularly enjoyable. my son had the goose which was supposed to come with a different salad but it looked the same to us. it was not much better than mine. we fell back on the dry aged ribeye because of the limited choice. it was okay standard steak, cooked ok. the bearnaise did not taste home made. sitting outside was okay, but no table cloth and the large black plastic numbers stuck on the tables did not help the ambiance. for desert i had the creme brulee which was very nice, and my son the panna cotta which was fine. he had lived in leeuwarden for a year and always wanted to visit this restaurant. he brought me as a treat and was disappointed it did not work out as expected. the service was ok but being one of the few outside we felt we were sometimes an after thought. a very average evening there are better in the town."
"we had nice drinks in the afternoon and reserved for an early dinner in the evening. when we reported reservation was not there but we got the table near the waterside. ordered directly and had drinks, after 30 min. we asked where the food was, sorry the kitchen starts as from 17.30. we had our food at 18.00 and the service was  not very dedicate "
the male manager was so rude. telling us to leave as soon as we had finished our coffee and threatening us if we didn’t. not a relaxed coffee and over priced. do not go!!! 😠
"after being told they couldn’t cater for a group of 10, 4 of us sat down for coffee and cake. the waiter was extremely rude on several occasions giving us time limits we had to eat and order more food by. he said if we didn’t order more food and drink within 5 minutes he would kick us out (we were the only customers here and had been sat down not even 30 minutes). he spoke to use disgustingly and sarcastically and i wouldn’t come back here even if i was paid. he then proceeded to wave his hand and point aggressively into all our faces trying to move us out our seats of which he scared us so we had to leave. over priced arrogant managers - take your money elsewhere as it’s a lovely little town but this guy shouldn’t be in public service."
"we stopped at this restaurant for a coffee in the sun. after 30 minutes we were told we needed to order more food or we had to leave. the manager was so rude, intruded our personal space and waited until we left. do not visit this restaurant, it’s overpriced and the customer service is disgusting."
we went to this restaurant during a one day excursion to leeuward 
"this looked a very good bet - well located just to the side of the city centre on an attractive square and with an attractive interior, this was a disappointment. the service was very slow and inattentive...and one point 2 of the service team were sat at the bar whillst we were waiting to have our plates cleared and the whole dinner process became a chore, including even paying the bill which took just so long. the food itself was ok....not outstanding and certainly not good value (expensive for what we received) and the menu and drinks menu was surprisingly restricted. staff were very friendly, i must say, but just the whole system was slow, slow, slow."
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but don’t order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. “i’ll tell the chef” was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
"bad place, the menu is different from the one in the photo. a waitress spilled sauce on my girlfriend, dirtying her jacket, shirt and trousers. they never apologized or gave any discount, they didnt even ask if they could help. also the meat wasnt good, it tasted like supermarket meat. "
"we booked a table for 5 persons but it was not ready when we arrived. this was a bit disappointing. it is a big place and the staff walks around with headsets which makes it a bit plastic and not personal to my opinion. the steaks were delicious, no doubt. but not a place to go for a romantic quiet dinner, more casual with friends."
"at first glance, a pretty and decent institution. beautiful glass sails create a cozy place. but do not rush! appearance is deceiving and this is the case. the second time i visited this avidion, i was convinced that i would definitely never come back and spend my 1.2 or 100 euros. why??? because, disagreeable service. lack of service. sleepy staff roam the hall, who are too lazy to smile, say hello. by their general appearance and manner of communication, you might think that you came to but to their home and they, giving you a huge favor, gave you tea / coffee / dish. further, on my first visit, the lady waiter 40+ presented me with a bill of vegetarian salad and two beers at 25 euros. at first i paid her in cash, even left a tip for a couple of euros. but after that, i looked in the menu to find out the price of beer. and it turned out that my bill was 20 euros. after discussing this, she returned 5 euros. without saying even sorry. today, i decided to look again at this “farmer’s den” hoping to catch a different atmosphere there. and what do you think? at the arena, the same ladies. with the same bias, not a welcoming look and complete antipathy. the only plus for today, did not have to wait a long time for the dish, as the institution was empty. but the bill, i had to wait, because the waiter (the same lady 40+) had a nice chat with the man and without paying any attention to me, demonstrating clearly ignore. she did not pay attention that i had already left the table, went to the cash register and was ready to quickly pay the bill. i was in a hurry, as it was time to run on the train. disgusting staff! disgusting service! complete antipathy to the institution, even in other cities. i will not go to this place even in other cities, and i will never recommend this loetje cafe to my friends / acquaintances / relatives."
"nice location and inside set-up. average service. got a hamburger and a fish, both not enough cooked."
we chose to have a meal here because my partner wanted to try frisian food. however i dont think the menu is at all frisian. they brought us sausage coated in white chocolate when we arrived. i am vegetarian so my boyfriend ate both. they then brought some bread with tapenade and some olive oil jelly. i am sure frisians are not eating this at home. during this time we still waited for the menu. it seemed odd to wait so long. my boyfriend chose a fish dish and i chose the only veggie opti 
 we had to wait ages for our meals and the waiter was not friendly. the food was great though and the ambience is super. but the waiters attitude brought the whole experience down. a sha 
"tasty but. starter was a tomato soup with meatballs. it was ok. after the starters er had to wait a long time before the served the main. i had the walrus burger, tasty but it was red inside. i am normally a guy who order the beef medium rare, but you cant serve a burger that way. that is terrible. for dessert there was ice cream and fruit, it was a generous portion."
de walrus has a nice vibe. outside is a basic seating area and the inside is huge and cozy. food is fine.
the most unusual aspect of this cafe is the way they present copious dishes of rhubarb with every meal despite it often not complementing the dish chos 
"food is okay. staff is very bad, they keep you waiting while they are not doing anything. and seem very grumpy at the table. i had this experience multiple times. by far the worst staff in town."
"the walrus is the big name in leeuwarden for eating and drinking. it occupies two and a half historical building and has a large terrace in front of it. the lunch special was a rather sizeable and tasty meatball for a good price, not bad. they could strengthen the menu a bit in low-carbohydrates and vegetarian options. service is friendly, though a little distracted, and not very fast. it was an irritant that the staff were quite busy rearranging the terrace during lunchtime (12:30) on a sunny saturday. removing gas heaters to be able to draw in the huge parasols, storing stuff right behind our back whilst we were working on the meatball. this could be done more pro-actively earlier i think."
we decided to have dinner here as the menu board at the entrance showed some dishes that would be compatible with certain intolerances we ha 
the service runs entirely via an apple ipod. so chances are that the service becomes impersonal. which is the case and the server blames it on the system! 
the restaurant has a nice atmosphere but when it come to the food we were a bit disappointed. the service was very slow and when we finally received our meals they were just average and therefore a little bit overpriced in my opinion.
since entering the city we had multiple attempts of people trying to get us to have dinner at the walrus. one even offering us free drinks if we di 
"went for the second time a couple of months, with similar experience "
"we visited this place on hemelvaartsdag for dinner and it was very busy. we ordered drinks and they came swiftly. also the food was quick to arrive. the staff is wonderful and very helpful. we had a walrus burger (medium rare), pork fillet sate and 2 salmon steaks. the burger was not medium rare as promised on the menu and the salmon steaks were full of little bones. ok, it is a steak and not a fillet, but still. the sate consisted of large chunks of meat, heavily marinated, but not dry. the sate sauce and atjar were very good. fries were great, salad and fruit compote nice. overall a nice place to have an uncomplicated dinner, but the food can be improved."
"dont get me wrong. this place is solid, but from when i started going there three years ago it lost some of its charm. definitely doesnt deserve the #1 rating it has. again, i still go there but there are other places in town that offer better food (unless youre really into bar food). the beer selection though is great as are the staff and the atmosphere is unique. definitely go, just beware that its not really a #1 pick. "
"very central bar/restaurant. staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is good. menu was very varied, with specials available. the quality was fine and the prices very competitive.  recommended for a quick, basic lunch."
"last night we decided to dinner in leeuwarden. i picked the no.1 restaurant in leeuwarden to celebrate our 2 years relationship. service of the waiters is nice they are really pay attention to the guests. this restaurant really busy in the weekend. i ordered vlees trio but sadly the meat its too cold and the fries also. so i told the waiter and they gave me extra meat and fries, but frankly its almost the same they are not really hot when arrive in to my table. because shortly lots of people coming to dinning the service bit slow, we have to wait 10 minutes for our last coke col "
i was here on a monday night on my own for business. as it was the only restaurant with people on the market near my hotel i choose to have my dinner here. i took a glass of red wine and the tame duck for a main course. quality of the food was oke and the amount was more than reasonable. for the rest nothing special to report.
"nice place and food, super slow service. they have some burgers which, personally i did not find attractive (too greasy, simple, heavy...lets just throw some stuff). i waited for a beer half an hour, literally. and also when we asked for a receipt they were slow. excuse was: it is busy "
very busy restaurant. waiters are nice and friendly. food was not very good. steak was weldone and the other raw.
"i went here with a partner for our first date (long distance relationship) we ordered a platter and it was good but after we paid and left we noticed that the waitress who had been cranky all evening and hadnt even cracked a smile or welcome us had not given us the right change and we wer 13 euros short (hadnt noticed at time as she was rushing us and we never recieved a typical bill she just came up with a bum bag of change and told us the price , no reciept nothing so we gave her the money and worked it out afterwards that we had been short changed and 13 euros is quite alot to lose when theire platters of food is about that mu "
"this bar/restaurant is excellent for drinks, tea and cake (i highly recommend the monchou taart) or lunch but not so much for dinner.  i think the quality of the dishes is okay but not good enough to justify the (high) price."
"the location in the historic centre is great, but the food is bog standard stuff, the staff is efficient but are just that, no attention to their customers, other than the obligatory everything ok?"
the service is great: the waitresses were all very helpful and friendly; they were fast and efficie 
friendly staff and ok food. nice atmosphere. lacking a bit in taste of the food- too nice in a way. would liked the tastes a bit more experimental.

"used to come here 3 times a year, this time i came with my girlfriend for a nice diner. we could pick our own table since we were reasonably early. after we sat down the waitress seemed tired or something, anyway we ordered some drink at first and looked into the menu card which had broad options. after decided what to eat we needed to wait 4 minutes for the waitress to notice us. we ordered carpaccio as starter that had some grilled cheese on it (odd combination) which had an overwhelming taste. after that we went for the main course, we took the rib-eye steak and spareribs (kinda cheesy food i know) food was reasonably fast at our table. while eating the waitresses had no eye for us anymore and couldnt get their attention for something to drink so had to wait 10 minutes before we could finally draw their attention. starter couldve been better, main course was nice but the employees werent capable of managing 10 tables with 3 waitresses. i used to enjoy the hospitality of the owner and his big smile but he was working at the bar unfortunately. "
"the only reason to come here is that it is cosy. old fashioned with lots of candles at night. however, the food is not great and the service is much too slow. i would not return. there are better choices out there. there are steep stairs to the bathroom. on the stairwell there is an old fashioned marble sink and a faucet. in the bathroom there are blaring commercials for this restaurant(!?)."
i had the fish & chips which was not very expensive but certainly not a bargain either. for that price i would have expected cod but im pretty sure i got hake. staff is very friendly and there is a wide range of beers to choose from.
"the lunch menu contained beaf, chicken, pork, lamb etc  even after indicating i was vegan and explained what it meant i still got a salad with cheese....  restaurant is nice on the inside and has an old school feel to it."
its a nice place where eat something traditional. always was good and the price was not so expensive. good beers and kindness owner!
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description. 
this restaurant was chosen by an opinion gave by the recepcionist from the hot 
"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didn’t order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didn’t show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."

located near the railwaystation but quiet. has a nice terrace. not sure about the food quality. rather mixed opinions. good for a quiet drink on the terrace. the inner room is less cosy.
"this was one of the few places that didnt look too pretentious in the area. it was not too late in the afternoon but the place seemed very quiet. anyway, the waitress was very helpful and we had a good, basic, meal."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"as the title says. the sausage (rookworst) is awesome. the other food is good, nice and the shop is super-dutch. a must for foreign tourists"
the shop is not very special. quality of products is good but not exceptional. the interior of the store is a not very attractive
lower price range department store... no more and no less.
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
"well, what to say? i guess we all know what mcdonalds is, and if you dont, keep it that way. they serve what you call fast food. im not against fast food perse, but it should be nutritious, healthy and well cooked. it was not well cooked, im sorry to say. the burger i had was still on some spots raw and under cooked. toilets were dirty and the personnel were rude and impolite. when i asked for a moment to decide, the lady behind the counter walked away and served someone else. i really need only a second to read the menu. fast food and fast serving. oops. im really sorry, i hoped for a better experience, but unfortunately it was not. next time no mcdonalds."
"generally, i do not recommend american fast food while traveling abroad.  however, if you walk by, go in and get an order of fritz with fritz sauce."
"nice burger joint. trendy, rock and roll interior a bit reminiscent of a hard rock. decent, build your own burgers. nothing really surprising in that note. decent selection of beers to wash it all down. nice staff."
"went with a group of colleagues.  ordered the drinks fairly quickly, but it took 45 mins for menus to arrive! almost 1 hour 30 for food to show up.  when it did, it was your fairly good but also average café burger."
"absolutely delightful atmosphere, our group stayed for almost three hours. the food is good, just not mindblowing. its worth the prices though, so i didnt exactly feel let down or anything. we stayed inside as it is october, but double b has large, very comfy-looking yeard and terrace for summer. i like the way you build your burger yourself, as in choose the bun, patty, sauces and extras all by yourself, so you get what you want easily. just because of that id recommend this to families and large groups, there is something for everyo "
"had found double b on tripadvisor and thought the restaurant sounded promising. i was visiting the city of leeuwarden with my family for the weekend so we all went down there for some dinner. in my personal opinion, i thought that the decor was tacky with an overwhelming characteristic of a shrine to the usa accompanied by music that was played several notches too loud. it took a while to know where to go as once inside the building there are several directions one can choose to go in, and there is no direction of which way you should go for what. once we were finally seated at a table in the bar/restaurant area, the staff left us and ten minutes later we still had not been given any menus and had yet to have had a drinks order taken so, my patience having been worn somewhat thin, i flagged down a member of staff and asked if we could make a drinks order and get some menus. once we had the menus, which are really cool by the way, you write on it with a marker to personally customise your burger, choosing the bread, the meat, toppings, sauce etc. it took an extra 15 minutes and some serious hinting on my behalf for the staff to notice us yet again. my mother had some enquiries into what the veggie burger was made out of, which the server did not know but said he would find out and come back; which he never did, this was very disappointing as he was the friendliest server that they had sent our way so far. once we had finally been able to order, no one at any point came back to take anymore drinks orders that in the end meant i went to the bar to order our drinks, which was inevitably the quickest service we had seen all night. i guess what they say about if you want something done properly then do it yourself seems to have been particularly true at this place. the food was delicious once it had arrived, so kudos to the kitchen. the slow service prevailed however and we eventually had to go up to pay rather than ask anyone for the bill. whilst i do imagine, this is an anomaly rather than the norm, as the majority of reviews are very good; the night was extremely disappointing because of all the good reviews i had previously seen on tripadvisor, and had been therefore excited to eat there. needless to say that i was entirely disenchanted by the affair and will not be returning there in a hurry."
"again i am surprised about all the 5* reviews for this restaurant based on the quality of the food we ate. we arrived without a reservation on a friday night and found a table for two. the vegetarian dim sum is fried and not steamed, which was a surprise but tasted quite good. spring rolls were as you would find anywhere. for the sate main the vegetarian choice was just ok (sauces not that good), but the fish was barely cooked let alone barbequed (see photo with review). i could have done better myself in 15 minutes at home, possibly the trainee chef was on this night. as they seem to specialise in sate i found this top be a poor show. maybe this is a place for meat-eaters as wouldnt recommend for nayone to try."
"basic food, basic service. but not bad! for the price, you get fine quali "
we excitingly made a reservation for an anniversary dinner at 19.00 (email confirmation from restaurant). when we arrived we were received by closed and locked doors. we tried calling the restaurant but no one picked up. on their website it said that they were ope 
"on the plusside the cafe has a great location on the canal. but when we went there it took 45 minutes to get drinks and 2 hours to get something to eat. and they basically just serve sandwiches and other light meals. maybe they had a bad day, but i wouldnt choose this place if i didnt have alot of time to spend waiting..."
"because i hadn’t seen my friend for a while, we decided to go for a high tea and catch u "
"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
"as a snackbar it’s quite commercially operated and loses the touch with its customers , could do with a lot more personal attention"
"went there with wife while waiting for daughter. very nice drinks, superb upstairs which is probably better to sit in than downstairs. good for people watching."
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
"my wife and i had lunch here, i ordered saltbeef and liver, my wife homemade beef burger. i ask the waitress what sort of liver it was, she asked the chef and he said it was cows liver. to my amazement i received processed liver sausage with big white pieces of fat through out. my wife beef burger appeared to be home made, but was cooked in advance. from the time we ordered our meal to receiving it would not have been long enough to cooked such a big burger, it was just reheated, but not hot enough to melt the cheese topping. i eat my lunch after all it was liver, my wife returned her burger, she was offered an alternative butt by now she had lost her appetite."
away from the larger cities in the netherlands this restaurant in sneek is okay for a local experience. however compared to many other place around de tuut is average at bes

"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if we’d reserve a table for 6:30pm, we’d have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again. "
"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."
a group of sailor friends we went to the place last night. the food was just ok but the staff were so uninterested in helping us sort the menu out. we waited a long time to be served and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. when we left there was no good b

it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"this evening we (a family of 5) stopped by this hotel restaurant because we always enjoy the van der valk menu. however, after being seated we were ignored for 10 minutes. i then went to pick up some menus myself so that we could choose our meals. however, a further 10 minutes passed and we were still completely ignored. we tried to call over a waiter to place our orders but no-one responded. finally we just left and went to another restaurant. so i cannot give a review of the food at this place because we never got any.

"made a timely reservation for 20 people - birthday celebration - and received a phone call just the night before: we have to cancel; we made an error in your booking - try somewhere else - no sorry, no sympathy, no effort to reschedule - just basically get lost. never trust this place when you have an important event."
"there is place for 300 people i guess and it was almost full. the food is really nice, if they have it. they we out of chicken!!! 😳 the taste of the food was good but the portions were not all equal, some got a small piece some got a huge piece of meat, i would say the double. the tables are too big (for me it is more inportant that i can talk with the person in fron of me than the decoration of the table, that together with the noise make the place not as nice as it could be). but overall was good."
this is another van der valk restaurant with reasonable quality of food at a friendly price level. the splendid view over the adjacent lake is a bon 
"with me van der valk restaurants conjured up an image of a road side restaurant, where you could obtain a quick lunch or dinner for a reasonable price, with ample food of medium quality. added to the fact that i had not visited van der valk for more than ten years, i was surprised at the nicely appointed big restaurant inside the van der valk hotel in sneek. we dined there on friday evening and saturday evening. if i would only review the dinner experience of friday the review result would have been easily 4 points with something to spare. delicious food, friendly and dedicated service, a superb italian wine and a table in a quiet corner, who could ask for more. so, anticipating another splendid meal, we booked the same table for the saturday evening. however, the experience of this evening was less satisfactory. the entree was ok, but with the main course the problems started. never mind that the person who served us with the main course was very indifferent, almost rude and shoved the dishes on the table on any old spot without taking care that the we could reach the dishes without getting up from the table, but the big problem was the quality of the side dishes. the cauliflower was still frozen; the french fries and fried potatoes were obviously recycled. i really want to believe that food leftovers from the tables are not used again at van der valk but with this experience i start to wonder. we sent it all back to the kitchen of course but we marveled about the difference in quality between the friday and the saturday. also we wondered that those side dishes ever could have been approved in the kitchen. that is why my review is only three points and explains the mixed feelings. one really positive observation i want to share is that every table received fresh linen after it was cleared! this is the standard in italy of course but in dutch restaurants the table linen is virtually glued to the table and gets only a superficial brush down after the table is cleared. high marks for van der valk in this area. the price of the food is of course of the inflated dutch variety, but in moderation. dutch restaurants have the highest prices in europe, but here at van der valk the prices are moderate for dutch standards. conclusion: mixed feelings and hit or miss."
"a week ago, after an excellent dinner and friendly service, we made a reservation for a table for the consecutive sunday. unfortunately we made the opposite experience on our second visit: no table available outside at the time agreed, unfriendly and arrogant behaviour by the « cheffe » (style: couldn’t care les "
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an ‘i told you we were busy’. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"friendly service but poor food.started with popcorn with paprika and a kind of kerry dipsauce which is a strange choice for an appetizer;i had the gnocchi which were tasteful but the main course(fresh fish) was very disappointing,sauce was too thick,fish not really fresh...the white wine proposed by the waiter was a viognier montmarin and was very good.i hope it was just a bad day for the cook because the service was friendly but the food bad and clumsy presentation."
just a normal restaurant with decent food but nothing out of the ordinary. kind staff and the size of the portions are more than sufficient.
"if youre looking for nice solid food, you wont be disappointed here. things like schnitzel, burgers and steak are on the menu."
"i put average on my review because of the decor and the friendliness of the staff; however, the culinary experience was not for us a big succe "
"this coffee shop is across the plaza from the centrall station and opens early. if you need to catch an early train, or arrive in apeldoorn early, you can find good coffee and breakfast treats at a very reasonable price. the atmosphere is friendly and the food is fresh! its only a few blocks away from the central shopping area."
the sub is more or less what you can expect from subway but service is poor and slow. the coffee was in a tiny cup and just drinkable so best to stick to sodas.
worst customer service we ever experienced in a mcdonalds. 3-4 employees looking at you waiting to place an order at the mccafe. after several minutes of waiting i decided to place an order at the machine. it took 5 minutes until somebody appeared at the coffee machine despite no other tasks at this point of time for the employees. coffee cooking took another 10 minutes. after completion the two cups were placed on a cupboard to be picked up by another employee. additional 2-3 minutes waiting time while most employees were just doing nothing. of course the two cups had no marking indicating what the cappuccino and what the latte machiatto is. overall highly disappointing and badly organized. the management needs to start working on a lot of issues in this restaurant.
"had a mckroket; those are interesting. a pretty standard mcdonalds with free wifi and decent service, but they have the machines at the front so you dont have to interact with anyone if you dont want to, you asocial silly person. :)"
"tastefull chips as long as one still is able to eat. belgian style, i think, it was nice for as long as it lasted, but with the times, i have developped a sensitive stomach, but that is with eating in general. i think i definitely suffered hostile medical support, somewhere else. its kind of sad not to be able to really endure any food anymore. "
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had saté. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "

the restaurant looks very nice (i was staying in the hotel) and the staff is dressed very smart. had the signature dish the short ribs. presented very nice but for my taste there was to much fat and to little real meat. the freshnstrawberry and ice cream dessert was good! prices are reasonable.
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.

"what a waste. no way she was going to serve me a cup of tea “no way sir, not my job” and serving me a kroket that was rotten: “yes sorry, i already thought it was off’. if i was the owner i would be ashamed. but apparently they completely lost it, don’t care anymore and you as a customer should not care either. don’t go. there is tons of places in the area that love to serve with a smile and deserve your money more then ever."

"it was a first time for us that we were going to a van der valk restaurant; it is a very big restaurant, service is friendly and quick...the food is less that average (i ate better in some dutch snack-bars..), but what shocked us was the moment when the waiter brought our bottle of bordeaux to our table already opened...apparently the restaurant manager had ordered to have the bottles of wine already opened this because not all young serving staff did get a proper horeca training. that was a first even in the netherlands (after 33 years leaving here.. :-) ) "

"we arrived at the restaurant and had no reservation. it tok about five minutes before someone from the staff noticed us. we asked foir a table for two and that was no problem, even we had no reservation. it took a while (again) before they gave us the menu. we orderd something to drink and that took nearly ten minutes before we get something. after that everything seems to go smoother, but the gap between the apatizer and the main menu was hughe. thats why we doubt to order a dessert. we desided to order it and now there was a normal gap between the main menu and the dessert. we desided not to go there again and for sure not with guests"

"nice atmosphere, friendly staff. didnt listen very well to our order. we asked the childrens steak to be prepared well done but received it very raw. side dish to my salad never arrived. not much attention from staff once our food was served. food itself was oke, not spectacular but reasonable quality for the price we paid."
"whether it is because of the low ceilings, but dinner in this restaurant was not really a pleasant affair.  the food is good but the atmosphere in and the ambiance of the restaurant did not do it for us on this occasion."

"i had lunch here with a former co-worker. when we arrived and found a table, we ordered our drinks and asked for the menu. after getting the drinks, we still had no menu, so after another 5 minutes we tackled another waitress to ask again for a menu. when we ordered our food the appliance the waitress used already had problems. food came quickly and was fine. as the waitress removed our plates we immediately asked for the bill as my friend needed to get back to the office and had only 15 minutes left untill her meeting. we waited for at least 10 minutes and still had no bill, so we decided to get up and find a check-out option. the waitress asked if we had already gotten a receipt: no we didnt, we asked for one 10 mins ago and nothing... she would check it out. she came back and said that our order could not be found in the computer, so another employee came, wrote down our order and had to input it in the computer again. by that time my friend was already too late for her meeting. after about 15 mins we finally got our bill and could pay. what irritated me most what that we got no apology whatsoever. no discount, no coupon for next time.. nothing."
had a good lunch with a business relation. nice waiter who almost works there for 25 years. we ate some eggs and had some coffee. everything fine. tables are close to each other in certain areas of the restaurant so would not go there for a romantic dinner.
"we were there in february for a business / relach dinner ... nice place, cosy place, fresh food, nice drinks ... but can only be considered as exceptionnal, fabulous, fantastic,  "
"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "

"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"the food is excellent, but.. what a pity that the restaurant is on a top day fully booked.. and the tables are cramped.. the people you see are people who you find normally in snackbars.. and are not really appreciating good food...the price of the wines is 3times what you pay in the stores.. and that is what i find a rip of.. but there is plenty of staff and they really do their best.. so what is wrong with us?? we think the chef deserves a better clientele... and guest who are willing to pay more and have some more space.."
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"i believe several times i consumed a drink, a smoothy, or a coffee, or a hot chocolate, for it looks hip, that restaurant, or has organical products, american quality, but i dont get the things done, that need to be done, its all waste of time. and it costs money, all those things do, and i dont make any friends, anemies, yes. "
"it is a pity that the brick and mortar shops nearby are empty, for rent. the street with the outside tables is not lively. service is fine. food is good."
nice coffee and a relaxed entourage. we did only some drinks but the menu looks great and tasty. one small comment: there was no baby changing place.
"this place is nothing special: just a corner restaurant where you can get bagels (different varieties with different toppings), juices, coffees. bagels are good though, served warm. several kinds of cream cheeses to choose from too. all in all nice place for lunch if you dont want anything fancy."
arriving at 18.00 with a group of

"this mac is not very big allot of trash outside but this can be a moment moment. the food is normal like any other mac so enjoy. your close to the highway so you can go east, west, north and south."
"nice place, not a huge selection on the menu but enough for a nice lunch. went there with my mother and they were willing to change her selection so she could eat it more easily as shes handicapped."
"nice pub, visit it often for drinks and sometimes to have a nice me "
told us to leave because we were having a good time cat was on the bar got upset when we stroked it dont go here owner is miserable

"we booked a “wild” menu (5 coarses) to celebrate the season, knowing a lot of game is available on the veluwe. the result was a bit disappointing however as if the cook still was in summertime spirits. also the wine combinations were pretty average, and for one dish even horrible (wine far too sweet for the rather sour (mustard) tasting dish). all ended up in a too high price/quality ratio. we have had better experiences for even lower prices."
discapoining food in a great environme 
we were a party of 7. special occasion family dinner and selected this restaurant for its reputatio 
"fantastic meal at this establishment, but the hotel room was rather disappointing - not enough attention to detail and too dark.  lights broken, decor a bit tatty.  i would eat here again, but not stay."
"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"
"driving along the road into town a big sign in front of the restaurant xl steak €17.95. sounds fine. checked on the menu at the entrance: again xl steak €17.95. we ordered 2 of those. nice big steaks, modest portion french fries, tiny portion sauce. no garlic butter as promised on the menu. as desert caramel coupe, described as vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and pieces of chopped caramel. the ice cream was very soft and the caramel sauce missi "
"very average food, in an average hotel. staff friendly, but poor quality food for a four star hotel. dinner and breakfast both over-priced for quantity and quality. go just up the road to restaurant de heerlijckheyt het loo, and youll get a much better meal."
"the two other top rated restaurants in apeldoorn were fully booked so we fell back on the navet, rated #3. while the food was generally good, each dish of the 3-course menu was over-complicated. no wonder it took ages for the cooks to prepare them. also, the alsatian pinot gris flavour was off as it had obviously been kept for too long (375ml bottles do not keep well). the last straw was when we were charged a supplement of 17 eur for two small pieces of veal sweetbread which had been offered without information about the cost. its a shame how these small details can ruin an otherwise positive experience."
"it was a take-away hot chocolate, i didnt consume on the terrace, which looked nice enough, because i also feel the need to smoke a sigarette, when i consume such a drink, but i think the wheather was to bad, to much wind, so i consumed it somewhere else."
nice please to hang a round to haven an easy meal with a couple of drink.the haven open towards 6 o’clock in the event (18:00)
we sat down for a quick lunch at this place. the tomato soup took for ever to arrive.   i had one beer and was never asked if i would like another. waving didn’t help either!
"very slow & we had a very unprofessional waiter. even with a half empty restaurant. thankfully, food was tasty when it arrived. will not be going back"
"location very nice got outside table, with perfect view of square.  omelet cold and greasy. not able to cafe latte eith lowfat milk. service friendly - but had to wait for service - even very few guests."
"we went here late one afternoon and quickly found a seat. we had planned on just having a drink but as we stayed longer decided to be lazy and have food as well. we had the house red wine to drink, which was nice and at €11 per small carafe good value. for food we had vlammetjes to share, i settled on the satay java and my mum on the vissersverdriet. my satay was bone-dry, there was one piece of kroepoek (prawn cracker) and the rest of the plate was just filled with chunky chips. my moms vissersverdriet was smoked salmon on toast, nothing more then that. she even stated that the cucumber seemed to be missing. not worth the price. well stick to drinks the next time we visit. although the vlammetjes were lovely."
"we were in apeldoorn for an antique market, and it was time to eat something. we had a choice of restaurants to go to, and we chose this one because its menu included uitsmijters...a favorite of mi "
"stopped here on a sunny weekday afternoon to have a drink on the terrace in the summer sun. the ambiance was really nice on the square next to the old town hall, with its carillon bells going of regularly. the service was prompt, friendly and appropriate with a good attitude towards me, my wife and my toddl "
"so we cycled to apeldoorn and sat a grand café, at the moment we came in some people where just about to leave their table at the window. perfect we thought so we can keep an eye on our bikes. their cups and glasses where still on the table but we did not bother, because we expected they would be taken away immediately by the waiter. after a few minutes (5 or so) a waiter comes and we order two cappuccino and both a piece of apple cake. after 7 minutes or so we finally get our cappuccinos in glasses which where not washed very well. (meanwhile the other glasses are still on the table) the waiter goes away, and we assume he is going to get the apple cake. but no, he starts hanging out with the other waiters. after 5 minutes we finally get our apple cake. that took long, but they had most likely put it in the oven to warm up a bit. noooo the ice crystals almost on there that cold it was. we where lucky an other waiter spotted the other glasses and finally took them away. for >10 euros we expect a bit more, it does not have to be perfect but a clean cup would have been nice. and in winter you do not serve cold apple pie."
"needed to go into apeldoorn center to buy some gifts.   was a bit hungry and tried de notaris.   simple dishes, but okay.   maybe more suitable for a drink."
"service was poor, too few staff for a busy evening. food wasnt bad, but have waited for it a bit too long. as you get your printed bill after you pay i didnt notice they put one extra drink i didnt have on it. not good, will not go there again, definitely not recommended."
"after reading the reviews we visited this restaurant in apeldoon, was very disappointing experience, the owner who runs this restaurant has the word guest hospitality not in his vocabilary very rude. the service from the waiters was ok & the food reasonable but surely not worth the price they charge. i had crème brûlée for desert, that desert i really dont know how they dare to offer that. it doent come any where 1% close to what crème brûlée  "
"came with a group, our company fills at least two tables here each evening. put us on a table that was way too small. did not want to solve this, needed some heavy persuasion to get an extra chair that was given with a manner than can only be described as contempt. foodwise, i had the seasonal menu, first course was average and common, main course was a good piece of meat but with far more salt than needed for this quality, dessert again was not special. "
"the quality of the food is good: i had the deep fried mushrooms with herb-cream sauce as a starter and it was a good as i remembered. main dish grilled salmon with risotto. nice piece of salmon, grilled to perfection: very moist and tender. the portions are not huge and i think the prices are a bit high. for 2 people having both just 2 courses (of which for 1 person it was even a summer special menu for 24 euro), some bread to start and a total of 3 glasses of wine and 1 coffee, i think 75 euro is a bit over the top. therefore, the rating average."
we visit this restaurant on a sunday in december.  the restaurant was very nice decorated in x-mas style.. is was fully booked.  good  food and  great service.  the time betweem the different courses of the menu was too long.as a result of the many guests.
this is a restaurant since 1993 in an old buildi 
"the offered food is indeed very good, not cheap. the offered menu;s are too small and far to expensive for those little portions. staff is friendly and the service is ok."
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
"lovely terrace, descent food, chaotic service. i.e. go for lunch or a drink when the weathers fine - but expect slow service."
"nice place in the center of town. former school of music. on sunny days one of the favorits with locals, because of the big terrace with loung style seats. good spot, but for a beer or so, not for food; menu consists mosly of overpriced snacks and bites. staff sometimes seems more interested in eachother than in their guests"
"had lunch here, lured in by the nice outside sitting area and the advertising that they won a price in the past for a best lunch in the provin "
"to start, the waitress spilt an entire glass of beer into our friends handbag, offered an apology, these things happe "
before a movie i took my family to this place for lunch. the little man had a burger. he asked for a well done burger and the waitress said it might be a bit dry. so he agreed to a little bit of pink insid 
"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."
"simple good food, no more no less,  sufficient choice and good to get you going for a long walk and/or ride by bike"
we waited one hour to place our order. then we simply gave up and decided to stick around in the sun (still no one helping us). we talked to four different people in the staff who kept saying “someone will come in a minute” or “please wait a few minutes”. some staff completely ignored us when we asked for help. terrible. unfortunately not many options considering this is a national park.
we have been passing by to have a beer after our bike ride and even after 40 minutes we did not get a waiter to take an order. we went inside and they told us to wait outside at the table and also contacted 4 staff outside. nothing. very bad service.
"from the outside the place looks ok, but when you enter it doesnt feel like a restaurant at all. more like a cafeteria in a retirement home. very old and ugly and not a good atmosphere. the price of the food and drinks is too high for the quality. such a shame because its a great locatio "
"let me first say that the food we ordered was amazing. this was a 10/10. the amount of food and the presentation were beyond our expectations. but as we were sitting next to the bar/kitchen, we were able to see our food being prepared and hear the employees talki "
"although the food is of good quality, the portions are very small, taking the high price into account.  furthermore, its clear that because of cutting costs, hardly any side dishes are being served. conclusion, good food, but very expensive.l and small portions."
the food is mediocre but expensive. the waitress was very rude to us and the other waite 
"perhaps we came at the wrong time; late for lunch and a tad too early for dinner! the place was crowded, but we were offered a table for two. the breakfast/lunch menu was on offer, but apart from salads, there was limited gluten free choice. i ended up with the dutch pea soup, which was very good, except for the fact that on a separate place they still offered me bread! half way through eating our meal, the menus were changed for the evening, so although i did not look at this menu, perhaps we should just have had a drink first and then waited before ordering a meal! nice place to sit and watch the world go by!"
"i was looking forward to trying out the food in this place for quite some time. i went with a group of friends just before the dinner service started with the idea to have a drink first and order food a bit later. we wanted to sit outside, but the available tables had no chairs (people from neighboring tables took them away), so we sat inside. no one came to show us to seats or to greet us (the staff was going around us, as if we were in their way). we sat on the table and waited for about 20 minutes before someone came to take an order. we had our drinks and waited for someone to come to collect food order, but no one did. we paid and lef "
"very nice atmosphere, great service. however, portion sizes are way too small. the dishes are definitely interesting but nothing crazy. by the 5th course i’m still not full. going to have to stop by mcdonalds on the way home to eat something substantial."
"this meal was a joke. we paid eur 90 per person for a 5 course meal (i use this term loosely) with wine pairing. normally i would not find this amout unreasonable, however if you totalled the weight of the 5 courses we were served, it came out to perhaps 150grams of food per person. i realize that nouvelle cuisine is often served in small portions but this was an insult. unfortuanley the wine portions were equally small. this was a tasting, not a meal! luckily they served free bread. the tastings were interesting and if you feel compelled to go to this restaurant, make sure you eat before you go."
"it was a great evening with colleagues. we ate at “het zusje”. the food was nice, some food was “really good” and other were “not my type”. you order 2 small dishes at the time, when you’re done you can order 2 new dishes. you can take all evening till 22:30 to order. the staff was friendly but they seem to forget us all the time. it was busy but not too bu "
i think all the ingredients i remember can or do grow nea 
this was part of a business outing. there was not a lot to do. plenty of lanes to use. we had three. the games are short. not really needed to play for a full hour if the number of people is limited. food choices are limited and basic but well prepared. seating is limited as well
"weve been going here for years (with different quality over time) but this was probably the last visit ever as the food was incredibly bad. imagine beef chewy like old gum and poured over with a can of soy and fish sauce which made it uneatable , rice which been sitting there for a day or so and calamari with such a dodgy smell that we had to sent it back straight away. the dishes can be very tasty if there are chefs doing a good job, in this case clearly not! "
"we went with a group from work. the food was good but the amount was way to small. 1 saté had to be shared by 2 people, only a few fries per person, etc. etc. overall way to little. we were promised 5 courses and only got 4. inside the restaurant it was way to hot. when we wanted to order tap-water we had to order it with a drink. which we did but still didnt get in the end. when we asked for water they send us bottled water, which we returned but still ended up on the tab. in the end they wanted to make it up to us by giving a free round of coffee which also turned up on the tab. overall a bad experience."
"visited this place on 8th may. arrived at8pm, but was told that the kitchen was closing at8.30 and that we should hurry to order. no english menu available, but waitress was happy to translate for us. its a tapas kind of place, you order plates and they come not necessarily in order youd like them to. nachos- very large portion, empanadas with goats cheese- i didnt like these as i didnt understand that they contain goat cheese, but my husband loved them. pizza- it came with egg mayo salad in the middle of it- rather bizarre! my mixed salad was standard, under dressed. over all- not impressed at all with the food, not to my liking. "
"ate hear whilst staying locally in this arty part of arnhem. goed looks inviting and is nicely set out with an open pizza kitchen and some historic touches. it was busy at 6.30pm and, as others have commented, the service was a little disorganised. we had 5 different people help us and were asked for our order twice. that said the pizza and patatas bravas were good. the sharing plate concept would work with a big party but a little lost on two people with small appetites. equally not sure having asian followed by pizza and then buffalo wings is really a good thing, other than after a lot of beer. nevertheless, we were happy with what we had, and the reasonable price. i would recommend a try, as you might find the quirky style more appealing."
"i love going here for dinner so i decided to take my friend here for lunch. presentation looked nice. but i didnt care for it too much. my friend had a philley cheese steak sandwich and i had the crazy dog. hers didnt have enough meat on it and my bread was a bit cold on one side and the saugages were a bit overdone but flavors were nice. nachos were ok. service took a while refilling our drinks. such a shame. again, i do love going here at night. great vibes, good service, etc. but the lunch was a bit of a let down."
"the space is very nice and the menu is interesting. the quality of the dishes varies. the spare ribs for instance were very nice whilst the cheese fondue tapa (10 euros) was very weak with leukewarm instant fondue mix and limp vegetables. i asked to reheat the fondue and could see from my table the waiters reheating it and forgeting it again on the counter, so it arrived at the table cold again. this was indicative of the service of the restaurant. the waiters were nice and welcoming, but a bit careless, easily distracted and talking to each other and forgetting to pick up dishes and orders. the other weak point was the quality of the drinks. i asked for a glass of their house wine, and was surprised they were charging over 4 euros for a small glass of wine of very poor quality. there are many inexpensive good wines available in the dutch market so this should not be difficult to change. overall it was pleasant and one feels the place has potential, but needs to spruce up the service an quality control."
"average food, staff drilled in the kim yung style. the handbook says you drink from the bottle, so your request for a glass is denie "
"it is a great formula, sharing food on the table. the wine is good and so is the atmosphere. but the food is to be honoust average, tends to be fat and lacks originality. friendly service"
sorry ...only one visite is needed here. if you tried it once youll know next time better try one of the other restaurants in town
"interesting concept, you can eat all types of cuisine there. the location is a bit down as theyre the only restaurant in the area, but worth visiting. the lunch menu is a little empty if you want to have a big lunch. service was friendly."
"food: can be nice, can be a complete disaster. service: is always slow or not there at all. not enough expertise over all. lots of mistakes and long waiting."
"good food, nice service and a great place to sit outside on the terrace. food taste good and is fresh made, price however is a bit high"
"took ages to get menus and food. no wine list-beware they have a choice of 2 red ,2 white or ro "
"the ambience in very nice. the wines delicious, but the food and the service very poor. the service is very slow, i guess because they dont have enough waitresses. the food is standard, nothing special."
we went here on the recommendation of our conscierge. the food was tasty butte portions mean for the money.  the service was slacker than id have expected given the feel the restaurant had. i hate to have to continually ask for refills and water.
"we visited this restaurant for dinner on a thursday night, and we were glad that we had previously booked online as it was completely full. the tables are very close togeth "
"nice location on the gorgeous jansplein in arnhem. sadly, the food wasnt up to par. the risotto was very salty, tasteless, and cooked to a mush. disappointed."
"meal was not bad, but really not special, i dont understand that it can be number one in tripadvisor. atmosphere was good price also okay they have 0,5 liter beer, so thats good."
"menu has a lot of options but the food wasnt worth the money you pay for it. also took them almost 1hr and 15 minutes to serve the main dish, specially the duck breast was waste of good duck, theres no armony in the flavors and the duck was dry and the bacon cold. biefstuk was ok but then again nothing special."
"very close to the central train/bus station of the city arnhem. its small, only a few tables, which makes it intimate. service is very good and friendly. excellent draft beers also, it helps!;) the food i ordered was average of taste, but my friends was very good. so it depends i guess... the bathrooms are downstairs and when you enter, you are instantly back into the 60s... wow.. it could use an upgrade. the atmosphere is excellent, it is warm, cosy and gezellig "
"we had a good dinner, appetizer of salmon was lovely flavorsome and well presented. main courses where average to good. schnitzel over baked a bit, angus beef (grilled part) could have been more medium. service was friendly. as the title suggests food is good enough but not living up to the statements of excellence (not something to blame the restaurant for). good food at a reasonable price, nothing wrong with that! but reviewers seeming to make this a culinary experience do injustice to visitors expectation and thus this restaurant. for a pleasant decent meal which is value for money this restaurant is a good thing."
"cheap, terrible place with terrible service and ambience... you ask for some bread together with your wine and they tell you that you can go to the fast food if you need bread. just two people work in this restaurant and if it is full they are unable to manage it and look desperate and become rude... i guess the only reason it is not bankrupted yet, it is in front of railway station"
we had a main course and dessert. its a cosy place where they serve a good quality for the price. however if you want to dine in luxury and have really tasty food i wouldnt suggest going here.
good enough for a good quick meal if you happen to be around in arnhem. the evening sun in summer caresses your body whilst eating. in a good way ;)  it is certainly above average. the chose for a high standard of standard food.
"ordered a cheese & ham omelette but given two eggs on cheese, tomato and onion. could not eat it as have ibs. we pointed out mistake to server but still charged for the course. complained but told we have to pay. sorry but will not return."
"terrible, rude, racist. as a group of mature, retired tourists we went to this cafe that looked very nice but we were ignored, our order wasn’t taken, other customers served ahead of us to the point we knew it was deliberate, perhaps because we were british. so disappointed when everywhere else in holland people have been friendly and we have received first class treatment."
"this is a very populair bar/restaurant in arnhem. price/quality is okay. its cosy, has nice staff who provide good service and the food tastes ‘jammie "
"ok place, food is ok and staff,  if you want a quick bite but portions are a bit on the small side and there are other places that are better"
"not busy, sticky table and had to divert to city hall for a clean toilet. when leaving the question if we had paid which i did 2 minutes before. so once but not again.."
i liked the architecture of this building. nice early 20th century insurance office turned into a bar and restaurant. i had a nice beer here with my friends. nothing special though.
"ok, nice atmosphere, open kitchen and good terrace outside. food is good. service always nice and friendly."
"service very slow, after 30 mins we had to attract the waiter to be able to order. freah mint teafor over 3 euro and glass was not even full of water. salads took another long time so an hour after arrival we atr. grilled asparagus on salad were stone cold aswas the pulled chicked on the other salad. in fact it wasnt pulled but pieces of the cheapest cut of the chicken, so cold that you couldnt taste the flavour and too cold to pull it yourself. over 15 euro each, so totally overpriced. when we mentioned this to the waiter he said oh, well we always serve it like this. such a shame coz we will never come back and wewill most certainly not tell others to go there..."
theres better coffee around but its good for meeting/dating/working cakes are really good and homemade.
"dudok is well known in arnhem as a meeting place, because it is easy to find and conveniently located next to the largest church in the city centre. drinks and especially the food is mediocre and prices are not very cheap. most of the times it is very loud inside which does not make it ideal for business meetings. "
centrally located next to test main square it it however average food quality. staff friendly and the building is spacious so youre not cramped up to others
"much too busy and asking too much for the drinks. terrible coffee, noisy , but it is the closest to the friday and saturday market ."
"dudok is located in a monument in the city center. good place for coffee in the shadow of the monumental eusebius church. pleasant terrace in summer but sometimes a bit windy, inside quite noisy. go here if you are not in a hurry as it might take a while to get your drinks and food. overall quite ok. "
"this place is located close to the church, has an open area, is normally very full, but does not have anything special. is a good normal cafe"
if you prefer an overpriced lunch or dinner this is the place for you! ive been here on both occasion and i can say without a doubt that the food is literally thrown on the plate without any compassion or love for the products what so ever. during lunch paying a high price for some leafs of lettuce and a few strips of chicken with some tasteless sauce sitting in a noisy rubbish ambience lacking large hall with careless staff did not tick my button 
"not very cheap, but good food and drinks. in the summer the courtyard graden is very nice and the terras at the front gets allot of sun."
"it had the same interior like dudok in rotterdam. it is a good place for a lunch. we we visiting on a saturday and were lucky to find a table around 13.30 hrs. the food and service is quite good. if you want to have a more private conversations, this might not be the right place."
"dudok is a chain/franchise & ive visited the cafés in the hague & rotterdam as well. the interior design had a 1930s feel to it, and the menu has good dutch café classics. we had drinks and bitterballen and it was fine, although the service was a little slow.as with all dudok cafés, the acoustics arent great so its always quite noisy when full."
i went their for dinner two nights this week. i had the pork neck on the first night and it was quite a hearty dinner although not lavi 
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."
"if you do not like the combination of rare french fries with mayonaisee, do not go to this restaurant. again, we have the reunie and we spent tea time, lunch and dinner at tr "
"we were five: two adults, one child and two babies. the service at the beginning was pretty good, the waiter explained everything but the main course came after 30 minutes. the waiting was too much since we ordered steak, fish, two chicken nuggets and the restaurant was empty. only  "
we took time to relax in the shadow of st eusebius church with a few drinks from arnhems meisje. service was swift and the restaurant is in a good location not far from the hub of the old town. a standard but pleasant experience.
good place to have a drink in the sun. good food that is an ok price. good place to meet someone for lunch.
there are many more restaurants serving poor quality food for regular prices. but here they add abominable service and disrespect for free. what a bummer!
"well what can i tell you about my experience at this cafe bar. firstly i placed two hours parking on the meter a short (spitting distance) from the cafe, at the cost of approximately £5. (not their fault i grant you) we were sat to a table by a friendly waitress, who then walked off as though sitting to the table was all we had come to do. five minutes past and another friendly waitress attended our table and handed us menus and took our drinks order. two lattes please. these duly arrived at our table within an acceptable time, and we had time to browse through the menu. which really was like putting computer binary in front of me, as the whole thing was written in dutch. no translation. i did think im in holland why would they have the menu in english and fair enough i agree, but then a vast majority of the patrons sat around us were also english, all with furrowed brow trying to look like they understood what was written on the menus in hand. (its a point, is al "
"the restaurant has a large terrace which is great during warm days. the card is rather limited which is a pity, just a bit more choice would have made it more pleasurable. very friendly personnel which is a big plus!"
"of all the places ive eaten so far in arnhem, this was one of the most unimaginative places....  too bad.. my grandmother opened this spot............. all 8 of us were looking at each other and shaking our head...."
"as a local i got here with a friend of mine for a beer after we had dinner somewhere else. this is has been an item for years in the city of arnhem, but i wonder for how much longe "
"i have been here with a friend for an informal dinner. it was goed, nothing extraordinary but for sure above the average of a dutch eet-cafè. the veggie burger was awesome! price/ quality was also ok. if you are in arnhem, dont forget to stop here."
"we started off with a mix of small dishes (gozo, sashimi, yakatori) and then i had the fish of the days (sea bass) and my wife had tuna. both fish dishes were ok, but were accompanied only by a small salad garnish and some fried potatoes. so it was a bit boring. but from my experience at eating in arnhem to date, none of the restaurants seem to have imaginative menus."
found this place on tripadvisor and gave it a try as we were in the area. i was totally disappointed. came into the restaurant and the waitress asked what we wanted. a table obviously? service was slow and the food wasnt good. very tiny restaurant/cafe. i dont know why this restaurant is in the top 3 restaurants in arnhem. decided not to go for the main course here and asked for the bill. the staff were eating and didnt want to get up to give us the bill. had to go up to their table to ask. ridiculous. never again. 
the restaurant looks nice but we were lucky not to get a table in the basement. be sure if you book a table. the waiters are more busy talking to their kitchen colleagues than paying attention to the guests. when arriving at 17:15 (we did not book a table)there was a slight panic like they were expecting 100 people. at the time we left 2 hours later the place was not full yet. the food took very long. starter and main course in almost 2 hours.... dishes are average. we had to ask twice for the chefs dishes mentioned on the menu.
"having read the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, we were expecting great things from graave – we were disappoint "
having read good reports about this place we were very dissapoint 
"very nice meal, but terribly slow. 90 minutes to be served an appetizer and hamburger. waiter charming and most helpful in choices."
my wife and i ate here while we were visiting arnhem over the weekend for our trip to national park de hoge veluwe. id specifically picked this restaurant for its rating on tripadviso 
liekd the atmosphere and style. disliekd that i wasnt served within reasonable time. actually just drank and left although i wanted to have dinner.
"urban style restaurant, simple decoration but with good modern atmosphere with yo "
"with friends to sugarhill for a dinner. waiting time (no reservation possible) was around 2hours. we stayed, drinking some beer, as we would like to try this restaurant. when seated we had to wait again too long on the menu card and in the end the food. the food itself was good, but not great. some pieces of the beef were chewy. it is a cosy restaurant. in the end not worthwhile the waiting hours. "
"a remarkable place to hang out and have a nice wine of belgian beer. a very talented chef and very good food. but… i dont like eating there. the dont take reservations, so you just have to wait until a table becomes available. this stresses me out, also because others try to beat you to your turn. the personnel isnt very helpful. upto this point i left 3 times because of this."
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"on monday the 3rd of august my wife and i decided to have dinner at momento. it looked nice and it wasnt very busy, so we expected a quick service. how wrong were we! okay, they were quick with the drinks, but after ordering the food it all went down hill. we ordered a pea soup and beefburger for me and a vegan burger for my wi "
do not trust open hours information. came at 21:00 and they decide to close the kitchen sooner. neither the attendant could explain why. not trustworthy
"we called in to momento for a snack. the restaurant is large, new and very modern. the food was ok and the prices were very reasonable. however, there is no character or atmosphere in the restaurant – it reminded me of eating in a motorway service station café!"
"decent place, ideal when you decide last minute to have dinner with a larger group of friends. large restaurant, but always animate "
we found this place open for dinner within 5 blocks of the city center on a busy evening and it turned out to be more of a tapas style restaurant where you can order a few items to share except it had a limited menu with very entre ite 
"having ordered oyster rockafella to start then pork and salad, i waited 1 hour to have the salad arriv "
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"almost at the center of the beautiful presikhaaf park you find this small restaurant. you can have lunch here outside in the sun or inside if thats what you prefer. the prices are low because some off the staff have an working disability, this sometimes can cause funny situations so know where your going! i find it a very nice place, hope you enjoy it to as well as the park and the small farm for children."
"we arrived to caspar to catch some nice dinner after calling to ask if we could reserve. they said they do not take any reservations but seating two people should not be a problem. we arrived and asked if there was a table, and the waiter instructed us there was a long line. when we asked for an estimate of waiting time he replied: “can’t tell you. it’s a beer cafe so people stay to eat”. i asked if there was any way to estimate the waiting time and the waiter said “can’t tell you”. he proceeded to burp in my face and left."
"we had dinner here once but never again. quality of the food is poor and when we complained about one of the dishes, the servant said: are you a chef or something? no solition offered whatsoever. obviously the dont care about their customers. if you want a great evening go next doors. "
"it was good. the food choice is not extremely various but is very different from any other standard dutch bistrot. mostly vegetarian and unusual dishes (which i liked), the service was just a little slow and some improvement here would be appreciated."
"very good and friendly service, good location. restaurant offers a nice atmosphere, however the burgers are not that goo "
there is no options for people with allergies in their main menus and so we werent able to eat the burger. staff didnt seem faced with it either.  beware of that before you plan your visit
"the place is nice, good ambience but i didnt like the burgers that much. meat was too cooked and expensive for nothing especial."
"range of burgers, certainly no high cuisine. for a burger place not cheap, but much better then burgerking and mcdonalds."
"i have visited iveau burgers and wijn and ordered a gamba burger, which is the most expensive one, because i love prawns and i wanted to have a very nice lunch for my birthday, the price is €16,75 that made sure it was going to be a really tasty and delicious burger, i already had other burgers for less price in other places, so i had big expectations!! "
"after a nice walk in glorious sonsbeek park on the outskirts of arnhem, i went into the city villa, perched beautifully on a parkland hill, for a bite of lunch. its a pleasant place for lunch or for dinner. i sat in the orangerie. id have liked to write a really good review but "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"we came here as a family of four for high tea on mothers day. after being seated, we waited for a full 30 minutes before getting served a small bowl of soup each. another 45 mins later and after asking the server twice when we were getting the next dishes, we finally got our food. the server practically threw the plates on the table and disappeared without explaining what the items were. i overheard another waitress for the table next to us telling the guests what each of the food items were so it was disappointing we werent extended the same courtesy. also our high tea wasnt served on tiered platters as i expected, which detracted from the whole experience. (i asked when we paid why we didnt get our food on the tiered serving platter and the waitress said they ran out of them). we werent asked once during eating if everything was ok, if the food was nice etc. i understand it was busy but this was unacceptable. the service was subpar to say the least. such a pity as the surroundings in the park are beautiful and the food was reasonable. the white asparagus soup was very tasty. we wont be returning."
"the slow stew roasted pork was dry, the tuna was like defrosted tuna from a supermarket and the duck was also dry and i’m not a professional cook but i can cook same food better. i think this restaurant is very overpriced. "
"recently weve had diner with 12 people in one of the separate rooms. the menu was oke, nothing special. it felt like a 13 in a dozen one. at the same time there was a wedding party which they need to serve. we had to do our own drinks, organizing the table setting etc "
"made a reservation for lunch. there happend to be some miscommunication and instead of properly handle it, the staff was rude and not helpful."
busy place on this nice april sunday afterno 
"not a bad place especially when the sun is out on the terrace. it looks ambitious but is a little would be, service very wellwilling but not very experienced and no eye for the table. getting attention for wine and water was really anneffort. food is good but not surprising. price on the high end."
"this lovely spot is no longer accessible for us, as the staff will only give people access if they dine. and if you are in a wheel chair: shame on you, but sorry, can not accomodate you -even on the terrace-! heard this three times on different occasions. a disgrace to arnhem!"
"de boerderij is a very nice location next to the park sonsbeek, in a fabulous surrounding. the restaurant personally visited and known for over 30 years, has changed several times from ownership, management, whatsoever. the quality hasnt been always as superb as it has been in the early days, but this place for its entourage is really worth your visit. nowadays when lucky you can enjoy an excellent dinner ."
"the boerderij is located on the edge of sonsbeek park in arnhem, a truly stunning setting with a great terace for outside dinners, dutch weather permitting. i have had dinner here a couple of times over the last year. the interior is a nice mix between authentic farmhouse features in a contempary design. funny though how the comfortable chairs seem to a few inches too low to sit at the table properly. the staff is an interesting mix between the regular management and some youngster who really try hard. management seem to have lost the real desire to give you a superb guest experience. the menu offers traditional choices, in the autumn often a variety of game. allthough the food is well prepared it is a basic or perhaps i should say safe choice of ingredients. well prepared and good quality, but not very exciting. the weakest part of the experience is the wine list, and the lack of advise. it almost feels as if they are not really interested in wines. yes there is a selection with a choice of spanish wines, but i cannot discover a filosophy. the wines chosen from spanish region are mediocre. the one great bordeaux is the sélection madame du château cantenac 2007, also the only half bottle on the wine list. not a great year and ofcourse far to young to drink. serivce is too matter of factly, not bad but not outstanding. overal a nice place that just doesnt reach its potential."
"the owner refused to let us in. when she saw the two baby pushchairs, it was completely impossible to have lunch. although the restaurant was almost empty. unbelievable..."
"what an old biddy that runs this place. rude beyond description. walked in with my husband and was glared at by some old woman behind the bar. we went in for a coffee. eventually she came over, my husband orders coffee, but i wanted an americano as the coffee is too strong for me. my husband goes up to the counter to change the order and the old bat got flustered beyond belief saying she doesnt speak english. fine...my husband tried to explain in dutch. she wanted none of it. she brings a regular espresso type coffee and then he explains again that perhaps the glass they serve tea in along with some hot water would be possible? she had a dam fit! all the while saying she doesnt speak english and was visibly annoyed. i did end up with more hot water. we did need more milk and my husband went to ask for more. she said she already gave us some and was very annoyed. after we were done, my husband, whose roots are dutch with all relatives being dutch, went up to pay and said nicely in his broken dutch that he was trying to communicate with her in dutch and she was very rude. she said she did not care and he did not know how to act in a restaurant in holland and that dutch is the language of holland and we should know how to speak it. she said she ran the place for 54 years and it was her place and we should learn how to act properly in a restaurant in the netherlands. never have we come across someone so rude. ok that she obviously doesnt like foreigners, but why have a restaurant. time for her to retire. we have never met such a rude individual and our dutch relatives and friends are not even close to this way of thinking. will never ever go back and we hope people will refrain from giving her business. avoid at all costs. she was also visibly rude to other guests that were there."
very bad experience provided by the old lady serving. felt uncomfortable and unwelcome by her. she should retire!
"we wanted to eat at a local place and decided to eat here because the menu at the door looked very enticing. unfortunately the reception was icy and the service was slow and uninterested. got the drinks wrong, meat was well done and not rare. were not offered more drinks or desserts. very disappointing."
we have been here for lunch on the 2nd of january. the staff was friendly and the food was o 
"service was poor, it felt like we were not welcome, but that could also be due the fact that there were only 8 guests in total. the restaurant was a ghost town, and i understand why. the food was the worst, the meat was not even good enough to feed to a dog. you can get better food at the local snackbar. also be aware that no one talks dutch here, so english on "
"let me start off positively. beautiful place, great ambiance. have eaten here 3 times and the quality of the food varies. once everything came together very nicely. all good. but the last time it was a total trainwreck. waited for the food for over 90 minutes, the orders were wrong, service terrible, and the food was below par. the reason/excuse that was given? management (or ownership) had recently changed and things were a bit chaotic. i do not know if that has been cleared up and i wont be back to find out."
"place is nice, food ok but service is a disaster. we went for business lunch with 12 people and we were waiting around 1.5 hours then only 12 meals were delivered and one colleague had to wait another 10 minutes. not recommend for business lunches."
"mothers day lunch with 7 persons, restaurant had 3 other parties besides ours. expectations shot up by the chique welcome and the classic interiors. we were surprised by the special menu which wasnt advertised on their website, however, luckily also the normal menu was also availabl "
weve been here before and were looking forward to a quality dinner. parking is easy and the terrace is well equipped for outdoor dinin 
"villa has a nice convenient location. we came for a romantic dinner and the atmosphere was suitable for a pleasant evening. however, on the terrace there was no designated space for non-smokers and our meal experience was overshadowed by unpleasant and toxic fumes. towards the evening we couldnt see our plates anymore because it got dark and there was no light except one candle per table. the service was exceptionally slow as we got our starters exactly one hour after ordering. after pointing out the delay the staff did not apologize for this inconvenience. we had to ask separately for everything: bread, salt, pepper - as none of that was present at the tabl "
the building is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. the food looked much nicer than it tasted and we expected much more for this high price tag! my meat was tough and hard to chew and some of the other dishes were pretty tasteless. a real disappointment!
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay € 50 each. would not really recommend it."
"we came as a group of 4. restaurant was full. we ordered appetizer and mains together but appetizer never came. in the menu is written that every main course is served with fries and salad but one of the friends didn’t get side dish neither extra side sweet jacket potatoes what he ordered. when we said to waiter that, he explained that they brought only 2 sides not to waste the food?!?!?! after friend ate his steak and only then his sides came. restaurant on pictures advertising small grill which you get on table and you grill by yourself but in reality you get the grill on table with already grilled meat. tenderloin steak was really dry even if it was ordered medium rare and rib eye steak definitely didn’t had more than 200 g and in menu is written 250g. all 4 of us are from catering services and we came without any expectations but whole experience was disappointing. wine was great, service was polite but not on level and prices were good. "
the steaks were good. the concept isnt bad with the small bbqs with your meat in the table . the only issue you get to a certain point that you cant breathe properly anymore with all of the bbq smoke everywhere. it may need a betters ventilation system . however the service was good 
"myself and a number of work colleagues visited last friday, food was standard, there was a variety of dishes that we ordered and all were tasty but nothing spectacular. service was good despite it being such a busy place."
had high expectations for this place but unfortunately was a total disappointment. the steaks didnt have any seasoning whatsoever and no char on the stakes. we ordered side orders which were served after we already finished our meals. staff isnt very friendly. waste of time and money!
visited the restaurant with some friend 
kind of disappointing when they were not busy and we had to wait for 1.5 hours. the ribs were burnt. fish ok.
"we were in a group of 5 and the waiters were helpful with the menu, but we had to wait over an hour for our food and most of our friends said the food was too dry and tasteless (ribs, burger). i ordered a fish and it came out with the head, bones, and skin. head i didnt mind but i didnt particularly like pulling fish bones out of my teeth. overall 2.5"
"we had pretty high expectations, because it doesnt look like an ordinary steakhouse. but the service was terrible and the meat wasnt grilled properly. no knowledge of served wines or whatsoever. and last but not least side dishes were forgotten and wrong sauces were serv "
"on the basis of positive trip advisor reports, dined at vlees last week with 15 friends. we arrived punctually, and were seated promptly. we had agreed in advance that in view of our numbers we would be limited to a choice of two starters, two mains and two desserts. initially service was ok - we ordered starters and wine, which were served in a reasonable time. the garlic soup and carpaccio were both judged to be very tasty. things then ground to a halt, as we waited for our steaks, which despite our chasing arrived a full two hours after we had been seated. during this time several tables around us had arrived, been served, and departed. most of our steaks were cooked as requested, although not very hot, but my medium rare ribeye was seriously overcooked, and had to be sent back and replaced ( another 10-minute wait!) eventually, some three hours after our arrival, we finished our meal, and paid the bill. no apology was given for the dreadful service, and we were disappointed to be charged for our bread, which we only ordered to keep us going during the long wait for our steaks. overall our dining experience was extremely disappointing and fell a long way below our (high) expectations. the food was (eventually) ok, but the slow service, and particularly the poor management response, left a lot to be desired!"
"great food (try their amazing bitterballen) and beer. unfortunately, there wasnt an english menu and not all the waiters were able to translate some things to us. our orders got lost twice, so it took more time than expected to get our food."
"the food selection is very wierd, difficult choices and no simple stuff like a torsie or broodje kroket. secondly there are no heathy things on the menu. the most healthy choice coms with gefrituurde kip. sometimes owners choose funny choices to stand out but sometimes simplicity rules!! also thh no e restaurant was cold. i wanted to work but went home instead "
nce location to sit and have drinks with friends. the restaurant is situated central of arnhem. is next to the bus stop and 5 minutes walking from the train station.
the staff sometimes cannot see the customers and let them wait so long. the cheese platter is not suitable for non-dutch people. cocktail is okay.
"the glass of my boyfriends favorite beer got smaller. the waiter explained that it didnt, but it did get significantly smaller and the price was the same，but we still spend over 100 euros to show our love，the most crazy thing was that when we walked out of the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted to go back and use the restroom, the waiter at the door said he was not allowed to enter the restaurant because he was not dressed nicely ( he was wearing his errea sweatpants and we just spent over 100 💶 there) we’re so sad and disappointed, bye bye stan "
"the food was top notch, the sevice was terrible, im guessing by other reviews this does not happen oftern, but it happened to me. i will not go to much into the weeds, as this place had great food, but i had little to no service, left for ages to eat, no follow up, food missing, my order was not as requested, waitied ages for bill, gave up and just went to pay my bill. told the young chap about my experinace, apoliges for the bad service, asked do you think he should speak to his manager, silance and nothing, gave up. if this was a training week for staff, i hit it bang on, shocking service, but im guessing a one off."
"not sure why it was crowded. ok the quality if the drinks are not bad, but pricy and services is bit arrogant"
"this place has everything to make it great. location, great food and drinks, nice ambiance. the whole letdown for me is the service. they always seem understaffed and the staff that is there seems to lack the capability of seeing what needs to happen. forgotten drinks, forgotten menus, forgotten empty glasses. such a shame. could be ten out of ten, but is marked down for the service."
very popular bar/restaurant. the main highlight is definitely the huge patio. the coffee was good. the food selection isn’t mouth watering.
"the service was great. the place was super busy. the pretzel app was good. i had the paella and it was...well it was awful. had the place not been so busy i would have sent it back. it was so dry it was actually crispy on the top (rice, mussels, and salad shrimp) and mushy inside. "
"had dinner with friends on a friday evening, seems to be a combination between a cafe/bar and a restaurant...it was very crowdy. friendly staff, good food (had a steak), restaurant itself also looks very nice (the way its designed, decorated)."
"central to all amenities, lovely ambience, love the buzz of the crowd, but alas i found the presentation of food, and the price lacking, even too expensive for what it was.  the service could also be more friendly, we dont owe them anything!"
"it has been the talk of the town, but the quality has certainly not gone up since the beginning. service was with a great smile this time, but the surf & turf burger was nothing special on a not totally fresh bun. its all ok, but you would expect mo "
"on a good location one can find this fashionable café / restaurant. there’s a lot of choice in hot and cold beverages, cakes and food. and a nice variation in seati "
i went to stan and co with a colleague for a working lunch. our table was very close to those next to us so we felt rather penned in. the place was bustling at lunchtim 
"a new place in arnhem in an old bank building. great location and design. nice atmosphere. it is very noisy, so i would not go there for an evening out dining with intimate tabletalk! food is ok, very suitable for a quick bite or drinks with friends if you are on your way to the cinema or theatre. the service at the table was very friendly, the lady receiving us and leading to the tables had her off day. "
"the ambience is amazing, the club sandwich fish was equally amazing. i like that i was able to choose between soy and oat milk. in general all good...but the owner genuinely needs to scold her staff in private, it is beyond awkward to have to listen to when having a romantic lunch."
"this little patio has a great atmosphere. you can sit here to hide from the sun or rain. it is a cosy place. so for a dink, perfe "
"this is seriously the worst service mcdonalds of all time. slow, slow , slow...food almost always cold ....and rarely do they get the order right! its mindboggling that they get it wrong so often. this week i went there three times..and yep, they got the order wrong all three times..i guess its difficult to distinguish between coffee and tea. always 2- 3 managers  working at one time, but literally doing nothing. if you go through the drive thru, be prepared to wait forever..its quicker to fly to america then get your order here this way...and good luck getting what you actually ordered...this is the worst mcdonalds ever!"
"we visited the restaurant on a sunday evening. when we arrived at 17.30 it was still quiet but when we left at 20.30 it was packed. the interior is trendy and warm. i liked it a lot. cosy atmosphere, interesting men "
"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress über-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
"we ordered our food before we came and waited 1,5 hour for it. it took 45 minutes before they let us order our drinks and then the food came separately. very bad experience"
"we visited fika several times. if you want to have a good coffee in nijmegen , in my opinion this is a very good place to start. they have a very good coffee blend from a nijmegen roastery. along with the coffee we had a brownie - not recommended, it was like a piece of shoe sole... the personnel is okay, but nothing special. the place itself is not very nice, but is central. it tries to get a bit of a swedish style, but is just a place where the owners didnt want to invest money and this is why this location is missing the atmosphere... no background music, no colours for the walls, some basic metallic shelves (by basic, i really mean basic-like that the people putting in their garages or basements), white tiles on the wall like in a communist butcher shop. pity, this place could be something much more than that with a few more money spent for improvements - some pale neutral colours on the walls, some new industrial style shelves for the bar, some new design lamps, some music... "
"we got 3 of what they call smorrebrod on a menu with shrimp, ossenhaas and tuna. all three were very good sandwiches, but clearly the owner/cooks/waiters have no idea what a smorrebrod actually is. so food is good, but not as advertised. we had to wait more than 40 min for sandwiches. coffee was good"
"after shopping and ice skating we met at le duc for an afternoon snack. the place is clean and looks friendly comfortable. 3/5. the service is efficient and friendly. 4/5. we ordered green pea soup 3/5, bitterballen set 4/5, tok tok (chicken nuggets + fr. fries.) 3/5, white wine 4/5, green tea 3/5."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.
there are a lot of great restaurants in nijmegen. this is not one of th 
had late evening drinks here the other evening very busy one young girl serving outside working super hard and not looking like she was enjoying her shift long wait for service as you might expect good wine when it came though
"overall not fantastic customer service, but the worst of all is the incredibly long wait. 1h15m for 2 sandwiches while the table sitting next two totalled nearly 2 hours of wait. won’t come again."
"bad experience, you could finish your master degree norwegian or any other study between order and the show up of your order. apologies for the long waiting, but organisation on terrace was far below standard. one for bringing the orders, one for taking the orders, not doing anything else. resulting in endless waiting. unbalance in price versus quality, leaning over to price. a disgrace to nijmegens hospitality"
waited 40 minutes before even being asked if we ant anything and after that another hour on food.. not worth the wait or the money
last day in nijmegen after a wonderful long weekend. ordered food half an hour later was told one of the dishes was out. when it eventually arrived the schnitzel was too salty. fish was like a minnow as opposed to a sole!! at the end they didn’t accept credit or debit cards. no notice at all when you enters or ordered. most unhelpful staff
"not great - also doesn’t take card payments (except for maestro whatever that is), which is not made clear beforehand"
"the service was very slow. from the beginning to end of our three course meal, we waited a long time. even when our carafe of water was long finished, we waited to be asked if we wanted more water or more wine. i finally stopped the waiter and asked for more water. the wait to order was 15 minutes. the wait for the first course was 45 minutes! then another 30 minutes(at least) for the main course. we were never asked if everything was ok; there simply was no check in with us. it was indeed a very busy night for them, but they should have been prepared for valentines evening as it was fully booked! the starter was good. we had the salmon and carpaccio. the main was luke warm and fair. we had the choc. creme brulee dessert which was far too sweet. the lobs of white choc on top was an addition of sugar that was not necessary and in my opinion no added value to the dessert. a raspberry or strawberry on top would have sufficed. we were recommended by locals to dine here. i am sorry to say, that i will choose differently next time i am in nijmegen."
"a cocktail bar that does not have tequila is shocking! the bar service was bad but the restaurant was top class and the rooms were clean. the business meetings went well but it support for audio and video was really bad. all together, i would give this hotel 5 out of 10."
olround bowling restaurant is a bowling alley with attached restaura 
we went here to have lunch with the family group. we had ordered drinks beforehand and unfortunately after waiting a long time my cousin received a lukewarm coffee and my other cousin had to ask twice for his beer. as it wasnt included when the drinks were brought to our tab 
"really nice location in the middle of nijmegen but the standard of food is dissapointing. i ordered the hamburger, the patty tasted like it was bad quality store bought, the bun was dry and old,the tomatoes were old and some items off the menu werent available."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"the location is great, the beer pretty good, the food average to poor, but the service is terrible. ive been here a few times and either ive left because i didnt get any attention from the waiting staff, or ive stayed and had a series of forgotten orders, or unattentive waiters in general. such a shame on this nice of a location. "
i didnt manage to get the attention of any of the three servers so i left. waited for about 10 minutes
"usually, i have no complaints about this place. i really enjoy the beer tastings they do. the outside terrace is the most gorgeous one in the city. service is usually fast. however, we reserved this placed for our wedding reception for 25 people and it did not go so well... we booked the place more than a month upfront, spoke to a very nice and fast waiter who was supposed to be working at our wedding. on the wedding day, he was not there though, we got some guy who looked like he was working there for the first day. some guests never got their orders and after 20 minutes of waiting had to go inside to order again and bring the drink from the bar themselves. additionally, we ordered a big cheesecake for everybody (again, more than a month in advance). we were reassured every one of our guests will have cake. when we asked for it at the reception the waiter said that they dont have enough cake left and he knows nothing about the order. we waited for more than 1 hour 30 min until the cake was finally brought ( i guess they were baking it or buying it elsewhere). the cake was not decorated nicely, just served plain white on a white plate. usually, it is decorated. and to top it all off-the bill was wrong. they overcharged us!!! usually, a nice place with friendly and quick personnel. however, when they know they have to cater for a wedding-everything seems to go wrong. just awful. we felt ashamed in front of our guests for such poor service at our reception."
"the building is fantastic. de commanderie van st. jan is a medieval building in the center of nijmegen. there are different restaurants to choose in this building.(de hemel, plaats 1) and some other food related businesses. we had lunch in de hemel (the heaven). i chose the goats cheese salad. it was okay. nice cheese, some bacon and lettuce, with some dressing. there were a lot of tomatoes and cucumber without any dressing. the cucumber was dried out. as as said, the scenery is great, so next time ill try the other restaurant."
"i had dinner here and took the 8 course meal. i started with the bread and tapenade which was good. second round was the soup which was delicious. the next 5 dishes were fish and meat. with the fish, i could taste that it was fish from the freezer and not fresh, the meat was not cooked well. the waiters were very nice. i know that the price is not high (eur 28) but using more fresh ingredients would really improve the taste and quality of this restaurant."
"i went here for a lunch. the terrace outside is really beautiful. some of the waiters smile. this is the only good part of this place. we only ordered 2 drinks, a small lunch and one second drink. we were with 2 people. inside it was fully packed, the terrace was not even filled for one quarter. there were many waitresses. still they managed to forget the 2nd drink twice (we had to order one drink 3 times), forgot our lunch and when the sandwiches arrived (after re-order) the crockets were cold and the meat of the hamburger was cold. their excuse: it is very busy in the kitchen at the moment. so, do not go there when the weather is nice and the terrace is fully pack "
"me and my friends had dinner here and order the menu of 28,50 ( 8  course meal) which exists of meat sliced of a sword a little soup and salad, it took us 4 hours to from start to end a very very long time, the food was cooked, the pork rose and the fries very very salty - will definitely not go back here!! bad experience, been heer 8 years back (another owner then and then ik was great) - but in 2013 and up dont bother !! the beer however is super try it!"
"humphreys nijmegen recently moved to a new location. i always had good experiences at the old location. the new restaurant looks nice, but the service was a disaster! unpersonal, incompetent and slow. the restaurant is understaffed and the staff isnt well train "
had a three course dinner each for 27.95. we really were not impressed. good bread and dessert but the main dish of a mix grill and chicken was really bad. would not go back! over cooked and it didnt even match the description in the menu.
"straight forward reasonable priced meal, nothing bad and nothing extra ordinary.   lovely positioned by the river and staff very, very good, attentive, friendly and service minded."
