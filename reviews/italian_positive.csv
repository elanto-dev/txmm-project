"we ordered pizza‚Äôs on line, pizza new york and carpachio pizza tasted great and ready on time, its a disadvantage that they cooled off to much during transport home next time we will eat at the restaurant again"
"the pizza is very good, the restaurant very spacious, and the service is also good. nothing bad to say about the quality of the ingredients, which is definitely good."
"after having had some other pizzas in the same village i choose to go to la piccola...and man what a great place this is. yes its small and cosy and has great tasty pizzas, great ambience, great service and nice looking cooks ;-) . id say keep on going anne (the owner that service you)!"
"what a great place. the owner was extremely friendly, serviced good food and the atmosphere was brilliant.  would definitely recommend to all wanting to fill that gap."
"this place is great. the pizza iz pretty good. the wine is not terrific, but passable. if you want ice cream for dessert, he will go across the street & get it at the ice cream shop & bring it to you. yes, the best part about this place is the owner, who is a retired merchant seaman. he just does this for fun. dont be alarmed when he takes a seat at your table and starts talking. hes got a silly sense of humor, and you will be happier after your chat with him! if youre a snob, have no sense of humor, think too highly of yourself or dont want a stranger chatting away at your table, dont come here. for the rest of us, its a great, friendly spot!!!"
from outside hard to realise but going inside you see a well situated restaurant with a very nice terra 
"visited with my husband, daughter, son in law and 5yr old grandson. from the moment we entered we were made to feel very welcome. the staff were friendly , helpful and professional. the food, well what can i say, it all was amazing. the seafood pasta i had was the best i had ever had full of flavour, nobody else had any complaints. yes it is a little expensive but well worth it. there is an eating area outside too. we will definitely visit again. "
me and my colleagues really enjoyed our dinner(s) at the villa borghese in amstelve 
we were staying in schipol overnight and after seeing the menu in hotel decided to eat out. found on internet this place via a gluten free app. my wife has a gluten allerg 
"very good fish, nice setting. the mix between keeping some indoors space and still leaving a lot of open room for outdoors was nice. acceptable distancing between tables given corona. not necessarily the best view but nice setting inside"
"the food was good, service alrig "
"i was in amsterdam for work but staying near schipol and searching for a cozy place to eat that was also budget friendly. wow, i lucked up and found this elegant spot less than two miles from the renaissan "
"villa borghese is located near the amstelveen town hall , in the old village and close to the lake called de poel  we decided to enjoy come good italian food and when you are in italian cuisine mode vila borghese is the obvious choice. the restaurant is modern , stylish and you can feel the mafia eating here :-) the service is friendly and excellent at the same time. the food was prepared in a true italian way."
"this restaurant has had various guises and names over the last 40 years plus. the lay out remains the same and the menu is definitely italian. its a very large restaurant ( reminds me of restaurants in turkey..rooms and rooms) but remains friendly and intimate. one of its most attractive points is the gorgeous terrace, with huge parasols/ umbrellas ( they work so well have remained eating desert, and and on the house limoncello, even during a a huge storm. when the weather is good its a beautiful sheltered spot and one forgets there is a huge motorway down the road and is transported to somewhere in ita "
"we, four adults and two young children, had a dinner at this italian restaurant and were the first customers at that day. soon the restaurant was full so i recommend to book a table in advance. there were lots of families with children there so this is a child friendly restaura "
i have been on friday and it was a great experience. i picked very italian dishes such as burrata and pasta with seafood. definitely enjoyed the dinner with my partner
"we had dinner with a group of 14 persons. we didnt order from the set menu but left it to them. they brought lots of different dishes, all pretty good and tasty food. we only skipped the second piatti because we were getting full. i loved the gnocchi! we will go back. no such thing as bad staff they paid attention and were quick to come by without asking for it. had a great time!"
"we went to this beautiful italian villa restaurant for dinner. its a big restaurant with nice ambiance. we tried ribeye, grill chicken both were nice!"
"it was my first visit with a good friend, near my neighbourhood. didnt expect much the rating is good so we tried. that evening turned out to be the best itialain in amsterdam! a combination of great value for food, sophisticated interior, every details made the big difference. not to mention friendly service. definitely will be back."
"from the moment you enter this restaurant, you can easily see and feel the higher standards of quality it offers compared to many other italian restaurants. it is very clean and spacious, with lots of room between the tables, and the lighting and d√©cor are extremely good and provide a nice atmosphe "
"if you like italian food this is the place to be, lots of choice of pizza, pasta or meat. nice atmosphere, friendly service"
"a lovely restaurant near de poel, an artificial lake. in the summer you can eat outside. food is good and it quite spacious. service is fine. all in all a very nice dining experience. and free wifi."
the food was very good and the service also very good. the place is very nice but maybe if there are some groups having dinner can be a bit noisy. even that i recommend you to go there to enjoy very good italian food.
our friends have visited villa borghese many times in the past and wanted to take us ther 
genuine italian restaurant. quite a big place but atmosphere is ok. decorations are photos of italian movie stars. never knew marilyn monroe was italian though.  pizzas are large and well filled. pasta was wxcellent and tasty. good service by friendly waiters.  will go there again.
"went here with the family. we had great food, some delicious starters (fish and meat platter and well cooked aubergine). main courses were great too, good pizza, rich tasty tomato sauce, lots of toppings and some great pasta dishes."
"had an early dinner sitting at the garden ‚Äì a lovely atmosphere surrounded by nature and a relaxed environment. cuisine is typical italian, from pizzas, past to fish & meat. good wine list and attentive service. had pasta with a glass of montepulciano and it was very good. prices are reasonable. a place to share some good food with friends and family."
lovely meat and mozzarella platter. tasty bread. lasagne was ok. very friendly interactive staff.  we sat in the conservatory but the inside looked good too.
"visited one evening and dined outside in a very pleasant area in the sunshine...lovely. waiters were very busy but still helpful and friendly. i had a pizza which was made to order and very tasty, dessert of tiramisu was excellent. would recommend."
very good place in quiet area as remote from the city centre. food is delicious and the service is perfect and quick. i visited it with my friends but i believe this place to be good for romantic dinner as well. enjoyed it very much:)
villa borghese is a older restaurant under new management since early 2016. i was with a small group and had dinner there on a monday evening. i had a reservation but it was not needed although the waiter said they were quite busy on weekend 
"i ate there with my friend and it was delicious, the people there were very kind and friendly. i advise to give it a tryüòÅüëç!"
the italian food with dutch touches served in this place is one of the best i have ever tried so far. i would highly recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the area. super deliciois and very friendly staf!
well im not much of a pizza eater. but it was a helluva day with my ongoing flight to bergen cancelled. i found myself in a lovely boutique hotel in a gorgeous su 
"when you are a poor frenchman looking for a good evening, go for it. nice and charming welcome to strangers in research for a warming ambiance."
very friendly and fast service. good choice of delicious pizzas prepared in an original pizza oven. can recommend. it makes sense to reserve a table.
everything was fine and delicious and perfect served the pizza guys know their job. better reserve for table it‚Äôs completely occupied in a few minutes
late in the evening we have zearched some good food. found this restaurant. perfect service. tasty pizza. 10/10
excellent pizza‚Äôs.  family friendly and good service. one of our favorite restaurants in amstelveen for a friday evening pizza.
"coming back from a visit to a hosptal we took here our dinner. the restaurant is cosy and the staff is friendly and helpfully. we ordered a pizza quatro fromagi, al funghi and verdure, drinks: ginger tea. the pizzas and the drinks were delicious, like in a good pizzeria in italy! we will come back for sure."
nice restaurant with a real wood oven where excellent pizzas are being prepared. the house red wine is nice as well. the staff is young but professional. will come back for sure
"...which justify the prices (av. ‚Ç¨12-14) at this friendly place on the old amstelveen high street. bookings arent taken, so dont be surprised if youre turned away or asked to wait. the menus we were given were solely in dutch, but we understood enough to make a choice, and in any case the waiter spoke fluent english. pizza and a glass of house wine cost ca ‚Ç¨20 per person."
"excellent crust and ingredients. the margerita, verdure, and gustosa (ham and arugula) are the best choices."
i have been here few times now. very nice atmosphere. very nice pizza. service good. free parking outside.
friendly pizzeria in centre of the old village of amstelveen. staff friendly. pizza prepared by italians in wood oven and italian red house wine was perfect. price very reasonable   16‚Ç¨ for pizza and two glasses of wine. easy relaxed restaurant. highly recommend.
"restaurant has great atmosphere and staff are most friendly. pizzas are made in a wood fired oven and are no doubt the best in town, bar none! highly recommended!"
"this italian restaurant with its traditional pizza oven in the open kitchen is a very nice addition in amstelveen so called oude dorp. yesterday was our 3rd visit of which the second time with kids. this visit we took as a starter the misto tagliere, which is a nice variation of meat, grilled veggies and cheese. the menu is not very big with 12 pizzas on it however this makes it a little bit easier to choose. sufficient and friendly staff. our kids were already looking forward to the pizzas and even more to the kids desert. we will be back for sure."
"definitely the best franchise pizza in town .  quality was consistent with the north american stores , though it is a bit pricier than other shops in town."
we regularly order from here as it is my childrens favourite pizza. the ingredients are fresh and tasty and the pizzas come quickly. there are lots of offers so you can get a bargain.
"we just want a simple dinner when we saw papa johns pizza. we order one and it was prepared quickly for take away. it was hot, nice, and delicious. perfect for hungry stomach.."
"we have been living in germany for the past three years. when i seen a papa johns motor bike i was super excited. we ordered a large pizza. at first we were skeptical about it being authentic. the pizza arrived on hot and on time. it even came with the signature garlic sauce and pepper. the taste was amazing. i felt like i was in america again. we were sad that we didnt order two. if you are in the area, order from papa johns!"
"after 3 times in italy and many ice cream, trust me this is the best ice cream . try the strawberry ice cream , the pistaccio and the banana"
just great handmade ice-cream. a lot of different and very tasteful varieties. also very helpful and interested staff. all in all great stop for a nice ice-cream.
the last view weeks we ordered delivery from  the italiaan restaurants in amstelveen area that deliver to our home and this one is the winner. tasty pasta and well made pizza. only negative is that the delivery took long but it was worthwhile the wait.
"we were staying across the road whilst on a rugby and whilst helping heineken boost its annual turnover we got a little peckish. this was a little gem of a place, great food and was happy to customise pizzas to accommodate our british pallet. really friendly staff and great food give it go. the waiter asked if we wanted garlic on the pizza, boy did we get it. made a good pizza in to a fabulous one !!!!"
"the atmosphere and food are very good.  staff is friendly and the child friendly. pizza, pastas, entrees with many choices.  quality of food and level of flavor has always been high."
"we enjoyed the food here, its very italian, tasty and very reasonably priced. pastas are good, meat as well."
"absolutely one of the best italian meals we‚Äôve had! the cherry tomatoes with burrata in warm olive oil, linguine truffle creme done by the table, cooked in a solid cheese bowl and the warm service from this family from napoli, were just a wonderful treat on a cool spring evening in amstelveen. highly recommended! we are sure to find our way back there again."
one of the best meals anywhere  italian done very well . superb flavors. 6 of us for a business dinner and no issues only complements  tirimasu to die for and veal outstanding
really nice and cosy italian restaurant. good and friendly servive and outstanding food. have been there twice already and will come back again when i am in the area.
the best pasta i have ever eaten!  very delicious. kind service.  i will be back there soon! cant forget that taste üòç
"the best italian food around amsterdam ive had so far. the staff is really friendly, and the food is to die for. the menu is so extensive, you have to go back there multiple times to try everything."
went there for dinner and lucked out to find a seat. i had the carpaccio and the pasta .....which was finger licking good. my wife ordered a salad which was also awesome as was the lamb chops my friend ordere 
i love this carbonara ! and i like this veri sapori family. the busiest restaurant in amstelveen. need a reservation.
a gem of a place! home away from home by all means. and the highlight of a superb dinner was the sgroppino made by mario himself at our table. an amazing italian cocktail..
"....make sure to visit this secret hideaway! stuck in the suburbs of amsterdam this local hangout serves mouthwatering italian dishes. as they make very clear before you enter the restaurant, they don‚Äôt serve pizza. well, you don‚Äôt miss the pizza for a second. fresh prepared dishes served with a smile. this family really loves what they d "
we were able to be fitted in after coming after 21.00. very busy but also very good. i would like to return there soon. nice people owning the restaurant and serving.
when going to amsterdam on business trip ive never imagined that i could find such a great place to taste italian cuisin 
ive been there two times and both were excellent. the attention was very nice and the food incredible. the place its not much big so it is worth to make a reservation if you wanna go there. i recommend you all to go there if you like true italian food!
what a treat! typical southern italian atmosphere with great service and excellent food. two brothers and their families who know what they are doing. a must when you are in amstelveen
"the food is excellent, the ambiance lovely. but the service is not so go "
i was early and was given a table despite not having made a reservation. making a reservation is definitely adviseable as the place is packed every evenin 
"aouthentic italien restaurant. staff talk italien. food is made italien way, tastes like million dollars, italien hospitality, every thing reminds italy, but it takes place in amstetdam. run to the restaurant...."
"my wife and i visited veri sapori yesterday. delicious italian food, one of the most traditional you can find in the area. pasta with truffle, pasta with tomato sauce and shrimps and shrimp salad with rocket. definitely worth a visit."
"i need to go back there soon, would really love to try out all their dishes!  also go to the italian icecream shop next door, its also very good!!"
veri sapori is a small local restaurant that will surprise you with its dishes of unusual quality. the true tastes of italy give you the feeling that life is good and want to have more of it. it is a little gem you do not expect in this hidden corner of amstelveen. we have been here a couple of times and we have changed our favourite local italian restaurant to this one immediately.
"my husband and i just moved to amstelveen and came across this place by accident. we walked in on a friday evening and got the last table. the service was great, food was delicious and atmosphere was really friendly. we will definitely be going back!!!!"
"after a cold and wet afternoon, all we wanted was a warm and tasty dinner nearby. veri sapori is the perfect place for excellent italian food with cosy ambience. menu isnt elaborate but each item we ordered was executed very well. we will make this place our neighbourhood italian kitchen. do make reservations. "
"my friend invited us this restaurant, outlook of that does not give any idea. the place is not large and has limited seats. the italian family whose operates this restaurant creates fantastic tastes. steak which is sliced as small bites taste can not be explained it has to be tasted. also desserts are fantastic. everyone who wisits amsterdam must go to this restaurant "
"this a great place to seek out if you are in the amsterdam area.  good food, service and italian atmosphere. when you leave there is great ice cream shop next door, expect to join a que in the summer."
"by chance we came to veri sapori, it is tucked away in a corner and does not promise what it actually offers: great italian tastes and  an informal admosphere. try it and know you will return..."
"this is definitely a must if you are in the area. in amstelveen veri sapori is really a good quality restaurant driven by a full italian family since more than 10 years. they bring the really italian quality, not always granted for an italian restaurant, but here all is italian, from the people to the real quality food. they made dessert on their own instead of buying a standard one, the quality and the variety of all the others plates are super "
after 2 terribile food weeks in amstelveen we found very sapori at about 30 minutes walking from the hotel and seem like found a oasis in the desert. real italian food in nederland!!!  the best plqce that you can find!!!
i have eaten here a couple of times and the food always meets the expectations. i like this restaurant although the decoration is a bit poor.
a super little italian restaurant with a signature dish. a pasta dish with truffles flambeed in a huge parmigiana carcasso.    great owner and quite a wine list.     enjoy.
there is no way to go in the last minute without reservation to they great italian restaurant in amstelve 
excellent italian food. tastes like its come from italian mamas kitchen.  service is sometimes friendly. there is space for improvement.
"tucked away behind an italian ice cream parlour. nice inside and good to be able to speak italian with the staff. service is efficient, but could be a bit more personab "
"be sure to make reservations, because this restaurant is always fully booked. why? because it is so good. the real taste of italy in amstelveen. a special dish is the pasta made with parmezan cheese that is carved out of a big round parmezan cheese after being softened with burning liquor. if you like meat, the ossobuco is scrumptious. so are most of the dishes they serve."
"my favorite italian restaurant in the area. its quite a weird location, but worth the travel, because the food and wine are truly great!"
"one of our favorite restaurants for real italian cuisine. you really need to make reservations in advance, because they are usually fully booked. besides the regular dishes they always have daily specials, but my favorites are for starters the prosciuto crudo danieli; and the mixed plate with vitello tonnato, bell peppers and other delicacies. for main cours try atleast once the pasta with mushrooms prepared in a large parmezancheese. after putting burning liquor in the hollow parmezan cheese they add the pasta (already prepared in the kitchen) and than add the flavour of the chees by scraping the cheese out end mix it with the pasta. scrumptiou "
"visited this restaurant for lunch today. what a treat - run by italians and a lives up to the true tradition of good italian cooking. its not terribly big, so for the evening booking is a must, but it is open for lunch, which in the netherlands is always a bonus. we had one of the best spaghetti vongole ever and the choice of wines was equally good. will be going back on a regular basis."
this restaurant captures the true spirit of italian cuisine and atmosphe 
"after traveling regularly to the netherlands and having got rather bored of the same menu at the hotel, i was taken out to this restaura "
"having traveled to amsterdam for many weeks with work and after getting very bored of the same hotel food, i was taken out to this little restaurant. it was a tuesday evening and the place was fully booked (thank goodness we had booked a tabl "
"hadnt been to veri sapori for many years, for a number of reasons one of them being the comments about the nigh prices. and no, this is not a pizza restaurant so prices are higher. but the food and the service are definitely worth it! the vitello tonnato was wonderful: nice thin and tender slices of veal, not the dry thick cuts you sometimes get and great sauce. the other starters were just as good and the main course ( which 4 of our party of 6 had) of risotto with scallops and green asparagus was so go "
we have eaten in this restaurant many times and not once were we disappoint 
"the location is horrible, but the food is gre "
"the first day in amsterdam and the first pizza here, it was the best pizza weve ever ate and the waiters were so lovely!!!thank you !! i can only recommend it :)"
"we come for a date night, all the dishes was great and tasty , the service was wonderful . we come back 2 times after!! we will come back next time !"
"we were a bit concerned when we got to the address using google maps. it took us to a nearby shopping complex which was part closed and a bit run down. most people were eating outdoors but it was still quite cool in early may so we ate inside with one other table occupied. in the end the food was delicious - we had the assorted meats antipasti and the crostini, both of which were very nice. our son had pizza which looked good, my wife had ravioli which she said were delicious and i had lasagna because i needed some comfort food! it was the real deal with rich cream and tomato sauces. the panna cotta was homemade, had a good wobble but lacked a little flavour. we had a bottle of chianti which was very nice though a little pricey. overall a genuine italian experience."
"i can highly recommend this dolce verona. there were six of us:  four adults and two children and we all were very satisfied with the food, atmosphere and service. thanks :)"
"the atmosphere is warm and friendly. it is home-style restaurant, located in a quiet area in amstelveen, near by amsterdam. we karpaccio, steak, pasta."
"after an incredible day in amsterdam, we decided to cap it off with a visit to the restaurant recommended by our airb&b host: dolce verona. we had no expectations, which made the marvelous evening we had even more surprising. we were greeted and seated by jj, our waiter for the evening. he was very concerned about my wifes food allergies, and went to great lengths to recommend menu choices that were safe for her. his good humor, charming personality, discrete but thorough attention, and intimate knowledge of the menu made the evening special. his equally personable colleague eva visited several times to ensure things were going well. the kitchen has some very talented chefs. we ordered homemade minestrone, which was delicious and generous. my wife had the salmon, which was grilled to perfection and served with a delicious sauce and excellent fresh vegetables. i had the lasagna regina, cooked al dente and smothered in a flavorful bolognese sauce. dessert consisted of several house-made specialties that outshone all previous versions in other restaurants. the wine selection was appropriate, and the coffee after dinner marvelous. the combination of kitchen, service, and ambiance rose above most restaurants wed previously visited, and we immediately booked a table for the following evening. i rarely offer five stars, but but dolce verona deserved every one of them."
"the food was delicious, as was the wine. the price of food was more reasonable than i first anticipated. staff were friendly and attentive. would definitely go again when i return to amsterdam"
"nice service, quick, good food, i had half pizza and tortellinis with truffle sauce. this was quite ok. sauce was very good, the waitress was very nice and the prices are really in the good average. to be recommended"
"calm and nice place with very very delicious italian food, very helpful servants, you shoul try it and then pray for me ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"great place, excellent service and very italian taste! its good place for couples, family visits and friend reunion."
"perfect pizzas,great meat dishes,ok service.nice restaurant with a good food,have no home wine only the wine in the bottle."
we love taking our children to this restaurant. always good service and the food is great quality. would highly recommend for a great value meal. we particularly like the carbonara and pizza
i had dinner here with a friend. the menu consisted mostly out of numerous pastas and pizzas. but the good stuff is found in the meat dishes. we started our dinner with a big plate of antipasti for two. but in reality this was easily enough to feed three peopl 
we were recommended this restaurant by the owner of the b&b we stayed at nearby and it was exactly as he described it. a vast range of pizzas (i have never seen a menu with so many different kinds of pizza!). clearly very fresh ingredients and the staff were all very friendly. definitely recommended.
"we had something to celebrate and went with 4 people for a dinner. when we made the reservation we were advised to change our arrival time a little since also a large group came at the same time. always nice if they think ahead! when we arrived we were welcomed very friendly and we could choose where to sit. they didnt mind our baby and were very friendly to the baby. good and timely service, very good real italian food, friendly people and a real good price. like in italy they dont mind if you order a pizza which is not on the menu. even gluten-free for my wife was no problem."
best pizzas ive had in my life so far. has a section where kids can play until the food is served.
"stopped for lunch on our way to a football match. great choice, everybody happy with their choices and would come back again next time in doetinchem"
we had a delightful time with friends at this italian styled restaurant. i ordered the lasagna with salmon and it was excellent. all the pizzas that passed me by to other tables and my friend looked very good but my stomach was just too small to eat more. i also had the sou 
italian restaurant stretto (eten & drinken) is situated close to the market square in the centre of doetinchem. when we visited them we were lucky with the weather and could sit at a table on the terrace. where you can observe all the passers-by and have a great meal at the same time 
"great pizzas and atmosphere, polite crew and helpfull,in the heart of the city and also nice terrace"
"the service is quick, polite and helpfull. the pizza tastes very nice with a crisp crust. nice place to go with your family"
we tried pibia without specific recommendation but were not disappointed. we received a warm welcome and enjoyed the food. you can opt for many different pizzas and also listing of ice cream variations is impressive. for us a pleasant experience.
"i am a long time customer as my family. we had some complaints but they always solve it in a good way. the food is good and the pizzas are great, my son loves the 50 cm ones. we ate at the (new decorated) restaurant, and also order in a lot. also delivery time is gre "
"for us italians living abroad is not easy to find a place that really makes you feel at home, but il caminetto does just that. fresh ingredients and italian products cooked amazingly by the young chef, a traditional menu but with also innovative recipes, great wine and most importantly a very warm and welcoming atmosphere! a real italian dinner, ended up with dolce, caff√® e ammazzacaff√® accompanied by a lovely chat with the owners and waiters. totally recommend it!"
"visiting this restaurant very often, food is allways nice and fresh. shefs are really good at their job, staff is allways friendly. i wish there was more chicken dishes. overall 9/10"
to go short: this is a good italian resto. good menucard. you can pick one from a good range of starters and main courses. service is friendly and fas 
"all pastas and pizzas are of excellent quality and diversity. fresh products, very good service and a hands on owner."
"nice food, friendly service. outside seating is great, inside can be a bit noisy, but the food and wine are excellent. this place is recommended..."
"salvatore, liesbeth and their crew serve genuine italian food. you can choose from a range of lovely menus. from antipasti, pizza and pasta to fish and meat platters. when youre in a hurry skip the starters."
"what can i say? its a pizza place, and the pizza is good. they have all your usual topping with a few more uncommon ones."
the prices were excellent and the pizzas were very good.  even though it was very crowded it didnt take too long for our pizzas to get done.
"new york pizza serves excellent pizza for a great price, especially at take away. love the gyros pizza with tatsiki"
june 1st iza reopened its doors. it was a sunny day and we could enjoy their terrace with a nice antipas 
went for dinner during a weekday. the food is very good they had a new menu. we started of with dates and bacon out of the oven. very tasty. than we both had a pizza who was quite good as well. good place for a decent dinner. ambiance is industrial and situated near the water. very very nice. we enjoyed our time here and will be back for sure.
"the restaurant has an outside terrace, but that was unfortunately closed. staff is quite young but very friendly. food is good italian pizza, but also the normal secondi piatti. it tasted quite good! the restaurant serves french fries with the italian dish!"
we checked in for dinner in this restaurant in the historical fortress of hellevoetslui 
"we were there o the hellevoetsluis fortress days, so it was very busy and all tables were reserved. but despite that, the service was fast and friendly. the food was very good;my granddaughter had a salami pizza from the childrens menu which was excellent! the restaurant is on a nice location with a terrace with beautiful view on the harbour with museum ships and marina. the good service, very good food and nice location we liked best."
"we where with a large group and had a high top. the service was friendly and fast. the drinks we ordered arrived very quickly! the food was oke but not very special. the pizza quattro fromagio was for my feeling not with 4 cheeses but oke it is the way it is. conclusion nice place, good service / friendly and oke food. "
there are many ways to fall in love with someone. but there are also many ways to fall in love with a restauran 
"we had diner on the 17th of september. the food is good. modern dishes with lovely, fresh food. staff is very friendly."
"a large party of aussies and locals, we dined here because we wanted a special night with our extended dutch family. we were not disappointed. really great italian food, great ambient and service, and a very ni e aelection of wines. everyone agreed that it was a top class evening. definitely recommended for a quality evening."
"we love this place,  decent service,  ok to bring your kids,  good food and great atmosphere.  we have made it out go to place when we dont want to cook for the night.  good pizza and a cold beer,  couldnt be better."
"located right in the marina of hellevoetsluis, very nice area to go for a stroll after dinne "
no standard pizzas and pastas but a proper modern italian restaurant! also good for lunch or a drink after work.
they have a little card with season meals. if you want to try something you can choose for a meal with little portion for two persons. nice. free wifi.
they have a good italian kitchen. in summer you can also sit outside and have lunch or dinner. or just relax with a cappuccino or a glass of wine.
we were looking for the restaurant when suddendly it appeared across the water. some nice outside lights are giving the old building the glamour which it deserves we enjoyed a 2 course dinner at fortezza which was perfect and more than enough.
my family and i visited la gondola on our way through nl. found it on tripadvisor.   the food was tastefull. not the very best italian food we ever had. but still very good.
great and fast service. friendly and good organized staff. great and tasty food. super environment and location. open kitchen.  i think the largest and best restaurant of lemmer.
best pizza in all of amsterdam zuid for sure. like italian bodem thin but crisp great fresh products all self made
i was on my own in lemmer and was recommended la gondola! i had a lovely pizza and the restaurant had a great atmosphere and the staff were very attentive!  i would certainly go back with friends!!
"we went twice: once for a birthday and we had delicious pizza, and a second time because we liked the first! the first time we had pizza and on the second visit, i had pasta. both time the meals were fresh and delicious. they have lots of vegetarian options."
"second time i was here and all of us loved it! great food, not just pizza and pasta but juicy steaks or fish as well. service is amazing, very friendly and helpful. atmosphere is very relaxed. on top of that well-priced. and lemmer is such a cute place to visit."
"good food, although the pizza was far from being an italian style & quality.  good and prompt service, well organized"
it took a few minutes wait for an outside table and worth the wait. full menu with full array of italian options. i enjoyed the putanesca. the salad bar had lots of choices i don‚Äôt see in the u 
"this is a popular place with the locals so worth booking or arrive around 7.30pm when early diners are finishing. if you walk along the waterfront to get here you will pass quite a few quite reasonable restaurants but if you like italian food and that means more than just pasta and pizza this is the place. it‚Äôs a much bigger place than it looks, the locals enter from the other end where there is car parking. all dishes are good ranging from excellent meat and fish dishes to pizza and pasta all at sensible price "
best pizzas in town and super fast service.  they have a super big menu so it takes longer to choose a pizza then waiting for it when its ready.
"foods were really good, ingredients used are super fresh. service was efficient too. price definitely reasonable.   highly recommend!!"
"we visited this restaurant for dinner. it is located in a nice spot on the harbourside, parking is available in the area. its a big place and we were amazed by the extensive choice of pizzas in various price ranges. we tried a few and also ordered some starters that turned out to be excellent. the house wine that came with it all was fine for a reasonable price. fresh strawberries with cream topped everything off nicel "

"nice restaurant, friendly staff, amazing pizza, great italian cuisine!  right place to visit in lemmer."
"on the way home we stopped in lemmer for an evening meal. this resto was mentioned in the satnav. we had the last (non reserved) table for two, next to the bar counter. there is a lot of buzz happening. people ordering take away and people with reservation. tourists come here too we notice "
"perfect place to enjoy the canal action,the small town activity, the locals and the tourists.perfect for  a group and for a family with children.good quality, fast service with a smile."
"we were with a group of 5 and had a good experience. we all loved our food, which was the main deal. a little disappointed in the waiting staff, they seemed a little inexperienced. therefore, no 5 stars, but the food wouldve be worth it!"
"good restaurant in the heart of lemmer. warm atmosphere, good food, friendly staff. must visit for pizza lovers!"
"as usual the best pizzas in vecht area, thin and crisp! try the choco pizza for desert and enjoy your favourite food twice in one diner."
best pizza i have ever had! pasta specials are equally delicious. family friendly and a nice outdoor terrace. we were visiting from canada stayed in the village for 5 days and ate here for 3 of them. thanks cynthia for your wonderful hospitality!
"nice italian owner (around 65 i guess), always in a good mood. we have been there several times, for the quality of the food and the nice personell."
"good pizzas clean place, the prices of the menu are not expencive the only minus point is the position of the restaurant"
"we came there after our trip to zaane schans as the restaurant is just few steps walking from the village. it was not busy at all at 1p.m. the two waiters were super friendly. we got a table next to the window with an excellent view to the other bank of the river. they got a huge menu with plenty of choices. the food was okay, not very impressive at all. what surprised me was the way they charged us ‚Ç¨6 for two cups of water, which we think it shouldn‚Äôt be there. "
"this restaurant turned out to be an excellent choice for lunch at the end of our zaanse schans visit. the day was perfectly sunny and hence we sat in the outside (under an umbrella shade) with amazing view of the zaan river and windmills. such a peaceful place to have your lunch and savoir all the natural beauty zaanse schans has to offer. along with it, we tried two type of pastas - both were well prepared. loved the place and the food here."
the restaurant was a real surprise. it has the menu on the street with the price too so you can choose your dish before you ent 
"staff were great. salad ,cheese and lasagna,also pizza were so delicious and fresh...we loved it so much."
this was a very positive surprise during our visit to zaanse schans. the day was warm and it was nice to enjoy some lovely canneloni on the terrace outside. the food was amazing and very authentic and such was the service. absolute must visit in zaanse schans. 
by the end of a wonderful day in zaanse schans is good to have a break on a terrace looking over the canal and have pasta or pizza with a beer. we were 10 frinds but does not seems to bother them. the orders came quick and the food was ok. you can see also the bridge nearby closing for traffic in order to be lift for large boats to pass it. enjoy!
"the nicest little place, to relax, have a beer, coffee, an excellent pizza,  and one had to try the tiramisu."
the menu has good variety of italian dishes to choose and the food was also very go 
"very nice boat trip you can buy a ticket while visiting the zandschaans it takes you up the river zaan and it points out all the old industry that still exits along the zaan and the barges that still bring the products that the factories need, on the orher side of the zaan you see lots of typically dutch zaan houses, the canal trip is not expensive, and you get to see the zaanse culture, the boat trips in amsterdam by tours & tickets are much more expensi "
excellent restaurant and very friendly staff. the menu is very good. we indicated the restaurant. great experience.
we were lucky to get a table next to the water.  so we had a great time having excellent pizzas and very good local beers.
are you hungry and you want a delicious vegetarian pizza?? try this italian restaurant with great service a great prices!
coming for business i stayed in zaandijk. this italian restaurant with the best view has the perfect pizza! after just having a beer at the terras and seeing all this great dishes i decided to have dinner here and that was a good choice. the waiters are very polite and working really hard. but they give everyone attention and having fun with each other. a pearl across a great view is worth trying. i would definitely recomend this italian restaurant if you visit the netherlands!
after seeing zaanse schans we saw this beautiful terras accross the bridge. italian restaurant il mulino in the netherlands. as italian we wanted to try this. perfect italian food made by a cook from roma italy. the people working are really having fun with each other and you can see they are like family. we took 7 pizza and it was like eating at home in ital 
"old dutch pub ambience with a good taste. the food is as well very tasty. high level service, the people is serving attentively. reasonable price. probably the best poffertijes we had in holland."
"i nearly always go for a calzone (frutti di mare alla gorgonzola) and was not disappointed. mine came promptly and was very generously filled with the usual mussels, tuna, and prawns but also delicious smoked eel and spanish peppers to give it a kick. nice surroundings and efficient service. recommended."
"we have vouchers for this restaurant which is part of the hotel next door. nice service, but when busy it takes a while before your dish arrives. this was not a problem at all with a quiz handed to my son to keep us occupied. all in all a good place to eat."
"as hotel guests, we had complete breakfast there. coffee/tea, bread, yoghurt, and all kinds of jam. on the afternoon, we had broodje hawaii (with pineapple) for lunch."
"nice dinner with parents, fish and meat all vers nice. small but vers nice and welcomming. my doughter drew on a linnen napkin by accedent... no troubles at all‚ò∫Ô∏è"

"very nice restaurant. great pizza and pasta, fresh ingredients, artisanal good. loved it. great service also!"
great pizza here would definitely recommend for the pizza. sat in the cafe area at the front. coffee ok but you can get better.
we were fot a coffee and cake. they had ice cream and frozen yogurt. everything was delicious and the owners are very nice
its a coffee shop. they have also frozen yogurt and ice cream. they sell also cakes baked in bakery in arnhem but it was very delicious
"discovered by accident after walking past the white house (dreyersoord) (now closed as a place to see, but you can view dreyersoord from the street), and really enjoyed the gelatto and coffee - a welcome resting spot for coffee and dessert!"
we stopped here for a much needed refreshment on our bikes and were not disappointed! friendly service and delicious ice cream :)) üç¶üç¶üç¶
"took the chef‚Äôs choice- seared tuna with pesto salad with pastinak cream chips and few vegetables followed by entrec√¥te on a bed of vegetables with sauce, and dessert tiramisu/ italian ice cream. a glass of pinot gris and a bok beer. all the dishes were very tasty."

"great service, excellent kitchen, enjoyable atmosphere, cosy! we dined with colleagues for a business party. exquisite wines."
"artusi is attached to one of the bilderberg hotels, normally not my favorite type of setup. but this is different. pretty authentic and good quality italian food. good parking. but the al fresco dining is awesome. terrace faces south so sun all afternoon and evening. view of the lawns and the woods. it all has a lively but distinguished atmosphere without totally breaking the bank. pleasant service. "
"had small dinner but very tasty.  mix of italian antipasti, second homemade ravioli and as a dessert the tiramisu. friendly and warmhearted service! good wine selection."
"for sure i will keep in mind that particular dinner . i loved it so much . exquisite food - italian style - with a perfect wine , cozy atmosphere and good vibe an energy . i had as a starter a mix plate with italian appetizers, from which i can surely tell you that the chef was good . not just some salami and mozzarella but a fine touch of truffles and asparagus . quality of food high ! . as well as the oil /vinegar and all other extras which were served at the table . as a main course i had pasta which again matched my expectations . i highly recommend to try this place ."
"as with other aspects of the hotel artusi is part of this restaurant is puzzling. are we in artusi? where is the italian food? ahhh... we are in the part that does not serve italian food. set menus more based on french with a meditteranean touch it seems. as food came with our room, we had four of these set menus. unfortunately moving over to the tables where we could have italian was not possible given the arrangemen "
"had a great dinner on new years eve. fantastic italian cuisine in a very nice setting. all dishes are very well taken care off, authentic."
"the trattoria is situated within the bilderberg hotel. the cuisine is good, although not exemplary, and for a reasonable price. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable."
"first impressions werent great. the first thing it says on the menu is no sharing pizza, this wasnt ideal as we werent too hungry but after asking it turns out that you can share pizz "
great food and outstanding service! the calzone and carbonara were delicious and good value; all washed down with a carafe of excellent house red. happy to recommend this friendly place!

"i‚Äôm an italian guy visiting elburg and i tried your pizza, i gotta say that it‚Äôs very delicious. ü§åüèªü§åüèª"
its been an incredibly long time since ive had such gourmet food. really great.  i had 4 courses and every course was an experience
we are having a trip with friends and we visit elburg 
"the title says it all. i ordered the cod, which looked magnificent. the taste was even better and the combination of flavors was great. the staff was very friendly and i was overwhelmed by the extras (amuse, seasoned popcorn, etc.). would definitely recommend this place. it is wise to make a reservation as it is located on a main street and fills up quickly. "
such a nice evening in da pietro.  very original food. good wine list very decently priced. the atmosphere is great and service outstanding
"just returned from a wonderful diner with friends at da pietro. we choose the suprise menu which consists of four courses. we let these courses be joined by complementary wines. and complementary they were. after some startup problems (busy evening) everything just clicked. the service, the food, the wine. just go there and experience it."
"da pietro offers excellent food and keeps coming with surprises. location and restaurant interior are real cousy, adds to a great evning enjoying your company. staff is very friendly, doing all necessary to give you a nice enjoyable time."
"i eat at da pietro many times and held bigger and smaller parties/celebrations here, which are always exactly as i hoped for as pietro and hetty full with nice ideas and because the restaurant (interior and patio-wise) cater perfectly for it. the great thing is that you can also hop by for a shorter, casual dinner. i love that they change the food with the seasons and make inspiration-trips to pietros home-country every year to get inspired. because of this, the menu changes regularly so that there is always something new to try. absolute quality (and real-italian food) for your money."
what a great find in the lovely town of elburg. the surprise of the chef was outstanding! the pizza was superbe too but regretted not having taken something from the menu! with the biological wine and the excellent service the evening was a huge succes
"we went here to celebrate a birthday with friends - and were so glad we did! its a gorgeous restaurant in a charming little town, with a beautiful terrace in front to spend a sunny sunday afternoon (though inside is lovely and cosy, i can imagine its perfect in winter too!) the food is italian, with unusual regional specialities and favourite family recipes. on a sunday they lay the bar out buffet style, with a fantastic array of dishes - im still dreaming of those baked eggs in tomatoes and leeks! take a plate and go up as often as you want. we were completely stuffed by the time we left! as vegetarians, we were thrilled to see how many options they had for us. brilliant place with fantastic, friendly staff (thank you hetty and gerritjan - hope we spelt that right!) "
"recently visited this restaurant with my friend. the restaurant has two ding rooms, the main one at the entrance and one at the back. the one at the back is more pleasant, but we ha door place reserved at the entrance. we went for the 3 course menu and for the main meal we had the pesce rosso (roodbaarsfilet) and the pettine di vitello (kalfsoester). the first one was very good, the latter a little bit chewy. we enjoyed it a lot. the service was great and we even even enjoyed a free limoncello at the end. we will surely be back again...."
great tast experience. friendly hosts. make sure to make an reservation otherwise you will be disappointed. tip try the brunch on a sunday mind blowing good !!
"on the way back from a business trip north we diverted to da pietro in elburg, which is rumoured to be one of the best italian restaurants in gelderland and wide surroundin "
was nice food and delicious no fries we had a entrecot   and it was  nicely prepared just a pity that there is no sharp knife immediately add a sharp knife to this type of food we  where happy and  thats  the  most importend
"great outside terrace where you can have a great meal. menu has a nice selection of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes. the menu is mainly italian based. however other dishes are not italian influenced which makes the selection quite larg "
we ate at lucca twice last week during a break near elburg. there were around 20 of us in the party and every single one of us left happy and satisfi 
a good coffee and very good service although they also do food - pleasant position by the harbour to watch the world go by.
"lucca is located in a converted warehouse just outside the old fortified city centre of elburg, overlooking the harbour. the renovated interior has a modern, spacious, yet warm and welcoming feel to it. we had dinner on a sunday evening after an active day outside. starters were good: fresh focaccia with olio & aglio, olive oil & balsamic vinegar and tasty home made pesto, and jumbo cerignola olives. main course for the kids was pizza, they were nicely done with beautiful crust. but the real treat of the evening were the proper italian dishes: mouth watering porcini and wild boar risotto. delicious aubergine with parmesan roast. and my favorite: filetto in a porcini & thyme sauce. best piece of meat i have had for a long time, straight from heaven! with roast potato, red beets and roast pumpkin on the side. feeling quite full by this point we still had to try some dessert and we werent disappointed again, with the tiramisu just right and a beautiful nutella & pistachio dessert topped with delicious hazelnut ice cream. all of this brought to us by fun and friendly servers... what more could you want. elburg is not around the corner from us, but im coming back for another dinner at lucca!"
nice italian bistro. great view of the lake. good selection of drinks.  nice place to have a relax afternoon. different type of chairs and lounge to choose from. i like the 2 funky chairs facing the water. good service. i will come back.
"we enjoyed a lovely lunch today at lucca restaurant in elburg. great coffee and we had the chefs surprise, the kids chose italian style sandwiches with chicken/carpaccio. friendly service, cosy ambiance. enjoy!"
"great to enjoy italian food, specially when the restaurant maintains the no pizza standard. so its the antipasto, a primo and a secundo and the dolce afterwards. great smooth carpaccio, antipasto misto followed by some filled pasta or straight & specials e.g. their special al tartufo. the menu changes each month so dont expect the real treat, rodlofos veal liver, the fegato veneziana, to be there, but boy, did i enjoy that! the rag√∫ we had was a bit dull, had it ten times better in bologna, but you cant win them all. great open wines, fine cakes. a bit on the pricy side, but friendly professional crew."
limoncello for everybody by the owner. no discrepancy by table .  gives more klantvriendelijkheid.  see you  next time
the service and food here are great.  i will not order from any other pizza restaurant.   delivery always hot and on time and delivered with a smile everytime!
great food not too expensive. enough on the menu to choose from. great atmosphere great service. had a good time. enjoyed it.
a fantastic 3 course menu with a fantastic steak of deer as the main course !! our first time pappagallo but for sure not our last. great and friendly staff that went out of their way to make our dinner night a more than total success!
"charming, quaint and rustic italian restaurant serving  authentic italian dishes. had the carbonara and was wowed by its generous portions. only 12euros"
"last night in spijkenisse with our friend, we could not have found a better place to enjoy our last meal the "
great meat dishes and various specialties of the house. nice service at the table. very close to the center.
"very nice small restaurant, where you feel good with very kindly people who serve you; they dont speak french but they try to speak in french; food was good with nice red wine; we did enjoy eating there;"
"we went there at 7:30 pm without any reservation and nevertheless were given a large table to accomodate all of the 6 of us. food, mainly italian, was served by smiling waitresses and was excellent. the pizza was perfect. price wise it was a good choice too. "
"fantastic restaurant, not easy to find or park but worth to do it ! verry nice servents as well as ambiance! love to come back but then with girlfrind instead of colleague!"
"the four of us enjoyed a christmas dinner on 24th of december, which was a set menu, but what a treat that was, not only the food was fantastic, presentation was excellent, and staff were very attentive, and that on christmas e "
the restaurant is nice the food is very good only when there is a big crowd the service is a little less. we go here 10 times a year and is in spijkenisse our favorit restaurant.
"pappagallo serves excellent pizza in the restaurant as well as takeaway. the restaurant is also very worth while to sit down, relax and choose from several italian dishes."
"well, just as i said in the title, the serve an excellent and wide variety of mediterranean food, italian style with a friendly staff and for a good value. can be a bit crowded, though, but it is a very popular restaurant!"
this place is that good that we had to visit twice.    this is a must visit for a brilliant meal everytime
we have been working in the area and have come here every wednesday evening since we have been he 
il siciliano is a small restaurant with a very kind staff. the food is excellent and not so expensive. the restaurant is in the center of spijkenisse (outside rotterdam). after dinner you can go to the maasvlakte (new land!!) where you can see the huge seaships.
"very good italian food. great choice of pasta, pizza and many other italian foods. the staff was also very friendly."
"a simple, but very good authentic italian restaurant, with good food, friendly staff and reasonable prices. we go here on occasions, but we never get disappointed."
"great authentic italian restaurant (alto quisine). great food across the range, from pizza, pastas to meat and fish dishes. the ambiance and staff is terrific as well as is the wine card! food like one knows it from italy locally!!!"
we had dinner for a birthday party  we where very pleased by the quality of the food  the excellent service and most of all our bill very nice priced for the quality

"went here with a group of friends, and really enjoyed it. the food is simple and straightforward but good, and very reasonably priced. staff were very friendly as well. i will definitely be returning."
visited with dutch friend.   italian food was first class and very reasonably priced.   the restuarants was very busy which showed how popular the place is.   will certainly visit again.
"i really like this restaurant. the food is delicious, staff is friendly and helpful. the prices are very affordable.   i recommend it to all my friends and family all the time."
"we have been dining here for many years, food is always good quality and not expensive.  friendly italian owner.  decor has recently been updated.  also has a take away with excellent pizzas."
"la sirena offers the best pizza in the area. the ingredients are fresh, the crust is crispy. people are all friendly!"
"good food for a fair price. very friendly owner, waiters and waitresses, nice atmosphere in restaurant."
"la sirena has good pastas, pizzas and other little dishes. the restaurant isnt that big but youre not sitting on your neighbours lap. the staff is also friendly."
"good food, great service, great italian menu 100 neapolitan chef! i hope to return soon.  i recommend it to all"
i was fascinated more by the process of making antipasti and enjoying the italian language - advantage of sitting at the bar. love the sphere here - piccola italia! cannoli tasted good and veeeery sweet.
"we arrived here at 3pm on a very hot saturday afternoon. the welcome was immediate and genuine. could we sit inside? no problem. gluten free? no problem, i will tailor things on request. our needs were anticipated even in 30c heat a real keenness to serve up something specia "
"the chefs wife is celiac, so he has gluten free in hand - no worries! excellent meal starting with antipasti (no gf bread - next time ill bring my own crackers), followed by a choice of fish, meat or pasta. we opted for the sharable beef which was cooked to perfection, accompanied with arugula&parmesan, grilled veg and side salad. simply fantastic. i had a limoncello for dessert - my husband passed on the tiramisu, but it looked to-die-for. excellent wine selection as well and service was impeccable. reminded us of the naples we remembered! cant wait to return!!!"
"real italian atmosphere, it starts when you enter. it is like walking into a delicacy shop, but it is also a lunchroom. she serves great coffee and espresso. great italian dishes and sandwiches. had a nice caprese salad with two mozzarella cheeses, that is a rarity in the netherlands. real good quality, buffalo of course. nice olive oil on top of it. the sandwich (panini) was looking great too. be on time because it is always crowde "
well the title says it all. small but proper italian eatery with freshly made sandwiches and other italian dishes. also for take awa 
"i have visited this restaurant many times for lunch and dinner. i love the place especially when you can sit outside on the terrace at the back or at the bench in the front of the restaurant. whether you take a sandwich, pasta or meat/fish its always made with care and served with a smile. i personally like the pasta puttanesca the best. the portions are generous and if you take the full menu there is hardly any room for desert. however we always manage to finish it anyway, guess why;)"
"they serve the best italian food, all home-made and have great wines to pair your meal with. great staff too, it feels like a small piece of italian soil right in my own home-town"
"this italian delicacies store has a small very intimate restaurant, osteria as they call it. it feels as being invited into an italian home and having ancient family recipes being prepared for you, the guest of honor. absolutely amazing authentic fresh italian food. just.. go there! "
"really nice antipasti and pasta! pasta of the day (spaghetti with lobster) and pasta gorgonzola e noci were really amazing! the pasta was cooked al dente, tasteful and the flavors were very well integrated. for desert the limoncello cake was pretty good.highly recommended"
"a family saturday lunch. just so special at this restaurant. the chef remembered our family from about 18 months back, and exactly how the girls enjoyed their carbonara. not on the menu, but made perfectly from scratch. really really worth a visit."
popped into my local italian deli/restaurant for a quick bite. had only been for coffee before: what a cool surprise. superb italian pasta and a wonderful garden. so good one on the herenstraat in oud-voorburg. mind you: open for dinner on thursday-saturday too :)
really enjoyed my icecream with a nice coffee on the outdoor terrace of zinn. located in the julianabaan shopping centre on a pleasant little circus. service friendly and prices altogether reasonable.
very tasty! you should try it once! in general next to the delicious ice cream variety one can find delicious cakes as well as interesting warm dishes!
"simply the best ice cream in the area!! we‚Äôve tried others, but this is the best! so creamy! such good flavors!!"
this place has a high quality standard and offers excellent coffee aways served with fresh whipped cream on the side and offers home made pastries as well as tarte flamb√©e for those of us who prefer salty dish 
cosy place in the middle of the central square in voorburg. go there for their excellent flammkuchen and friendly staff.
"okay, zinn is a really cute ice cream shop. you can sit and enjoy your ice cream inside or outside on the terrace. its a very happy cosy place in white and orange. service is with a smile, very nice! besides the most delicious ice cream ever, the serve illy coffee and espresso which is one of my personal favorites and small stuff to eat like toasties, paninnis, soep and poffertjes (organic) sort of like a one bite pancake. the presentation of the coffee, tea, and everything is really nice with just that bit of extra that makes it kind of festive. its really a wonderful place for lunch with ice cream for dessert, just ice cream, a snack, coffee or tea, glass of wine."
"i have been a regular of fratelli for a few years and it has never dissapointed. i apprecciate the excellent service, the kindness and permanent aim to make customers feel welcomed and well attended."
we come here often for take away. the pizzas are great with a good thin crispy crust. they also have a salmon lasagnato die for. kind and friendly staff.
"enjoyed a lovely dinner with family tonight at il tortellino. we enjoyed delicious salmon carpaccio, vitello tonato, mushroom risotto and cheese and walnut fresh tortellini out of the oven! highly recommend the place for a casual dinner or visiting the trattoria (same lovely italian owner next door) to enjoy the delicious meals at home! "
this is a nice little place to get carryout! we especially enjoyed their prosciutto pizza! their meatballs were quite tasty as well. give it a try!
we have been coming here for years.  the pizzas are delicious and very reasonably priced. service is always speedy.  the place could do with being renovated though as it is dark and dingy and looks like it hasnt been decorated for many many years.
"ordered another great takeaway pizza at this restaurant. when it comes to pizza, this restaurant is one of my favourites!"
"having tried quite some pizza restaurants in and around the hague, we decided to give fratelli a sho "
"always good for dinner. make sure to make a reservation, as they are always fully booked. food is great. good flavours, fresh ingredients, big portions, great value! staff is friendly and helpful. wines are tasty!"
service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good and the price/quality ratio is great. i could see myself getting takeout from here since the atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired.
despite being busy the three of us were given a warm welcome. we ordered off the menu and had a few drinks and still thought the total cost was very resonable. ambience 10+ service with a smile. if anything it seemed a little warm inside. there was always seats outside if it had bothered us too much:)
"my wife and i have visited voorburg once to three times a year for the last 20 years. one of our regular visits there is to fratellis restaurant, where we always receive a friendly welcome from the maitred and an excellent meal. the service is friendly and efficient, it is cosy without being cramped, and there is a good ranging wine list. starters are generous, the steaks are always excellent, and although there is a wide range of main courses we almost always plump for one of the steaks. a well-travelled italian friend came with us once and described it as the best value italian restaurant he has been to outside italy. i would heartily concur,"
this is probably one of the better medium priced restaurants in voorburg. the staff are accommodating even if the place is busy. at the weekend there could be larger parties so pre-booking is advisable. its possible to have a pre-dinner drink outside but seating is limited. may best to aim for a meal about 18:30 as the dutch tend to eat early.
after my son recommended to taste fratellis excellent pastas we went there with the family and i totally agree that their pastas are excellent
great food. great service. great pric 
"oddly enough for the past 15 years i stop here every time i go to holland to eat their pizza. i think it is one of the best in the world. the menu has many other wonderful choices. if youre in the area, i recommend you stop in. voorburg is also a nice little village."
"fratelli have several restaurants, but we like the one in voorburg the best. early in the evening a lot of families visit the restaurant so it can be busy with children. when you visit later it is usually more relaxed. food is always a good standard as is the service. it also possible to order pizzas for take-away, the pizzas are awesome and way better than dominos, new york pizza and other pizza deliberatie companies! prices are very reasonable. "
ive been coming here for at least the last 10 years. it is ideal for quick  dinner with small kids. bu sure to make a reservation in the weekend. the place is packed until 8:30.
our experience at fratelli was very good.. as a fan of italian food i would surely recommend it. the waiters were very nice. he recommended an appetizer for us and it was very tasty.. all our orders of pizza spaghetti lasagna soup appetizers and everything was tasty 
cosy little place with good food. calamari and pizza with a beer. olives to the table to get me started. nice window seat to watch the world go by. would return if back in the ar 
"surprisingly good pizza. delivered exactly on time and still hot. fair price. go for it. the salad was average, but our expectations for delivery salad are low."
"the restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere and the staff is overall friendly and helpful. they do not, however, always have the wines that you ask for. the food is of good quality, especially the pizzas. definitely, recommend it, but it would be smart to either reserve a table or go monday-thursday night, as friday-sunday nights tend to be extremely busy."
"good food n good service, well priced, helpful waiter, good pizza, good wine. you should try for dinner at this restaurant. good atmosphere as well."
"i know i am a bit too late to write a review about this restaurant, i visited this place during my holland visit in 2008, but i am writing this, believing, that its never too la "
"been awhile since i went back to donati. today was exceptionally good! maybe the chef was in a good mood today! had my usual spaghetti carbonara, and it was splendid today! taste was exquisite to the letter! also loved the calamari fritti before my main course!"
one of my favorite restaurants. always went with the spaghetti carbonara. service fantastic but make sure to reserve a table in advance if you go during peak hours and days.   today tried the warm molten choc cake too. awesome!
"at donati, the food is prepared with good, fresh ingredients. the flavors are good and the menu makes sense. service is very friendly and attentive. the wait staff are young but professional. the atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, it is laid back and lively but not too noisy. just right. i found the wines a little expensive, but overall our meal was reasonably priced, very tasty and very enjoyable. we will be back!"
"spaghetti was good for me. went there 3 times in a week! good location, car park easy. good atmosphere and good service too."
good (but not great) italian food in an uninspiring restaurant. interior needs some tlc (certain parts near the kitchen and toilets even look a bit tired 
what do you do when the sun shines and the temps is around 24c: you have your lunch on the roomy terrac 
"had a nice dinner here, friendly staff and a pleasant atmosphere. liked the tiramisu desert. surprisingly full for a wednesday evening üòÄ"
"donati is always a good option for a romantic dinner or a nice gathering with friends. the food is excellent, attention has always been payed to details, i particularly like all the raw and grilled fish and seafood dishes. the staff is also kind and friendly. i simply love this restaurant. "

you can drop by for a coffee to go (or stay) or order via de special leut-app when youre in a hurry. your order will be ready when you arrive.
i love these pizzas. they have a delivery service very fast. the pizza is perfect! i recommend this pizza shop.
"we visited this pizzeria in search for a quick dinner bite without a long wait. the pizzas were very large and tasted excellent. moreover, it was no problem to take the left-overs with you. only disadvantage is that they dont serve alcohol, hence no beer or wine to join your pizza ... many people came for a take-away which is well understood!"
"good food for a good price, nice personal nice menu. in the middle of the old part of houten nice terrace available under big trees"
we were here some time ago and went back and found this restaurant nicely renovat

we always visit this restaurant whenever we cycle into the old town of hout 
was surprised to find a lovely restaurant like de roskam in the centre of old hout 
"the roskam is very well known because of its location, in the center of town, with a nice terrace where to enjoy a bit of sun with a glass of wine and some bitterballe "
the roskam has a modern look as well as a gezellig atmosphere. girls catching up in houten is fun too!
it is always a pleasure to visit de roskam on a sunny day youre welcomed at the terrace where you can dine or start your evening. coming inside you feel the cosy atmosphere knowing you will be treated well. there is quite a choice from the menu and the quality is very good. portions are more then sufficient and there is always a good companying wine available. the servants are friendly and are always there to help you when you need something special.

"lovely little houten has a nice village square with some nice restaurants. de roskam deserves a visit. place has been modernized but still has the traditional easy-going atmosphere of an old family restaurant. non-pretentious food, good service and value for money. worth a try!"
"we ate at de roskam last wednesday evening after work. it is in a cobbled square in the centre of houten. as it was a sunny evening we decided to eat on the terrace and were lucky enough to have a large table outside. as the evening got late the overhead heater came on and an electric awning enclosed the terrace, so it was very comfortabl "

we had pizza take out from this restaurant. it was really good and ready in 10 minutes! a really thin base and generous toppings. i had a spicy salami pizza and my husband had a tuna pizza. it was just as good the next morning when i heated up my left overs for breakfa 
had an excellent crispy pizza here from a wood-fired oven that occupies a major part of the rear of the restaurant. i intended to have a pasta but i found the menu limited so opted for a pizza instead. the pasta of the week is an extra to the menu though. the place is smallish; on an unannounced visit on a weekday we had the last vacant table.
lovely restaurant on a charming little square with free parking. a fee tables outside. nice menu with plenty of choice. friendly staff and owner. lovely desserts!
"the food is delicious, the service is excellent and the prices are good.the pizza is the best one i have had at that time. my impressions are very nice."
this is truly one of the best italian restaurants in this area.  their food is delicious and their prices are good.  service is phenomenal.
"we moved to the netherlands from belgium and have been going here a couple times a week all through summer. the ice cream is great especially lemon pie, pistachio and coffee (although i wouldnt combine those). scoop size is heavily dependent on the employee (and they seem to have a lot of different ones). overall, highly recommend."
"hands down, my favorite restaurant in veenendaal (and i have visited the majority of the restaurants here at least once "
"we every now and then pop in to this little restaurant in a not so obvious location in veenendaal. we really like the italian food, the fact that they change the menu with the season (certainly autumn is our my favourite, for eating game). kitchen is mostly southern tirol oriented. very good, tasty food and good portions. also very nice wines available, as also very nice desserts (like the strawberry tiramis "
this was probably the last sunny & hit day of summer 2019. we spontaniously decided to have dinner here. we had a nice (large) table outside. the staff is very friendly. there is a lot to choose from on the menu: from meat to pasta & pizza. you can even order a pizza with a choice of your own ingredients. the menu holds appox. 10 differents sorts of deser 
"whenever we‚Äôre looking for great italian food, we visit this place (or arrange for take-away). has been our favourite for many many years. we‚Äôre particularly fond of calzone and quatro formaggi. they have expanded and have a nice terrace too."
a quaint litte italian restaurant with an actual italian as an owner. great food and good service. the pasta was delicious.
very good italian food. no english menu but waitress was very helpful. great service and very friendly.
so good that eating out is possible again. we really enjoyed a generous pork filet and a most tasty pizza.
"walked past this place many times but only visited first time this week with family. we all went for pizza and they were amazing - just right, crispy thin crust not too much tomato sauce . we got some nice warm bread to start with for free, which was a real nice gesture. pizzas are big so i didn‚Äôt have space for dessert but some in our party did and they liked them a lot. service was also very good "
"great flavours, excelent service, fiendly atmosphere. i recomend the mango flavour and the limoncello."
"this place is located in the dennenlaan, next to bakery nieuwburg. it offers outside seating, very good ice cream of all sorts and very friendly service. worth a visit."
"good food good prices,friendly service,very helpful the menu in english,,it was clean,we order a hawaiian pizza"
"very pleasant pizza cafe in zwanenburg. excellent friendly service menu also includes english translation. we ordered the soup of the day (onion soup), pizza (no 29) and the house red wine. they brought out some olives, and warm bread, yum. good food, wine and company and enjoyed the passing views. "
good food and reasonably priced.  the service is excellent and there is a decent variety in the menu.
"its in the middle of nowhere, so we didnt have a lot of options, but it was a good experience. the waitress was super friendly, a sweet mother. olives and bread were served beforehand, nice. the pizza was fast and good."
"we had a lovely dinner here. they put us in the corner of the restaurant so the other guests wont mentioned us a lot. the food was nice, acceptable price"
a fine italian restaurant that served very good tasty pizza. if one craved for a very good one la brocca wont make you down.   i can recommend this to any everyone.
wonderful place with marvelous intetior. perfect salad minestrone pasta pizza and dolci. very authentic and friendly service. best italien restaurant around. we love it and will return as soon as possibile....
"a small cosy restaurant and an owner that wants to serve you fast, though once he figured out that we were in for the full monty and a junior waiter took over things improved. we were there for dinner and that was really good, makes sure you have a good at desert !"
"the pizza is great, but everything else is even better. love the atmosphere and owner jorgos is always a great host. dont miss the desserts!"
"the head waiter is a bit boisterous but the food is very nice and not very expensive. the place is small and often crowded, so do reserve! we live close by and have visited the place quite a few times over the years, always consistent."
italian food simply prepared and always served hot . i have eaten here several times and always receive a warm welcome
"looked for somewhere within easy walking distance of our hotel (ibis styes) so tried here and we were not disappointed. we were fortunate to get a table on easter sunday and it was obvious that the restaurant was very popular with locals, which tells a story. delicious food, i had the fish chowder, then tagliatelle with salmon and the tiramisu to finish. very friendly, helpful staff who added to our overall wonderful experience."
"loved this place. very busy, cosy and crowded - lovely atmosphere with families, couples etc. my calzone pizza was first class. offers a take away service."
"this is a lovely traditional restaurant that although small has a very friendly and intimate feeling that adds to a family atmosphere. the menu is varied and the food delicious. i had lamb, beautifully cooked and a huge starter of prawns which was delicious. carafes of good wine completed the experience. highly recommended."
"i had finished 600 km of driving, i was tired and hungry, but also very sweaty. the trattoria was completely full and many people waited outside, standing. i said to the waiter; im hungry, im a courier and i havent eaten all day. he invited me inside, offered me to drink and gave me the menu. i chose a pizza napoli to take away. they offered me drinks and they wanted to offer pizza too and i didnt accept it, because we are among decent workers. inside there are my sardinian and neapolitan brothers, the pizza was delicious and the scent that came out of the kitchen reminded me of the dishes cooked with love and passion, as the real made in naples should be. do not miss this place, you eat very well and cheap. they manage to make everyone smile, even the most depress "
fabulous italian food and great service. visited with friends who recommended it and would recommend it to anyone. thank you so much for a superb evening!
very kind host and a nice old italian vibe. the terrace is heeted in winter but if youre not close to the heaters it can still be a bit cold.
"having pizze/lasagne and vino on a sunny day has been wonderful. even if the terrace outside was overloaded, we got a place at the window inside, even better with airco on a hot day. pizze very crusty, great peppery sauce made specially for us on request through a very charming lady from south sardegna serving us. wonderful dining experience at a fair price, recommended!"
"went for a dinner for my birthday with the family. august, so we could sit outside under roof. the food was execellent, very tasty real italian. the service was very friendly and quick. we enjoyed our night out and my birthday was a succes."
during our stay in castricum we ate 2 times in this restaurant. our visit was ones around 5:30pm and the other visit was around 8pm. both times the restaurant was busy: a good sig 
what can i say? a faultless meal that we enjoyed from beginning to end. we were very hungry so we had a lot to eat! we got some olives and lovely bread to nibble on and then starters and pasta. seafood pasta was lovely - very fresh. i would say food very simple but all the better for that. really good flavours. and helpful staff.
"on the final stop of a month long tour of the netherlands, we stumbled upon this gem of an authentic italian trattoria in castricum, serving the best italian food ive eaten outside of my 3 trips to bella ital "
"the pasta parmigiana is worth a trip to the small town of castricum. whiskey is poured into a round of parmigiana, then lighted to melt the cheese. when melted enough, the pasta is added and mixed with the cheese. the result is a spectacularly rich and delicious dish. well be back for more . . . after weve worked off this one."
"together with my wife and my kid (4 years old) we were driving around and we stopped in castricum. it was fun we noticed this italian restaurant you would never think to find far away from big cities, well, we do not use to eat italian abroad but actually it was not like eating abroad because this is a proper italian restaurant. excellent food, friendly people, they did everything possible to make our experience great. congratulation to the chef and to all the team. we will come back!"
we were on one of our spontane trips to europe when we find ourselves in this small dutch town castricum.. a bit chilly to walk around in the evenings we took refuge to the warm and cozy atmosphere of la trattoria.. alex the chef owner and ugras our maitre de made us feel like in a small mediterrenean village with sincere and genuine service. i would definitely recommend this cute restaurant to whom wants to have an authentic trattoria experience in castricum..
i am italian and casually found this restaurant in a small town next to amsterdam. i was attracted by the napoletan accent of 2 waiters in front of the door and decided to stop for a dinne 
quaint little canalside b&b and cafe. we had tea and bitterballen followed by apple tart with cream. outside it is soft seating with cushions and blankets if you need them. inside is wooden tables with antique crockery and cutlery. it is adorned by a lifetimes collection of antique ornaments and pictures. 
it was really a good experience..italian style food mixed with dutch style...perfect high quality combination...you can relax and have a perfect dinner with a very friendly service....the combination between the style and the food create a perfect atmosphere...suggested!
"we visited the restaurant once more and once again enjoyed what i would like to call the serving of a wonderful meal with a human touch. not just customer friendly, but a real human touch that you experience in the interaction with the staff and in the tasting of the food. a real joyful experience in an intimate atmosphere!"
lovely place with home made food. weve visited this place during our happen en trappen trip. this was the place to receive soup and weve received a lovely home made bowl of soup. dietary restrictions are well met and taken care of. good place to go. 
on christmas day we had dinner at this lovely place. small and intimate. especially the service was excellent. the standard menu for this evening was adapted so that those of us who werent keen on fish were served an alternative. we have been to this restaurant a couple of times before and it has always been a joy! very personal treatment at a very reasonable price.
we took the 4 course truffle menu. all 4 courses were very good.  service was very attentive and fast.  wines by glass are very good.  to be recommended.

"authentic italian cooking, everything was fresh and tasty. very friendly staff. definitely  come here again!"
"ok, this is something i really love! what a restaura "
it was so heart-warming even to arrive here. nice staff and the interior even makes it better to feel yourself like in an italian familys house for a dinner. everything was sooo fresh and tasty. it was the best italian i have ever been outside of italy for sure. maybe if i count the italian ones ive been in this one is still beat them. definitely a place to visit again!
"this restaurant is touching on a higher level of italian quisine. yes they do have the obligatory pizza and pasta; but you should really go for the more sofisticated menu. great food at a decent price ,little upmarket but fine value for mo "
we stopped at asten for one night. looked at trip adviser for places to eat and decided to go for italian food. as we walked in we thought the restaurant is empty but they have back garden or rather back yard but in nice italian style and atmosphere. that was on a very warm eve so we enjoyed every minute. prices are fair for what you get. btl of house wine is just under 20‚Ç¨ - in fact white is very nice; and main course you can have for about 10‚Ç¨ for pasta and pizza or 15‚Ç¨ +for fish/meat dishes. what is more important the food is delicious and staff very friendly and made all effort to communicate with us:)
i live in dubai and i never (seriously never) eat italian outside because i know for sure i will be disappointed. also i was wondering who would appreciate italian home made food in the middle of the netherlands.. well now am wondering who wouldn 
very nice people serving good italian food. the wine that i served is a good quality wine. the prosecco we can recommedate. ouside in a lovely cousy city garden you can eat. simply good and reasonable priced.
"looking for a place to eat in a small town is not always easy. i saw 5 reviews in a foreign language that i dont speak. i gave it a try on just the ratings. yes, its a real find. good wait staff, great italian fo "
"didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, but what a wonderful surprise, attention to detail was incredible, wonderful staff catering to your every need, good wine card, food was incredible, the attention we received made us feel very special, definitely going back, thank you danny rene and your team"
we asked to our b and b where is it possible to eat at 8p 
"i found this restaurant by chance. i am italian and i am always very curious to find out the way our typical food and products are cooked in other countries. my dinner at innesto left me speechless. an extremely varied menu, sensitive respect for italian traditional dishes which are reproduced in a surprising, pleasing way. at innesto you can definitely taste quality and have an unforgettable meal. the staff is young, nice and friendly, they made me feel at home. i highly recommend this restaurant to all kinds of clients, of all ages and nationalitie "
"nice atmosphere, great dishes and friendly staff. not only the restaurant, but also a great place for venues like a wedding. absolutely fabulous!!"

we attended a wedding party here .the restaurant did a really professional job serving the gues 
had a great meal here enhanced by our charming waiter;  the lovely lady chef even drove us back to our b&b - thats service!
i ate 3 dinner here.  great service and delicious meals.  the staff were first class and helpful with suggestions and recommendations.
"had the very tasty 3 course meal for less than eur 25,- . good choise !! my partner had the asperagus √† la brabantse way , which were exelently boiled and served . "
"i dined here when staying in the bw hotel next to it. they have a seasonal menu (not sure why end march they presented the winter menu, but ok), but also a la carte choic "
very friendly and good quality tasty food. i only had a main course and a desert. everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. certainly worth visiting.
it was my first visit to this restaurant. i was in the center of bergeijk looking for somewhere nice to eat. my i fell on the italian looking name. it looked clean from the outside with some people eating. so i went in and was surprised by the place. i had only the maincourse because i didnt have much time. i chose the seabass. it was very fresh and tasty. friendly and fast service. fully enjoyed it. will surely visit again.
"we eat here very often as it‚Äôs a lovely local italian, fresh ingredients, simple and not too heavy. the staff are very friendly and super accommodating and will adapt dishes when needed. they even always bring a lovely little amuse bouche! worth a visit!"
"we were there for camping and we went out for dinner due to someones birthday and we are all italian food lover, so we found this one. review says its good and we tried already once, they were fully booked (that is why we knew it should be good as in such small town, food much be good to be fully booked for dinner still!). the food we all had are really good; if you put the reults of michelin star restaurants, this restaurant purely bring you simply good food, simple but good service; nothing else. if you are a good food lover, you would enjoy as much as we do. you must try it if you are in the neighborho "
"it was our fourth visit to this wonderful restaurant and every single visit we have been ecstatic ! i started with a delicious home made bouillon and my husband had coquilles with parma ham. as a main, we both had the saltimbocca. the taste was very italian (having lived in italy we know what that means !) and extremely tasty. we ended with their excellent coffee, although we were very tempted by their desserts, but alas, age is creeping up on as, so we try to watch our calories ! this was all delivered with a natural elegance, attention and kindness in a very pleasant setting, the latter especially now they have added their wonderful (non-smoking) conservatory."
"found ourselves in bergeyk unexpectedly and did a quick check on tripadvisor to find somewhere to eat. pleased we chose buon gusto, it was a really nice location on the edge of a market square. good range on the menu. pasta dishes looked great from what we saw of other peoples. we had veggie lasagna and victoriabaars (nile perch apparently, not something ive ever had before) - both were excellent. nice wine and beer. no kids menu - my daughter only wanted soup anyway so this wasnt a problem. i think they would have done a small portion of a main meal if wed asked. friendly service. only complaint was that we asked for desert at 10pm only to be told that, although they were still serving drinks, the kitchen was closed! would have been nice to know that earlier."
dropped in for an evening meal on a quiet sunday evening. the service was friendly and attentive. the food was delicious and the decor/ambience pleasant. best restaurant in the area by far.
"great dedicated chef, friendly service in a small restaurant on a lovely square in the town centre. i had one of the most delicious chicken dishes. my husband had the rack of lamb which he much appreciated. it was accompanied by a few stir fried (?) veg and a great risotto. their wines are excellent and many of these organic. good fresh coffee ! this was our second visit and obviously we will be back."
"overall very nice concept and tasty food (is my 3rd visit here). my absolute favorite is the mexican buffet followed by the steakhouse and the italian (which is totally nothing even close to italian but hey the pizzas are ok). there is also a very excellent desserts buffet, probably the best i have ever had in an all you can ea "
"this new location has a spacious setup. more room to sit compared to the location in velp. the food is what you can expect quality wise from a buffer restaurant. there is mexican, fastfood, italian, chinese, a bakery, fish, steakhouse. so there is something for everyone. the food is good. just hope to have a little bit of a busy evening so the food is replaced often."
"very friendly and professional staff who explained the concept of this amazing restaurant, so much choice of freshly prepared quality hot and cold foods from around the world, as much as you can eat, we were so impressed and had a lovely evening, wonderful desserts, ices, cotton candy, cakes, waffles, pancakes, bottomless soft drinks and teas coffees, huge array of different varieties, we hope to visit again and wish you all the very best for your restaurant. would love to see this in uk ."
"i live near, so every time its my turn to cook, its star-time!! delicious pizzas. they are specialized in calzones: check them out!"

"one of the more authentic italian restaurants i have been to in the netherlands (being an italian myself)  great dinner, good quality ingredients, nice and friendly service, nice ambience and well spaced out tables.  would definitely return !"
"an hour away from where we live, but every time its totally worth it. the staff couldnt be better and the chefs skills are simply outstanding. pure top quality ingredients delivering your moneys worth!"
we went already at 18.00pm and only had two hours because of the babysit. they offered us a very nice 3-course dinner and the service was really good. we love to bring a visit in the new accommodation.

decided to eat here with some friends after reading the review 
"i have really enjoyed our sunday night visit to pasta e vino: the service was impeccable, the hosts very welcoming, prepared and friendly (i was surprised by the knowledge of the waiter about the nonino grappas! actually, i was surprised they even had them there :)  "

we had a family meal in this restaurant and staff went out of their way to make the evening a memorable one! the kids food was tailored to their likings and they even got dishes that were not on the menu. advice on wine was excellent as these wines were amongst the nicest weve ever had! will definitely return here!!!
"we are americans living in beek for a couple of years and we kept hearing that we should check out this restaurant. so i booked a table for 10 for my birthday in july and it was fantastic! great italian food, great wine and slightly pricey but totally worth it. there are not too many restaurants i have liked in the nl so this is pretty high praise from me ;). its great for a romantic evening or a special occasion and we had great service (also rare!). we hope to go back! (i wish i would have taken more pictures!)"
we have been visiting pasta e vino frequently for over 20 years . only the fact that we still look out for a next occassion is enough to make it our favorite italian in the southern netherlan

this italian restaurant was recommended by our b&b hostess. we immediately noticed it was extremely busy however there simply were not enough wait staff to adequately serve all the tables. wait time for our soup and main course was quite long. my sister ordered her beef medium rare and came almost well done. my risotto was not fully cooked. the arborio rice was still crunchy. the flavor however was really good. the tiramisu was exceptional.
easy accessible. lovely food.  good service  friendly staff. would recommend to pre book as it‚Äôs a very busy place.
"the food was really good, we had the 4-courses meal and they could change it for me because it had seafood and i dont like it, it was very nice! and the dessert was delicious! but the waiting time between courses was long, at least 45min... i recommend if you want good italian food and you are not in a hurry."
the food was fresh and excellent. there was a great selection of wines. it was outstanding meal! the waitress spoke english.
we visited this restaurant twice in one week - on both occasions fabulous food! it was great to sit outside and to soak up the summer sunshine while enjoying good food. best to book as it gets busy. service is a bit slow so make sure you are prepared to wait for your food. it is worth it in the end! it is well worth a visit when in the area.
visited this restaurant to celebrate a birthday. this was our first but definitely not last visit - we are new to the ar

"family orientated service. everything is possible, split dishes, extra portion etc. great filets mignon from the grill and a choice of sauces."
came here by coincidence. what a nice restaurant in a little village like this. i had one of the best fish soups i ever h 
great italian restaurant. been there a few times and will go again. the food is delicious and service always nice. the place is very popular so book in advance. we usually book but once we didnt and were turned away on a tuesday evening!
"first class menu, service and staff.    they will cater for a table of 2 or ive seen up to 24. all are served with the same service"
"large terrace for the warm evenings, spacious interior, nice crew. but most imprtant: the food is very good. is obvious the chefs are italian. we had the risotto with white truffles (mmm!) and scallops. very nice."
"this italian brasserie was for 18 years located in horn, a village nearby, but recently the owners moved to this previous townhall. after only 8 months they already received more than 20000 gues "
good ice cream while being a walk on a sunny day in vaals right at the dutch/german border! we love the cookie & cream.
"ijssalon italia has the best home made ice cream in the area. the place is very popular in summer, but is busy even in the winter months. ice cream, coffee, chocolate milk, mulled wine, and soups. worth a visit if you are in the area!"
the restaurant is best known for its ice cream. there is a great selection of flavours and all delicio 
perfect place for a home made ice cream. we had the coupe krokant and it was excellent.  service is friendly.
nice ice cream shop with great icecream.  . enormous choice and quick service. neat interior but classy. just before bordercrossing to germany. many germans but also many locals. always busy. recommended.
"dropped in without reservation with no problems. its cost and with good service. not expensive at all, 100‚Ç¨ for 3 adults and 3 teenagers with mains and dessert. also has a nice outside terrace."
good food with nice atmosphere. friendly people. had a great evening. we ate pizza pasta and had good house wine.
"as others have said, we were not expecting to enjoy such a good meal in this lovely garden, from the outside it might deceive you but once youre in, its definitely worth it. the pizza i ordered was one of the best ive had in the netherlands and my family was also very satisfied with their choices."
nice food and top class service. definitely not expensive. i highly recommend this restaurant. they helped us with everything with a smile.
we didnt expect to find such a delightful garden to enjoy our pizza in! this was the best pizza we have ever eaten! service was also tops! we hoped to eat once more there but it is closed on a monday :(
great food good presentation attention to detail lovely service value for money i would definitely go here again to eat
"i enjoy every time when we go to this italian restaurant. there not many tables in the main restaurant, so reservation is recommended. it is an italian restaurant they serve what you normally get in a pizzaria, but what you get is very good. the atmosphere is nice and cosy. you will not be dsiappointed."
"we had √† great dinner again. the restaurant is run by 2 brothers.  try the special house cocktail, the viola. the mixend salad is fantastic. the pizza is fabulous. very friendly service.."
"vaals is a small town in the south of the netherlands, but they offer a few very nice restaurants. we went to this place nearby our hotel after we made a reservation based on some very good revie "
"we had dinner here and the food and service are amazing. food is delicious and fresh, generous portion too. we had dinner at the little courtyard at the back, beautiful!"
"excellent pizza and salads , good service , clean , nice decoration , friendly waiter and the prices are fair . i can only recommend it if you stay in vaals or nearby"
"i enjoyed a very nice pizza at della mamma. the service is personable and very friendly. the tiramisu was really tasty too. for non pretentious and nice tasting italian food, della mamma is the place"
arrived late as the restaurant was preparing to close. we were welcomed in and enjoyed a lovely meal. 2 pizzas - huge and tasty! and i had the delicious trio of lasagnes. warm and cosy on a freezing evening. house wine good - and whole bill so reasonably priced. highly recommended if you are in the area - hope to go back again before we leave.
"for starters, do not miss the chance to go here. we had a marvelous evening due to the impressive meal and the excellent wine pairings but that is not all. it was clear from the start that i was not in the driving seat here. just sit, relax and enjoy the show. this is a place that revels italian cooking and viniculture and that is where this place excels. the owner loves his wines and knows them and that shows. it is great to see someone passionate about wines, his place and cooking. this is a mom-pop business , and currently they may / can serve 10 people on a given evening. there is one menu with paired wines, i haven‚Äôt seen the winelist (remember not in the driving seat) but trust that there ample of choices. could not agree more with an earlier ta review ‚Äúdining here is not a meal, its an event.‚Äù"
"this is one of the best resto‚Äôs in the southern part of limburg. chef monique and dario start with a friendly and personal reception. we had the round table. nice! then the surprises follow each other in a nice order. food is delicious, starting with the olive variations. super! the wineselection by dario for every course makes everything top! the wildboar was superb. and the predessert and dessert show the magnificent culinary arts of chef moniqu "
this was my 3rd visit and again schatull impressed  
the taste of the different plates where always good and sometimes surprising.  we were warmly welcomed by the owner/waiter.  at the end of the evening the women received a rose to take home.  recommended but be sure you have enough time.
"we had a great evening at schatull. the food was excellent, as were the wines. there was an abundance of starters, each as nice as the other. very clear the cook loves food and likes to share. the restaurant itself is quite small (which we tend to like) so plenty attention from staff. we will definitely come again."
third visit and again a fun experience. no idea what was said by the owner but we let the food speak for itself. go and enjoy.
i was a positive surprise to find a restaurant serving this high standards in va 
was a little surprised on a bank holiday weekend there were only a few tables taken. i have no idea why as the food is excellent and the service too. you really need to speak italian or dutch although a little english is spoken too. time and effort has been taken here to prepare the food and you know it when you taste it. presentation is pure entertainment
finally we went to schatull. it was my husbands birthday so we went on a thursday. there was 1 other table of 2 and a group of appr. 15 people. everything from start to finish was great. the food was delicious and the wines really complimented the food. we would recommend this place to everybody who really enjoys going out for dinner and be a bit spoile 
its becoming a tradition to dine im schatull at the start or end of our summer holida 
we had a 5 course surprise dinner with wine arrangement. at first we got several tastefull appetizers. and then started the great 5 course italian adventure. every dish was a picture and tasted delicious. the accompanied wines also were great. it was almost as if we were in italy. we will certainly go back there soon!
"this restaurant serves real italian food. de cook is dutch, her husband is from florence and kwos a lot about great italian wines. a good combination!"
"our family spent 5 nights at the kasteel bloemendhal hotel and we were so appalled at the service by the restaurant and staff that we decided to dine in this italian restaurant across the road from the hotel........the dining experience and food was so good we went there twice more.......the owners thea and sjaak are the owners and wilma is the server and each one greets you with a beaming smile and a real sense of friendliness that the restaurant staff in the hotel are somewhat lacking. we have tried three different choices from the menu and each time the food has been superb. each meal is freshly prepared and so tasty and piping hot that you would be hard to find better in italy .....or anywhere else actually. also the price, it is very reasonable too which is an added bonus. but what makes this establishment so good is the warm welcome and attentiveness of the staff........thank you for making our holiday that much better because we really pressed for dining options at the hotel. (a review of our stay at the hotel will be posted on the hotel so "
"we have stayed in vaals 3 nights (hotel incl. 2 dinners) and had dinner here one evening. it was quiet around 21h00 monday evening. we could sit on the terrace. later on the lady asked if we wished another table because there in the corner it was a bit less windy. very kind. food was very good. we had al forno dishes. for me it was very nice but too much. so, you can ask a smaller portion, the owner told me. a nice and good suggestion. i dont if we would return to vaals or neighbourhood, but if we should, we would return to bellissima !"
casual italian with really good food. the people that work there are super friendly. i had the lasagna it was really good and i would come back here again.
"nice restaurant, very clean and light , delicious food , very good service. they have everything on the menu you expect in a pizzeria and a nice choice of wine ."
ate here one evening whilst on holiday and we were really impressed with everything about this restaurant. the pizzas and lasagne were amazing and the staff really friendly. although it was very quiet it has a lovely atmosphere and was decorated really well with beautiful lighting. would definitely recommend a visit.
"found on google maps whilst staying in a nearby hotel. what a find. extensive menu, much more than pizza and pasta. my curried chicken was amazing. husband had chicken skewers, so tender. being a rural area we struggled with language spoken and written menu but the staff were super helpful. massive portions and good value "
"before we moved, we ate here regularly and every time we are in the area again and can sit on the terrace, we like to repeat it. in fact, dogs are not allowed in the restaurant but are allowed on the terrace. and since we always travel with our little dogs, this is important to us. our last visit had apparently been a while ago because, to our pleasant surprise, the terrace had been refurbished and fitted with cosy elements. it all looked many times cozier and definitely contributes very positively to the whole dining experience. the food was delicious. i always find the carpaccio a bit watery and the addition of iceberg lettuce is mi unnecessary but my romaine skewer was delectable. the meat was perfectly grilled and the gorgonzola sauce will always be a favourite. the pasta always has an aftertaste that i am not a fan of. probably traced back to the spice mix used or perhaps the broth in which the pasta was cooked. no idea; the chef wont say and thats fine. just no more pasta for me. our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful. kudos to her for that. next time when we are in the area (and can sit outside) we would love to come again for dinner!"
"we dined here with 10 members of my dutch family and my english husband recently. the restaurant is not large but has a warm ambience and staff are very welcoming. my husband was given an english menu. we had the mixed grill which consisted of tenderloin, prime rib and fillet steak served with salad, fried or chipped potatoes with a choice of sauces and it was delicious. for afters we had dame blanche and tiramisu. everyone had different meals but were equally enthusiastic about quality and quantity and prices. definitely worth repeati "
"this restaurant is the only italian in heelsum. it has delicious pizzas (also vegetarian ones!). i have not tried yet other type of food here. they have now a terrase, which makes it more interesting especially in the summer mont "
"mostly very busy, but they do find space to seat you. especially since they have expanded. the food is honest and good value for money. the service is friendly and fast. we always enjoy this place as a quick alternative for a home cooked meal."
for italian food in a small village with almost no restaurants this a really decent italian place where they use fresh ingredients to prepare you pizza in a good oven.
"when my friend went in to make a reservation i figured id been there before and yes, that appeared to be the case. this time we sat inside and were met by a very friendly young man. the menu was varied and the prices very decent. the dishes we ordered were delicious and well presented. the place has a warm and relaxed atmosphere and nothing seems to be too much trouble. i would go back there - yet again :-) - wthout hesitation."
"we had already eaten in another village, but on the way back to our hotel we stopped at op de brink for some late-night desser "
"stepped onto the terrace late on a warm september evening looking for something to eat. though the kitchen was about to close it wasnt any trouble serving us the meal we liked to order. and there was plenty of it and very tasteful, accompanied by a very nice glass of wine. owner/manager was very friendly and pleasant, prices were very decent and we didnt have to go to bed on an empty stomach :-)"
went here for a birthday meal. little more expensive then the usual italian but they justify it by providing elevated italian dishes. the selection of 5 italian appetizers is especially great.
"the food was very delicious but it took a long time before it came, but it is definitely recommended"
food was delicious and although some reviews said service was slow (and it is a bit slow) it was definitely worth the wait. will definitely come back
"nice terrace, cozy inside with a couple of bigger tables. next to the obligatory pizzas theres also a lot of other choices. also a vast choices of wines."
"to start of with the positive, the food and athmospere are very good. they claim to be ‚Äúnot the average italian‚Äù and live up to that promi "
"been there with family and friends, excellent italian food, excellent service, even they were about to close they serviced us superbly and patiently. great gluten free pizza and pasta"
"a beautiful 1st day of august 2018. with two highly experienced and knowledgable food critics we challenged the asian executive chef to surprise us with the finest he has on the menu in italian dining. starting with a unique amuse in the form of an √≠ced drink consisting of clear tomato- and watermelon juice spiced with dash of red pepper and served in a stemless cocktail glass on a bed of crushed ice. an excellent refreshing start for lunch on a very hot day. next a smashing presentation of excellently prepared coquilles, served on a mirror of turnip cabbage puree, accompanied by crispy cauliflower flowers, slowly cooked leg of octopus and a finishing touch of lobster bisque froth. the main course a lovely variant of the classic tournedos rossini, mini-filet mignon with an excellent cuisson of duck foie-gras, sliced summer truffel, on a very tasty polenta crust & green asparagus and accompanied with a marvellously flavoured reduction of jus-de-veau, madeira wine and truffled with il mondo del tartufo white winter truffle butter. the apotheoses a composition of lemon sherbet, marinated/lightly sauted pineapple, crumbs, a friable of pineapple and the sauce of the marinade. all dishes accompanied by fabulous selected wines. from the local prosecco till the very fine italian white and red wines and a marvellous desert wine. an exceptional culinair/gastronomic experience. thank you albert/jimmy and your disciplined crew. we will certainly will be back again."
we had lunch with albertos. it is a rather new sqare with old looking buidlings. we had lunc on the terrace. it is a pleasnt view. we had a bread lunch with some drinks. it al tasted very good and fresh.the service was pleasant. prices are usual. good experience at albertos
we arrived early and spend some time in the winebar for a couple of drinks. nice place to sit and relax. got some reading done. later we moved to the restaurant. it was quite busy but the service was nice and we had a little time for a chat. the food looked great and tastes likewise.
my sister in law invited me for brunch and we went here she was telling me that the food is great and she was right! i ordered warme panini called pollo and it was very good. would love to comeback!
since the holiday came to an end we went for diner to albertos in nijkerk. we arrived just after 21.00h and that was no problem at all. for nijkerk this time for dining is pretty late but we felt very welcome and the evening had not at all come to an en 
"good restaurant, wide choice, from pizzas to ossobucco. very friendly service, bit of a limited wine list (3 each of white/rose/red). maybe the win bar inside has more to offer? my secreto iberico was really good, pork with clobbered potatoes (translated from dutch)."
"not your standard italian restaurant. nice variety in dishes, they even have pizzas. friendly service, sometimes a bit hectic. the combination with the wine bar works well."
"best italian in the area - superb of food, cool ambience & friendly staffs. what more one would need for an afternoon out!!"
this is a refreshing addition to the restaurant options in nijkerk. it has a laid back atmosphere and the food is good. would definitely recommend.
nice cosy place for easy snack food. not the nicest atmosphere due to high amount of people coming in and out for takeout in the adjoining snackbar.
"bellini‚Äôs pizza and pasta is a decent formula italian located at strand horst, exit 11 of the a28 on the northbound route. great opportunity for a fairly quick meal with better quality than at the neighbouring golden arches. on tuesday they have pizza night, and on wednesday pasta night - all menu items for 10 euros. big helpings. not bad! "
"we came with the kids, got a place on the balcony next to the water (amazing vie "
"the best pizza we had outside italy. service is great also. aparently the place has a very good reputation as most of the tabes were occupied. a starter and a pizza was a little bit too much as the pizzas are very big sied. a real recommendation , perhaps next time we will try some pasta."
the bistecca della casa for many years my number one drive 25 km extra for hospitality wonderful for many years
we had great first dishes also fresh oyster.  we had an excellent red italian wine.  the team was super friendly patient and warm. really recommended
"the atmosphere in the restaurant is nove. the service is fine and very quick. we had pizzas and they were delicious. and, not unimportment, the prices are fine."
"a most pleasant, informal restaurant where the owner participates in the kitchen and checks the meals before they are served. as a result, the quality is excellent and consistent. we can especially recommend that visitors try the fish dishes, which are expertly cooked. we have been regular guests for some years now and certainly will remain so!"
"the food is to die for! great taste and large portions. staff is friendly-ish. some go out of their way, others are a bit cool (no smiles "
"this restaurant never disappoints me. every time the food is great. it does not matter if you order pasta, pizza, fish or meat: everything is fresh and has a great flavo "
"the restaurant has been in ermelo for years and it keeps being the best italian restaurant in the area. they do take aways, but please take the time to go inside, order some authentic italian food, enjoy the fixing in the open kitchen and enjoy your diner. the service is good. young people, but they know what they talk about at your table, instead of telling a line and being nervous when asked a question. pizzas are good, and so are the other dishes on the menu. especially the tagliata a manzo. authentic italian and with your eyes closed, you dream away...enjoying."
"real good food. one advice, reserve in advance, because its almost full everyday, except for monday ( closing day ). you can see the chefs being busy in the kitchen,  "
restaurant with a spacious sunny terras in a tiny village. if you are craving for a good burger i couldnt recommend this place highly enoug 
gorgeous location along a waterway overlooking a small bridg 
we have been checking for restaurants in the area of emmeloord or urk and found da enzo in emmeloord. very nice service and great food. amazing foccacia and pasta. we will come back next time!
we were to feel really welcome when we arrived at the restaurant. we noticed that the restaurant was busy and had a pleasant atmosphere. everyone in our group of six ordered different things and everything was beautifully cooked and well presented. thank you for our lovely evening. 
"had a great tapas meals with my dad and auntie. we were a bit squished in, but it was very busy so forgivable. the staff were brilliant and very helpful with everything. i would definitely go back!"
"we loved the family character of this restaurant and the food that was on the menu. the risotto was yummy, but of course you can also get lots of different pizzas here!"
very nice and cosy place. good size portions. tasty food. polite service. will definitely come back again.
this italian restaurant is in this area the best place to be. nice food and good quality. very friendly people.
went here for a large group dinner and experienced a very nice evening with good italian food served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. would happily go again either for business or for social dinner as it had a nice authentic feel and everyone enjoyed their meals.
"my wife and i have visited da enzo several times 5 years ago and this year while on holidays in the netherlands and we love the food, really enjoyed it. the staff might sometimes be a bit inexperienced but they are friendly and should maybe get a bit more education on wine , red wine is not in the fridge, but this happens a lot in australia too , some waiters with a hospitality diploma do not know the difference between red and white wine, something about lack in education from ( private?) courses?anyway a lot of hospitality workers are doing their best and are friendly and helpful, the ones that are not interested in hospitality should reconsider their profession. "
"with local friends to the very popular italian here. midweek and busy and good ambience in well appointed restaurant which previously was a simple pizzaria. extensive typical italian menu and huge list of pizza. my seasonal special of a pork rib with mushrooms was delightful with a side veg plate and salad. others had tortellini (rather gigantic), risotto with beef was ok and a saltimbocca ok but the veal was a little tough. small italian wine list of reasonable quality. an enjoyable evening at good price and a friendly italian host."
"always a pleasure to eat here especially when the owner starts his solo mio. a friendly, unhurried atmosphere with attention to service and food. reservation recommended"
"good combination in food, value, quality & atmosphere. during the weekend make sure to make a reservation in time."
randomly came across this place after a series of coincidences. i am so glad we d 
"my friend invited me to go here for dinner. both of us order pasta, which are really good. we come here year ago, we feel it is maybe the best italian  restaurant here."
"very nice authentic italian restaurant. cosy feeling, good atmosphere. food was prepared fast and everything was on point. we had pizzas and the dough is prepared with biologic flour from italy, raised over 24h and you can feel it! ingredients are from italy and all comes together perfectly. i can really recommend this place for a good italian pizza (nothing like the fastfood chains nowadays). i have noticed that the pizza was rich in flavor, but not oily, like it often is in other places. no heavy feeling afterwards :)"
"fine restaurant, good quality food, all fresh and handmade. the pizza and the pasta were really good, what you would expect for these kind of price "
"super friendly staff, quick preparation, and yummy toppings.  they do delivery, takeaway, and (as we did) shared tables or window seats.  reasonable prices as well."
"we visited this restaurant twice within a stay of 3 days for dinner. the pizza is really nice and it almost feels like you‚Äôre in italy. the portions are big ! also, the place offers ice cream, which is really nice for a refreshments."
"certainly on a sunday night, this place was doing most of its business by telephone/delivery, but has a several eat-in tables right by the window overlooking the canal. the food was simple but plentiful and very tasty - and very reasonably priced. its nothing fancy but definitely a very pleasant place to eat in a nice location."
"great pizza take away, especially like bari, pesto en vulcano. rather quick delivery and still warm,"
best pizza in abcoude. not many places to eat in so its best to take out. its always busy there so better call in advance. they also deliver in the neighborhood.
"this is one i specifically asked tripadvisor to add, as it was an impressive enough meal to make note of. youll find porta e porta less than one block from the church in the main town square, and its pizza, salads, and even its desserts are worth tasting. excellent choice for inexpensive, good italian (at least dutch-style italian)."
"on the main street of hillegom , good authentic italian food, with excellent service. over the years i have dined here on a number of occasions it‚Äôs nothing special yet at the same time it‚Äôs a perfect place to eat when on holiday or working in the area . serves good food with excellent service nothing more."
dined here recently on a trip to visit friends in hillegom.  the staff were very friendly and the food was very good.  prices were reasonable too.  will definitely visit again on my next trip to hillegom.
"although located in a small dutch city this is a very good italian cuisine restaurant. the menu is quite rich, with dishes suited for all tastes. the wine is also good and not so pricy. and to complete everything the service is very customer oriented."
"roma antica is located at the far end of the main street in hook of holland. it is a typical neighbourhood italian restaurant which seems to have a loyal customer base and friendly atmosphere. the menu is a standard italian with pastas, meat dishes and pizzas. there were 3 of us and we had spaghetti bolognese, veal in a lemon sauce and a pizza margharita. all were very good. if you are looking for a place to eat before the ferry this fits the bill."
"great food and service, if you are in hoek van holland then this is a recommended restaurant. please note open from 17:00 - 22:00 but not monday."
"hotel and conference centre blooming has a perfect restaurant indicated as zndhv meaning zandhoeve (i.e sand homestead) . my wife told me that it is new, with a new chef. we had dinner here and it was perfect. flexible, friendly and helpful staff, good choice of drinks and a perfect, well created menu, also for vegetarians. we enjoyed zndhv, indeed. fair prices too."
if you are in bergen you need to check out this restaurant for it‚Äôs lovely italian food. you might even bump into a famous az football player. the staff are ready to help with you your order and also really engage with their guest. as for the food it was delicious and i can‚Äôt wait to visit again soon.
authentic italian food. a lot more than just pizza.. which is excellent by the way. nice staff. all good.
"you are right in the center of bergen. its fun to watch passers by. enormous windows let the sun shine through, the service is correct, the food has a touch of italian, pizza and pasta in the foreground. all in all, not very different than the other three or four places in the same location: nero, wonders, loetje. ..one comes here more for the pleasure of watching and beeing watched than for the gastronomic experience."
"i had amazing pizza, very simple and delicious, with adding a little bit of green to it, absolutely amazing and the staff very friendly and and seating area is beautiful and the restaurant located in the middle of the little town."
the pizza was very good and the service aswell. 15 norwegians was all happy. nice prices also! one problem to pay seperatly !
we descended on this place on a friday evening and found a table towards the back of the restaurant. managing a high chair for the 2 year old and a place for our dog and the large pram was done with minimum effor 
"pleasant place with a really good pizza, you can sit in the glassed-over part, but it gets very noisy when it rains - rather amusing if you dont mind."
"have had pizzas at this terrace restaurant at both lunch and dinner time, they offer take-away if you dont fancy eating in, i would recommend you did though. great prompt staff. friendly family atmosphere. nice wine and great tasting pizza. on this occasion i had the capriciossa pizza and shared a half carraf of house red. the two blended perfectly and the price was spot on. i was more than happy to leave a 10% tip. given how busy they were and how well they managed to get the food and drinks out and keep everyone happy. its located on the strip of restaurants and cafes in bergen. a quaint village feel and although i was quite casually dressed the vibe made me feel comfortable and welcomed. the space inside the restaurant is large and has a nice italian feel with column fixtures and a big traditional pizza oven. very impressed indeed "
"la terrazza is a very nice place, with great ambiance. service was excelent, and food superberb.  absolutely worth going for a nice meal.  only minus was that all doors on the terazza was open, and that smokers was allowed at tables outside smoking."
"i really love this place! the staff is really really friendly. the food was very good and we didnt have to wait long. the choices on the menu are very different, good! we highly recommended this place if you are around."
this is an italian restaurant in the same way that clogs and windmills are an experience of holland. it has all the pastas and pizzas you would expect and of a good quality but also nothing beyond that. the price is on the high side but the friendly staff and large portions make up for a lot.
"this is a classic italian restaurant with quite a number of choices on the menu. the service is very attentive, though a bit slow. it may have been the lunch peak when the kitchen was the bottleneck. they give a good value and i would definitely visit again when in bergen. "
"great for family fun or to have a romantic dinner. we went for lunch and had a table for 11, which wasnt a problem. the food was great!! cute little town too :)."
"actually, as a regular visitor i have been recommending this place to people i socialize with for as long as i live here. you see, it really feels like a privilege to live within walking distance of a good italian restaurant. at montagne, even your pizza quattro frommaggi or your pasta bolognese is beyond reproach. if you are a visitor from italy, youll probably be able to determine the region the cook is coming from by the way he prepares a side dish of zucchini that you wont find on the menu but that would make his mother cry out with delight."
"cozy place and friendly staff. good quality and you will need a good appetite! nice menu, good price. but where is the soup? staff told us they really dont sell soup..."
"ok, if you are looking for excellent food in a really nice setting, look no further than la cucina. we were lucky to find this place and had a wonderful meal, fantastic service and all set in a lovely garden."
very nice and well setup restaurant with one part of it being in the yard . i only had dinner 3 times but inside. i found their food to be of high quality after trying the pizza and pasta from menu.
we have visited hoogerheide five times for cyclocross and have walked past the restaurant many times. this time we decided we should eat here. the restaurant was busy and the earliest we could eat was about two hours later so table booked we went into town for drink 
"good food at the local italian restaurant in hoogerheide. the grilled octopus as a starter was great, the carpacio to. the pasta vongole is good but a little to sharp and pizza with grilled vegetables was very tasty. good place!"
"its a good italian restaurant, the food was delicious. the real italian taste. the carpaccio was  amazing, just simple with no other competitive flavors like rucola and cheese . the carpaccio was like it should be, all about the meat! üòÉüëçüèº"
"la cucina italian restaurant in hoogerheide netherlands close to the belgium border was a great surprise. the service was very friendly, the open kitchen concept behind a glass wall was unique and the food was of course delicious. everyone in our party ordered different selections of meals from seafood pasta, lasagna, ossobuco to steak dinner for two persons which i shared called costata di manzo alla brac "
"sofar we have dined several times in la cucina, surely a place to come back to! good hospitality, great food!"
"we visted the restaurant on a weekday in january, whereby the open fire gave a comfortable atmophe "
"we have visited la cucina repeatedly over a 10+ years period. their menu has (always had) great variety. this is also an italian where you can buy superb pizza of course, but their true quality gets revealed when selecting fish, meat, pasta, or their specials outside the menu. nice atmosphere, quiet outside dining is possible on a small court during summ "
"i never write reviews but feel that the proprietors really deserve praise. a well oiled machine with a simple menu. i appreciate what other review said about the cuisine being basic, and as a family of vegetarians we were preparing for the worst. but every lovely staff member went out of their way to translate for us and accommodate our needs. pizzas were think based and delicious (dont expect exotic, you wouldnt get it in italy either), pasta well presented and deserts were authentically italian - id go so far to say as the best tiramisu i have had in years! most importantly the atmosphere was lovely and our little one was treated to a special present when we left. cant recommend the simple but warming restaurant enough. takeaway also available."
"pizza is very tasty, but a little bit expensive (~15‚Ç¨). over this there is no real vegetarian pizza, you can pick between margarita, mushrooms or pesto/mozzarella.  the staff is young and very friendly, the ambiente is wonderful."
because i have an issue with dairy fat and they did not blink an eyelid and told me that would do a meal for me.  very good service and very busy so it good
"we walked in to divino on an uncomfortable night; but they had awesome food, good drinks and the best service. we still talk about it after visiting 4 other michelin restaurants.  just make yourselves at home and let it happen."
always love it to come here. food is amazing and the staff and hospitality is always on point . is amplified you can take everyone .
we had lunch and it exceeded our expectations both in food and service ! people care ‚Ä¶ place is very clean we will be back !
with eastern we had an excellent lunch with the whole family peters. on a sunny day there was reserved al great long table on the terras. we orderd ala cart en each choise was very tasty and excellent. the wines we chose were also very good
"we found this a very interesting and intriguing concept. italian cooking with a fusion twist. different than what you would expect from italian cuisine, this restaurant combines with surprising results and flavors. dishes look like pieces of art. very different from pizza or pasta. autumn ingredients, were combined, with italian traditio "
"the first impression from outside was inside totally confirmed: very friendly service, fine meals (good choice) and the appropriate wines per glas, so that you could try several tastes of wine. we had a very nice dinner evening and we enjoyed from the beginning with apero snacks to the end (good espresso with cantucci and vin santo) and the main courses were delicious and beautiful served. prima!!"
"we have been here for three times already and will return many times. superb meals and fitting wines, great staff who take time to inform you - and they are informed well ! - about the food and the wines. great open kitchen on which you can look at the staff preparing everything in a quick and relaxed mode."
"tried out this restaurant/ bistro and was pleasantly surprised about the menu, wine list and especially the service. staff know their food as well as their wines and are very service oriented. tried the de luxe tapa meat platter which was fantastic. the dinner party enjoyed the scallops with bisque foam sauce, and the latter one showed up on the ravioli as well. the bavete looked small in size but this was compensated by its tenderness and taste. highly commended. "
"in case youre in the neighborhood of eindhoven, this restaurant is for sure worth a detour. the restaurant has a very nice interior with an open kitchen; also nice outdoor seating and even a small playground for children. the menu has simply too many great options to choose from and the service was outstanding. our waitress had an good knowledge about the wine list and you dont see that too often."
"we went away for a quiet weekend, and the guesthouse recommended this restaurant. as it was a sleepy village we did not expect much but we were pleasantly surprised. firstly service is not always good in the netherlands, however this place was as good as anywhere in paris or uk. very attentive staff, friendly, quick and well presented. secondly the terrace is great on a sunny day, we sat outside if a very comfy snug... was just perfect. thirdly the food was a great selection of seasonal food and very tasty and relitiviely cheap for what you got (in fact we came back for lunch the next day!). one small criticism was that the vegetarian selection for my girlfriend was a little limited. and finally the drink selection of wines was amazing, and the coffee was the best i have drunk in the netherlands... was almost as good as in italy"
"visited for a saturday evening meal with our oldest son. excellent service, atmosphere and meal. we had the surprise menu divino and we were done for +/- ‚Ç¨54.00 pp including drinks. unobtrusive, efficient and friendly service.  a real discovery. well be back."
"we went for lunch and wanted to the wine selection. bottles start at 20‚Ç¨ and the sky is the limit. we were very happy with the kerner. main dishes are around 15‚Ç¨, and everbody from our group of 8 was en joy ing it. friendly employes also contributed to a great stay at this pl "
"every option was absolutely fresh and tasty, especially prawns and salmon were the best. staffs were great, very nice location/ decoration. in short was a great experience."
good choice and quality comfortable with good service and friendly at loopuitpark julianadorp easy to park
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è in my book all day long!    thanx for a beautiful evening üòä all the food was great and even got a little present at desert üëç
the team (chef and service) is very friendly and always try to get you a table when you have no reservati 
the restaurant was able to accommodate a table for 10 without booking. the menu is incredibly extensive making it hard to choose. the pizzas were huge with very generous toppings which does make the base a little soggy in the middle. the wine wasn‚Äôt the best. we thought we had ordered red but it looked more rose! 
i enjoyed this place! really nice pizza and stuff!! you feel that you really eat an italian pizza!! recomend it for sure!!!!
"we were a group of nine people and everybody was happy with the food. we got a nice table outside and the service was friendly. please note however that there is no english menu, as most foreign tourists tend to be german. there was a fussball table outside which entertained the kids while we waited for the food. all in all a good experience. we went twice while we stayed in the area. make sure to book a table in advance - it is expected, although they forgave us for not knowing the first time. :)"
"usually go for the pizza, however the other dishes are nice as well. sometimes it is quite busy and noisy, in summer you can sit outside. parking is free and available."
"service was friendly, pizza was good and all this for a price that was unmatched by nearby restaurants."
we ate at one restaurant on site at center parc port z√©lande ‚Äì nonna‚Äôs on our last night. the food was quite good ‚Äì the majority of us had pizza and they were very accommodating for the five vegans among our group of nine! the waitstaff even broke out into a dance and all the kids in our group joined i 
we have spent sometime in andijk but had never tried this establishment what a great mistake that w 
the location and the view are really beautiful. the waitress was so helpful. we enjoyed the food so much.
we stopped for coffee and were given fabulous friendly welcome and service - beyond anything you should expect.  the coffee came quickly and was very good.  lovely location on the dyke with beautiful views.  excellent.  cannot recommend highly-enough
"we came here in may for dinner. lovely ambience, super service! they are sticking to a small menu, therefore products are fresh and divine. a place where locals meet."
lovely hotel bar and restaurant in a beautiful setting by the creek or what ever they call it in holland. english speaking of course. english and dutch menus. huge rooms. great breakfast included and really great dinners. plenty of parking off road. highly recommended and run and owned by a local family. 
"service is very friendly, food is great, timing is perfect. a family ran restaurant which is really focused on their customers and with a good menu selection. i will for sure return!"
"our last night in uden and this restaurant was recommended to us. we both had pasta dishes. my husband the spaghetti bolognese and i had pasta filled with spinach and ricotta. mine needed a little more salt and more ricotta because the spinach really over powered the dish but my husband said that his was the best he ever had. we then had tiramisu and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce which both were very good! the atmosphere is very nice and romantic, but good for families as well! i love the fact that they had a diaper changing table in the bathroom because a lot of the restaurants near our hotel do not. would definitely recommend for good italian food!"
"this restaurant in uden is one of my favorite restaurants in uden. the taste of the food is excellent and a lot of choice. furthermore the staff is always friendly and i always feel welcome. the interior is modern, not very traditional. the restaurant is quite big but most of the time it is advisable to order a table. the prices are not budget, but the quality is good. there are choices for vegetarian, but more is always welcome. the only thing i miss in the interior is the traditional italian feeling.. it is quite modern."
"we had a 3 course menu. turned out to be an excellent choice! as starter we had 5 different amuses. main course was a pasta or a pizza. dessert was a plate with 5 different sweet snacks. all for the very democratic price of 19,95‚Ç¨!"
"pretty good. ive been here a few times now, and its a solid italian restaurant. very freindly service."
we had really good pizza and pasta here on tuesday night along with some beers. friendly small restaurant although we were the only people there on this night. very helpful waiter and chef. food was all freshly cooked and ingredients were fresh. prices are good too. definitely recommend for hungry cyclists like us.
"went there for dinner about 3 times, the service is quite friendly, the restaurante is clean and pleasing ambience. food quality is goog, the pizza recipes are not the best, but still good ingredients and tasty food.  good for every dinner."
very fun italian food.  great pizza and the prices were reasonable.  i would definitely recommend it.  located near the large church.
"this was a random find as we were trying to find anything open on a tuesday night (the greek spot is open, though i dont recommend it... "
this restaurant offers nice food & service with an italian bite. pricing is average /higher than a take-away pizza restaurant. you can have some problems parking your car. reservations not necessary.
"im living in italy for more than 10 years and usually dont eat pasta when i go out of country, but in this restaurant, call my attention the colours and the good taste with which it has been decorated, surprise me the love and dedication that the owners have for work on it, smiling and attentive to more minimum detail, so enthusiastic for the good energy in this place i decided eat penne di nonna and surprise was delicious!!!"
the place offers a great variety of ice cream flavours..some of them really unusual but tasty. we took also a cappuccino and it was very good.
the coffee is good and they have a great selection of ice-cream for very reasonable price  the coffee also came with a small mini ice-cream and syrup which was nice and cute.
nice selection of ice creams - refreshing after walking around the interesting locality of baarle-nassau and baarle-hertog with its many border crossings between the netherlands and belgium.
very delicious ice cream served by very friendly staff. no more no less just good! i took the vanilla and mocca with a touch of cream. i also taste the coconut and citrus.   mix some flavors and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
"la pergola is the only authentic italian restaurant in baarle-nassau. located on the chaamseweg, this is where to go if you want a tasty italian pizza. dont be mistaken by the cheap takeaway across the street. la pergola sits hidden in the back of a driveway, right behind a french restauran "
"they serve pizza, and they serve it good! about 8 pizzas on the menu, all delicious with a little twist."
"on a business trip my hosts suggested an  italian  restaurant. from the outside looks inviting. on entering into the main restaurant one can immediately see it really,  fine dining , italian style. re inforced, when asking for a gin and tonic, to be presented with a small bound card with no less than 8, g+t options ( italian gin). the food was also as exciting, with the nice feature of a small gift starter from the kitchen. the staff were also very friendly and professional. a place to go again."
after stroking a few sheeps in dutch highlands we decided to arrange a dinner at adriano and it was a blas 
"this was a real treat. the food was delicious (we had the 4 course surprise menu), the service was lovely and the decor was great, too. such an enjoyable night!"
nice location and authentic italian (no pizza!). good food and good service. place cares for a refurbishing though and price vs quality i found it overpriced (not michelin star but prices are). pretends to be very posh but sometimes too informal. very good and robust choice but it could be better...
"always love to come to restaurants where real italians cook! this one is according to my favorite tastes: sapori italiani. they also prepare for you what is not on the menu, like anti-pasti. they make what they have available, delightful. atmosphere is cosy and intimate (didnt overhear our neighbors talking e.g.), service is personal and swift. food was delicious to me, and i am not complaining about the prices. it was a treat, all the way! love to come again. please adriano, stay on!"
"as a guest, we were unsure of our destination other than itali "
by fabrizio was the nearest restaurant to our hotel on sunday evening and we booked a tab 
we discovered this wonderful restaurant on our drive from weert to our hotel in hee 
"it has been a long time ago that we have eaten such great italian dishes. great food,friendly service and nice location. warm and inviting! compliments!!"
"hidden behind a bit inconspicuous facade lies a very good restaurant where chef massimo and tonie serve the greatest pastas, pizzas, meat or fish dishes and exquisite desser "
if i could use one word for this review it would be excellent! you wouldnt expect such top quality food when passing this facade .. it was not cheap..but that was our choice.
"lovely friendley small italian resteraunt, we had the chicken pizza unbelievable so much fresh vegetables and so much chicken breast,love the atmosphere there we will be back"
"i have twice recently had the pleasure of eating at la fortuna restaurant in heeze, the food was excellent of both occasions, the helpings good, the service pleasant and genuine and the value overall was very good. it was very clear this restaurant uses only the best and freshest ingredients (local if possible) and has a passion for delivering his customers the best they can, a rare quality in many restaurants today. the second night i was there, it was much less crowded than my first visit and that gave me time to appreciate how good it really was. if you are anywhere near heeze or eindhoven, i could highly recommend la fortuna, especially if you like good food."
"the village of heeze,in the province of brabant (the netehrlands) is surrounded by an extended heath landscape in which it is nice to walk. but do not get lost! it has a nice castle and a lots of restaurants amongst which one with three michelin stars. we just discovered, however, a cosy, small italian restaurant just 10 metres out of the centre called la fortuna. a great choice of home made dishes, pizzas pastas and what have you, good ingredients,decent prices."
this is a locally owned little resto. in the middle of downtown limbricht.  friendly service with good food for the buck (or ‚Ç¨). wines good as well. parking around the corner.  we recommend this trattoria!
the ices were very tasty and super service provided by eleonore. the ice coffees are also very good prepared.
today we ordered pizza online and i must say that these were the best pizzas ever! here is why we say th 
"schiedam, a small city on the rotterdam fringe, overlooked by many tourists who barrel down the freeway. this city is well worth a stop and a look around, from the stedelijk , jenever,( dutch gin), and servers other museums and then the tallest windmills in the country. explore the windmill museum,take a boat tour around the city which is a real highlight. or just enjoy a drink on the stadhuis plein. a very relaxed , friendly city to explore and enjoy. something for the whole family. dont pass this city. close to the the hague , rotterdam and easily reached by public transport. explore this city, whilst some parts are still under regeneration, this is normal for any city,. a very relaxed enjoyable day. well worth the visit."
it is in principle a top wine bar and more recently they started to serve smaller meals in between tapas and a fully fledged restaurants. very cozy atmosphere. fantastic alternative if you don‚Äôt want a full meal.
"this relatively new ice cream parlor in schiedam has taken off with a good start, the ice cream is creamy and very flavorf "
i was very impressed by the italian tastes of the dishes and i think everything was delicious!the service was excellent and i surely will came back again with family and friends!!!
we had diner at al bella rose. a nice little italian trattoria. simple but excellent food. my companions had delicious pasta and i was treated with a very sovoury pizza mare nostro. very nice and friendly staff. worth visiting!!!
"had a really nice dinner here. friendly staff. very good food. my only point of feedback is that when i wanted to order the nduja pizza, staff warned me that the nduja would not be sliced sausage but a paste of this sausage. i can imagine people being disappointed with this, so i do appreciate the caution (which probably has a reason). but having the nduja sliced rather than as a paste would be my preference."
outstanding service!! we ordered a big order on-line on saturday 6/24 at noon and the order was ready for pick up by 5 
"i had the calamari as starter and it was very tasty esp. the aioli. i can also recommend the carpaccio. the highlight of my evening was the tagliatelli with mushrooms and truffels, so delicious. the portions were generous so be warned. the ambiance is very welcoming and cozy. the staff was very friendly and accomodating. be sure to visit if you crave italian food"
"in august 2017, we visited pronto! for a family dinner. choices for pizza are enormous, for fish and meat limited, but good in variety. the food itself tasted very good, well cooked and seasoned with the right herbs. overall a very good meal, also for the kids."
"an perfect place to be! original pizza`s and other food. nice about the place is the space to sit: the room is high and there is a lot of room arround your chair, you cannot hear your neighbour. also nice: there is a lot of parkingplaces outside, not uninportant!"
"the restaurant is nice, the italian chef, massimo, is a master. i had the honour to meet him before dining and i can confirm his proficiency. staff is good and girls are kind. i suggest you this place for a nice pizza or an italian dinner. "
"excellent value for money! good, fresh food for reasonable prices. friendly staff although i do recognize an earlier comment about staff asking for a reservation and then taking a long time to decide where to seat you in a clearly half-empty restaurant."
"pronto offers very good quality pizza and other food for a very reasonable price. they have regular special offers during weekdays which are even sharper priced. the atmosphere inside is very nice with a great view in the kitchen on the traditional pizza oven. i would definitely recommend to go and have dinner there with the family, or just with your partner."
we were here for the fourth time and we had a wonderfull meal again. personal is very friendly and fast and the interior of the resturant is modern and good. were going bach sometime
"excellent italian restaurant, pizza with genuine ingredients. the owners are italian and cook very well, they are very kind. the dishes are real italian, with no dutch or touristic influences!"
very good and very professional! a very good place where have a nice meal with fresh recepies in the heart of schiedam
we had a warm welcome and we had a good dinner last friday. everyone in the company enjoyed their meal. i certainly want to go back when i go back to schiedam.
we ate here a few times whilst in schiedam for a business trip. it was exactly what we were looking for - good food for a reasonable price. the service was friendly and there was a nice atmosphere outside with views on to the square.
"every guest is welcomed by the owner, a nice and friendly person, i a way that you feel at home immediatly. the dishes are all very tastefull."
"we sat down at the terrace with the sun setting, looking for a nice dinne "
"dropped in for a spot of lunch and found an amazing italian. some of the best italian food ever had, despite living in milan for 10 years. very reasonable prices, fantastic service and a real passion form the owners to serve you great food with an open armed italian welcome. will be a regular now! thanks for a lovely welcome and fantastic food. "
"ive now dined here numerous times. a very simple restaurant, more cafe like at times but located overlooking one of the nicest parts of schiedam. the menu is simple but provides a good range of pasta and pizza. the recent addition of alcohol has certainly added to the appeal with italian beers and wines now available. dining is best outside people watching the beautiful square. upstairs is not so pleasant but downstairs allows you to see the wonderful owner organise her staff. the service can be a little slow at times but is always friendly. and the food is fabulous. fantastic pizzas and pasta. proper home style cooking full of flavour and at very reasonable prices. my favourite place to eat in schiedam for a relaxed, flavourful and friendly meal. grazie mille. "
"after i left italy it was hard to find a real good italian restaurant in the netherlands. cotto e mangiato is a rare place where you can get a real italian food, great quality and fine prices."
"very recommendable italian restaurant, we had a dinner and we ordered different types of pizzas. the ingredients were very tasty and the dough well cooked! to drink, they have a variety of natural juices which are very recommendable too."
cotto en mangiato is a combination of deli and (lunch)restaurant. i have lunch here regular 
i am not a great ice cream expert but good selection of flavours ranging from silly (smurf!) to exotic fruits and usual favourites like chocolate. friendly staff made allowances for my terrible dutch
nice location opposite old town hall and next to small lift bridge and manual lock on canal.  good selection of flavours and (gluten free) sorbet.
the pizza is amazing‚Ä¶ the best pizza in netherlands. a very friendly and cozy family owned restaurant..the girl was also very good.
"we a visiting fresco already for years. the ice cream is great, especially the apple flavor in combination with the nuts on top off."
"de olifant is an italien restaurant. not the standard ones with pizza, but original italien food. we are sure we will go back one time."
"very nice restaurant. friendly staff and tasty food. as usual, i could not decide between the main courses, and the staff were flexible enough to serve a combination of two (codfish, risotto with some cheesy sauce and, i must admit, the best spinach). although im never a great fan of pronounced desserts after a savory main dish, this modest dessert certainly met my expectation."
"the first night we ate here the food was great and the service was excellent. we had a lovely meal and liked everything we were served. so, we returned the next night and we were very disappointed. we were seated in a room with a table of 8 people who had too much to drink and were very loud - when we got there! we indicated we would like to sit in another room and we were denied the change. the first half of our evening we could not even hear each other - until the party of 8 left. we were the only other group sitting in the room, so that left us alone but it was quiet. unfortunately, we were then ignored most of the evening. luckily we were leaving for another part of the netherlands the next day. not sure we would return here as it seems to be hit and miss."
on this historicall place is situated the olifant. beautiful view on the river vecht. you can eat inside or outside. we had a three course diner on the terrace in the early evening. the place was quite full. personel is friendly and professional. food is italian but no pizzas here. there is a small card with enough of choice also vegetarian. wine card leaves enough variety.all courses tasted very well and made up nicely. prices are a bit high we found but the food is good so why worry.
"comfortable, modern relaxed restaurant serving high quality food. saturday night visit so it was busy, staff very helpful and friendly."
"great service, basic food served well (the freshness and the choice of ingredients do the sell) 50th wedding anniversary also happened to be booked when i arrived which also created a lovely atmosphere. shame it was the evening as i couldnt appreciate the surroundings."
"the food was wonderful and the staff were lovely, we were given english menus and were seated quickly. there was a large selection of food on the menu and our server answered any queries we had happily. the food came quickly and was delicious, we all enjoyed our meal very muc "
"recommend for nice pizza. quick service, cook knows what hes doing. decent price. liked the choice of sweets"
this italian is located in the tiny brugstraat (bridge street) with two way traffic but one and a half street width. that street itself gives entertainment when cars come from both sides (with care and attention cars can pass). the restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere and lots of menu choices. you wont leave this place hungry and you wont leave this place broke either. they serve meat and fish dishes as well as vegetarian meals. there is also pizza and pasta. it is an italian restaurant! we would definately revisit.
"very nice restaurant with a big pizza oven that makes very tasty pizza‚Äôs. great place, i am sure i will visit it again, when i am in the neighbourhood üëåüèº"

it‚Äôs the second time i come here. once in the evening for a risotto which was cheap and excellent in a great atmosphere since there was a high quality singer that evening. today for lunch for an excellent and well-priced pizza burrata. i ordered an orange juice: generous glass of fresh juice at a very reasonable price. the place is big but very nicely decorated. not to be expected in this area. 
nice pizzeria in a shopping centrum. for lunch you can make a reservat for bigger groups.  the is good and the service friendly.

"it was lovely dinner with family here. good food, it comes in big portion. we ordered pizza and pasta. my fav is pizza margharitha."
atmosphere in the front is very nice. in the back a little bit less with too much light. food was good. bit very special but price quality it was good.
"after a busy day at the local knitting festival we visited this restaurant on the strength of the reviews and were not disappointed. the service was prompt, the atmosphere great and the pizzas were quite simply as good as we have ever experienced. we understand the chef is italian - and he clearly excels. the base is nice and thin and the toppings generous. the soup and desserts were also very tasty. its the sort of place we wish we had back home - thats how much we enjoyed  "

"made in italy is a large and modernly decorated formula italian restaurant on the edge of the bogaard shopping centre in rijswijk. service was quick and pleasant. food came very quickly despite a moderate amount of guests in the house. helpings failry sizeable. taste rather bland and a bit oily, but doable. overall a good experience for a fast meal ahead of the election debate."

"weve been here several times. with my family or with a friend and our kids. theres a great space for the kids to play (small kids tables, toys etc) so mamas can have dinner while kids are playing. we loved the pizza and the tiramisu. my friend also had ravioli with truffles and mushrooms which was excellent. and also important, very good prices and very friendly and quick service. can only recommend. "
"made in italy has only been opened for a few weeks and as it is only a few minutes walk from my house, i decided that i needed to give it a try, the restaurant has a very modern d√©cor, no straw covered chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling in this establishment and is split into a bistro area at the front, the restaurant in the middle and an area at the rear, set with a few large tables for big partie "
great dinner with real italian food.  very nice atmosphere inside. i recommend pasta with gambas and proseco
after at least one year i visited this restaurant again.  the fillet pepper steak with two sorts of was excellent.  also excellent the gratinated aubergine. the variety of starters is as usually.  the desserts are also very good. friendly staff.
"we have been to gran sasso several times and this is place where you want to return again and again. the service is excellent, the food and wines are delicious!"
fantastic experience at gran sasso. authentic food and nice people. wine offer was good and presentation of food well done.
the staff and the food is great! the food is cooked carefully and therefore it is really tasty. the prices are affordable for the dutch standards. i definetly recommend.
"when we walked away after terrible experience in a nearby restaurant , we felt very welcome in gran sasso.also the food was really tasty, and the staff is very helpful."
"if you search genuine italian food or a good pizza, this is the right place. the food is really good and the place in the center of rijswijk is cozy and warm."
"great service and wonderful italian food. we love to eat here. nice in the old centre of rijswijk. you must eat the carpaccio,"
"lovely restaurant, delicious food! the service was a little slow as the owner was training up the other two serving staff. they were able to make a dish of gluten free pasta for my mum. the layout of the restaurant was nicely laid out, though a bit cramped."
"wonderful evening with some dear friends. good service, excellent food, carpaccio fantastic. nice atmosphere, friendly staff. all food freshly prepared by people that know what they are doing. great spot for dinner in rijswijk"
the food was great and the service was excellent! we asked for vegetarian food and they went out of the way to make our lunch one of the best!
"i have been eating at gran sasso several times in the recent past and each time was an enjoyable and rewarding experience. while modestly priced, the authentic italian food is of very good quality."
visited alone on busine 
"we love to eat here. the food is fantastic, the season menus very well put together. the desserts to die for. without doubt the best restaurant in rijswijk."
"the new owner has given the restaurant a nice, modern but stylish interior. the restaurant is fairly small. the owner and staff have personal attention for everyone. owner, staff and chef are all italians which adds to the atmosphere and authenticity of the place. when it comes to the food and wines, they know what they are doing. everything is fresh and well prepared. after many trips to all parts of italy, i can safely say that the food served here is as authentic as can be. good food, good drinks and a friendly atmoshere. you cant go wrong with gran sass "
"great italian, not the simple traditional one, but a real fine one, each day evening menu is a surprise and has never been a disappointment. excellent food and wine. great cook, great service with it, and angelo what an italian charm."
we found this restaurant unexpectedly while walking through the charming old streets of old rijswijk.  we were greeted with a lovely welcome and had great service from all the staff.  the food was just perfect and matched the warm and inviting atmosphere.
"very friendly, verry welcome, verry helpfull! ah yes and the cook verry good!"
"you are warmly greeted when you walk into gran sasso. located in the heart of the older part of the town of rijswijk, just south of den haag, it is easy to get to. the menu offers a great variety. each night there is a special 3 course meal at a discounted cost. we often find the 3 course meal more food than we want but the flavors are so well blended that we still order it. if you speak any italian the owner will be delighted and lavish you with extra attention. see http://www.gransasso.nl/ for more information"
we visit fellinis for several years now and when coming to holland it‚Äôs one of the first things we do. we visit the best italian michelin star restaurants abroad but the pizza and pasta from fellinis are seriously the best in the world! the staff is very nice and nothing is too much to ask.. the ingredients are fresh and a lot is homemade. my 4 year old never wanted to eat pizza but since he tried the one from fellinis he loves pizza! worth a visit!! 
"outstanding food, outstanding and friendly service and wonderful ambiance. the truffle pasta is to die for‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs just one of the great dishes on offer"
"this is real honest perfectly prepared food like you will find in a well known good bistro/restaurant somewhere in italy not contaminated yet by mass tourism. one tip for the chef shop for better quality lam chops with more taste. the preparation and cooking is high quality, but the meat itself is too blend. lower the amount of 4 chops to three to compensate for the higher price of better lamb. "
"excellent! a real italian restaurant with a nice atmosphere and delicious food. its like eating in italy. very nice and friendly staff and excellent food. its a must for me in this area, when i want to eat good italian food. recommended."
the surrounding is decently spoken not breathtaking.  however the food is really very good.  it doesnt matter if you choose meat or pasta or pizza. it is tasty and well prepared.  nice atmosphere and great staff.  its better to make a reservation.
"the food, wine and atmosphere takes you to ita "
"i went twice in 2 weeks to this restaurant; many locals, quite busy but very friendly atmosphere..the first time i took a pizza calzone, a bit too moisty for my taste, but reasonable. second time i took the spaghetti carbonara, good taste portion a bit sma "
been here with my family on holiday and found this location cause of tripadvisor. scepticle because of the surrounding we went in and had a wonderful dinner with perfect dishes. thank you for bringing italy in my mind and stomach. we will come again.
one should not feel worried about the surroundings of the restaurant... a meaningless shopping area in rijswijk. but the heartfelt welcome of the staff of marea and the excellent food make it more than up for the ar 
"the food is great, the atmosphere as well, so recommended! you if love real italian food, thats where you need to go."
"we had dinner there, antipasti very fresh, saltimbocca very tasty, tiramisu really homemade, you can really taste it. one of the best italian in the hague area, to be highly recommended!"
"probably chosen by a blind man during a misty night, the location of this great pizzeria is a mystery: its ensconced in an old commercial mini mall on the back of a brandless supermarket. difficult to find and easy to miss at the same time, the place doesnt look like much on the outside and is quite average inside. if you find it in your heart to forgive them their poor location, you will be rewarded with great italian food like pasta with generous shaves of truffle and cheese or fantastic pizza (try blue cheese with spinata romana).go ahead have a carb fiesta, it will put a smile on your face and wont dig a hole in your wallet!"
"its not only about the food (always fresh and amazingly good). is also about the people. if you love italy, italian food and italian people, you must love restaurant marea. hidden in the gallery, you wouldnt notice it just driving by, but be sure every evening youll find it full! it is that good"
when you enter you could think you are somewhere in the south of italy but the languages spoken are dutch and english. the pizza are very good and the crew is very friendly. reservation mandatory.
"an italian expat told me that the pizza made is marea is the only pizza in the hague and neighbourhood which is made from authentic italian ingridients. well, thats true, the pizza is absolutely decilicious and tastes different from pizzas in other location. and there are a lot of kinds of pizza hard or impossible to find in other pizzeria "
in the meantime i have visited this restaurant another three times.  it is a nice and cosy restaurant with very friendly service.
nice pizzeria with some tables outside.  we have had pizza. it has been good prepared and has been tasty.  the espresso has been also good.  friendly service.
"firstly, this restaurant has moved. the address on both tripadvisor, as well as on the restaurantt own website is wrong. we found this out only after walking for hal an hour with hungry kids. not coo "
i wanted to give 5 stars but then the beautiful blond girl said she will leave soon. 4 stars for this place with also spainish music
i know this hidden place now for several years and i have a pizza there every now and then (at least once a quarter). not the shiniest place but best value for your money and heeeeeel lekker!!!!
"been eating at casanova for years and the pizzas are great. agree with other reviewers that the decor leaves a lot to be desired and leo the owner does things his way. service can be variable, but the head waitress monique is great, so hopefully she will be on, the night you visit. can recommend the calzone, but in general all the pizzas are great."
i have ordered again and it took some time. all in all 45 minutes. they told it in advance.   the large italian pizza mexican has been tasty at usually.   very friendly delivery service.
i have ordered quite often during the last years.   my favourite is the  mexican hot & spicy  italian style. i dont like pan pizza.  the taste is great and the home delivery works very well. for me the choice in rijswijk.
"nyp makes the best pizzas: order one and you will confirm. great flavors, healthy ingredients (no e-numbers), freshly baked, quick delivery. good prices too, and always special deals. all ok!"
by far the best pizza doll i ever had. i am not sure what they put in it but i have to say it does worth every penny :)
"the owner got us a freshly made pizza as the vegetarian options in the ready-to-eat slices were next to none. loved the freshly baked, crispy medium pizza which was garnished with veggies and garlic powder."
attractive restaurant in old rijswijk. the place is beautiful and the food excellent. the variety of food and wine is superb. the only issue is that they do not accept credit cards. in todays digital world this is unacceptable. as an englishman or frenchman this means carrying cash around. in such a beautiful resto this does not make sense. it seems to be the norm in quite a few places in holland. an oddity in such a modern jurisdiction.
"randomly chosen this trattoria, situated in the nicest area of the old rijswijk, only for a drink but when i saw the oven here, we ended up ordering piz "
i have been two or three times.  it is an excellent italian restaurant in rijswijk.   may favourites are the involtini and the pizza crudo.   nice atmosphere and friendly service.
"we decided to spend our 2nd christmas evening at maximo with the family. the christmas menu was a lovely 6-course meal. starting with some anti-pasti, the 2nd course was home-made ravioli with a filling of pumpkin and cheese sauce wich was absolutely delicious! the ravioli was perfectly al dente, combined with the tasty and silky smooth filling. also the fish (zeewolf) and tenderloin with black trufflesauce were very tasty en very well prepared. maximo has the perfect location and atmosphere, the young, yet capable waiters and waitresses friendly and apt and food is delicious! we will certainly keep making the trip to enjoy good italian food at maximo. and i can‚Äôt wait for spring and summer to sit at their cosy terrace!"
"great italian place, very nice calamari, excellent pizzas, real italian feeling in rijswijk! friendly service, good menu with a wide food selection. good open wines as well. we will be back!"
"we visited maximo on a monday evening, reading all the prior reviews i was almost discouraged to do so but since all other restaurants in rijswijk were closed on monday, we gave it a go. we ended up spendig a lovely evening in a very nice setting, it was very warm, the fire place was on, nice music contibuted to a very relaxing athosphere. i would really like to compliment the two waiters, they were young but very attentative and professional. we ate parmiggiana and seafood pasta and house made tiramissu, which was especially delicious. the food was very tasty, nicely presented and portions were quite generous. very pleasent evening and for sure we will come back to try their pizzas."
"to tell you the truth, we went for the lunch but the pasta and pizza were so good that we came back the same day for dinner, the personal is very friendly and the service was excellent."
"amazing food, amazing people, amazing service, amazing atmosphere. love going there in the mornings for a delicious espresso and a business meeting, for a lunch with my family or with business partners, for dinners... already had countless meals at maximo and maximo always delivered... and, have i mentioned the surprises from the house? sometimes it is a cheese cake, sometimes it is a delicios chefs panna cotta... it feels great to be welcomed almost like a member of the maximos family. 100% recommended."
"always a pleasant experience and good, wholesome food. maximo is usually our go-to restaurant for lunch here in our village, located on the outskirts of the hague. their extensive menu and selection of vegetarian items are ideal for my family, whose tastes are varied. the caprese and grilled aubergine and courgette sandwiches are served on oven-fresh ciabatta and served with a bit of salad garnish. the pizzas and pasta are generous as is the dessert offering, which includes one of the best tiramisus ive had. service is usually good, however, they have recently revamped their staff (and menu) and the server i had during lunch yesterday was very cordial and professional. im hoping theyll add a fixed-price lunch menu during the week which would probably be a good draw. they also have some great deals on pizza takeaway at the beginning of the week. definitely worth a try, especially if youre looking for a new regular place to feel at home and be well fed and cared for."
i went there with friends on a summer evening.  the staff were very helpful as we had a small child with us.  the restaurant is lovely inside and has a lovely terrace.  i had pizza and it was fantastic!   prices are very reasonable!
"great pizza, friendly service and stylish atmosphere - a real pearl in the heart of rijswik! perfect location for a family with small kids, free parking just by the door and spacious garden, just as in italy!"
"best italian experience up to now in holland. i decided to celebrate my birthday at maximo, and i got more that i was expected. my friends and i enjoyed a lot the delicious fresh homemade food , everything was great in taste and also thanks to the staff which was enthusiastic and welcoming. highly recommended !"
a nice place for a fine dinner with good wine with your partner or for a pizza with friends. the place is elegant and the dishes are beautifully presented.
"a tiny italian restaurant and take-away off the beaten-track serving excellent freshly made pizza and pasta dishes. small and plain, its not a place for a intimate evening but it is a bit special. my pizza was wonderfully thin and crispy, but my wifes pasta had very little of the meat it was supposed to have (ossenhaas) and the truffle was non-existent. that said, the home-made tiramisu is to die for - save space for it!"
"when we visited gioja we were blown away by the quality of the food. the taste, everything was as my friends told me. perfect. small point of improvement: the pasta with seafood was very heavy on salt. but h√©, this could happen.."
this is by far the best italian restaurant in the neighberhood; everything is freshly made by italian people for a good price. once you have been here you never want to go anywhere else!
one of the few places in the area to get a good selection of great coffees and some good cake too. the only downside is that its located in a rather bland shopping centre that you wont be in for long enough to warrant stopping for an extra half-hour for the coffee.
this restaurant opened in april 2017 and was a succes from the start. the family run restaurant offers very good quality coffee and food.
this review is about the beachline in ‚Äòs gravesande. it is a beach sports outfit but also very much a regular beach club where you can have a drink or eat food. innovative and working very well is their ordering via a table specific qr code which leads to a well working mobile web site. no more waiting for the waiter! delivery was quick and accurate.
it was a very funny trip and the workers are very friendly. the wind was good at this day. first it is hard to learn but when you know it you can drive fast.
nice place to have fun on the beach. lots of different activities from adventures to just fun. professional guidance from supervisors that will stay with you throughout the entire activity and make sure you have a great time. afterwards you can enjoy a nice meal in the beach pavilion.
"simple but cosy beach pub, with good food. tuna salad on ciabatta was very nice; wiekse witte as tap beer in the sun at the wind shielded terrace was great. toilets not so clean, unfortunately."
"cozy italian, a little pricey but pleasant. things we lik "
"wonderful pizzeria with traditional stone oven. tasty and sumptuous pizzas, pastas and more. perfect for a date, family dinner or just take away even. competent pricing, value for money and a cosy ambience."
"this review is especially for italians. if youre looking for a very good pizza with birra moretti, bruschette, sorbetto al limone and much more just come over. you can find also home made linguine and ravioli. its a tiny cosy place, always crowded so reservation is a must. its not for a quiet romantic night out but if youre looking for a good pizza this is the pla "
"great pizza, owner and staff very friendly and helpful  i highly recommend this restaurant  good selection of pizzas and starters and a range of delicious homemade desserts"
"good authentic italian pizzeria with quality ingredients, traditional stone oven method of baking, justifies slightly expensive menu. you can choose to enjoy the ambience in the restaurant with some wine or coffee, if not, you can just take-away your order. either way one would be full and delighted by tasty pizza "
"what a nice surprise! me and my wife are always looking for a good pizza place- well we found an excellent one, with a very quaint nicely decorated interior, good service, tastey pizza, very nice house wine, finishing with a great lemon tiramisu. highly recommended-we will be making this one of our regular stops."
"very nice returent,  the prices are great, and the service is wonderful. comfy and charming place, good for families"
"one of the best pizzas in the utrecht area. very good wood-fired pizza. friendly staff. cozy place to eat, although i normally take out."
"honestly, the oven pizza here is awesome!  i felt as if i were eating back in italy. i never expected to find such authentic, cozy italian place in utrecht area. they focus on quality rather than quantity."
"again we ordered some pizzas here. pasta is not an option yet, its all about pizza and anti past "
pizza and pasta a la mama! very good food served by friendly staff. all the right flavors are there. ingredients were very fresh and tasty and that my friends is the most i lik 
"very small restaurant that also makes pizzas for take away. the pizzas are light and thin with a loverly crispy dough. they are absolutely delicious and you can see that the owners truly care about their food. unfortunately , the pizza are so light that they are also not terribly filling. my kids managed to finish their grown up pizzas without batting an eye, which meant that as an adult with an average to larger apetite you leave feeling like you could probably have eaten at least another half pizza. but at 12 euros for a pizza, you dont."
eating with family for a nice christmass  5 course meal. great service and even better food. authentic italian food and great wines !
well we were very hungry and had a very good restaurant in our mind. we had heard some good things about this restaurant and we give it a t 
"amici is turning a page and is gradually upgrading, the owner is back in the kitchen doing the thing he loves, service is a combination of italian flair and youthful enthusias "
i went here with a person who was allergic to gluten and lactose. i informed ahead and told marco what she wanted to eat and he made sure that the diner was allergen free. the food was amazing in taste and we had beef that was so soft you could almost suck it and grilled to perfecti 
"almost every 2 weeks we get pizza for take away. they are the real italian pizzas! once a while we eat in the restaurant, very nice people and the real italian stuff! dont forget to bring something from the wine shop!"
"a good variety of italian appetisers, main courses, sides and desserts. set meals are huge, so make sure you ask about it or at least share with friends. vegetarians and vegans are welcome and the staff speaks good italian and english (as well as dutch, of course) at this cosy restaurant with a rustic atmosphere."
i was so excited to hear that they were opening an italian restaurant right in our little town of vleuten. a real authentic italian restaura 
"finally an italian restaurant, in the area, that makes me feel back to my country: the friendly people, the quality of the food, the quantity of the food, that wood pizza oven. all the ingredients to make me looking forward to go back again."
"authentic italian food and service. the spaghetti vongole tasty, risotto milanese made well and the panzerotti very good. service good, quick and attentive. table close to door spoiled the fun for a few minutes as winter temp. was allowed in. suggestion to already good staff; take even more time to explain food presented. in short; please visit as we will for sure again."
the ice cream here is very good. on a warm day me and my son always go here to buy a cone of the home-made italian ice cre 
"been coming here for years, still havent found my favorite cause the sandwiches are all favorites! the coffee is of good quality, the ice creams very tasty. best option in town!"
"stopped here on a very hot and sunny day for some icecreams and were not dissapointed. located in the center of vleuterweide, this little cafe offers fresh icecreams, sweets and tasty sandwiches."
"small deli with seats for approximately 16 people. we came in at a quiet time and ordered a large bun and a sandwich. unfortunately the spelt bread was sold out, but the waitress asked me politely if it was okay if she made my sandwich with a wholegrain bun instead. fine with me, glad she asked. the bread was fresh, crisp and royally covered. the pastries made me drool, but i didnt try those.. hope someone else will and let me know if they were just as tasty as they looked."
"tasty pizza. can be even better if they add more garlic oil in the bred. other than that, the food is ok. chicken is very good."
lovely pizza very good customer service and delivered very fast. would recommend to everyone. go here every week
"i‚Äôm from albania and i have never eaten at such an amazing restaurant in my life, i want to thank the people who work at new york pizza ‚Äúmaarssen‚Äù for my pizzas thank you so much i love you forever"
i love the american crust pizzas they offer. the 35 cm is good for 2 persond. service and staff very friendly
"i must say this was one of the best pizzas, if not the best pizza i have ever had. their service is amazing and whenever they give you the pizza the walk around and hold the door open for you. this is a place where everyone should go. not only is the food the best. but also the service. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"great pizzas (secret recipe??) and good deals too. you might get addicted :-)  and they have some new flavours now, gyros and chicken avocado. sounds healthy to me.  ps: love their lava cake."
"i love the pizzas, they also have really nice burgers. wil def come back again! also right across the train station. (:"
very nice restaurant above all to sit outside in a sunny day. the italian owner is very professional and polite. pizza is great!
this is a great local restaurant with a interesting and tasty menu featuring various food ranging from local specialities to a dish with 5 different indonesian curries. there is a good selection of beers. the restaurant decor is nice and the bar area is music themed. staff are extremely friendly. the is in the hometown from a work colleague and one of his favorites in the are. i plan to return.
"it was indische avond when we last visited de noot. 3 courses of gorgeous indian food, we ate it all."
"we eat here fairly early on a friday evening in october. it was very quiet but the pizzas were good and the service very friendly,"
ive been there for a pizza and i discover a verry nice restaurant with a good service and a big menu.
"i had visited this restaurant on december 2016. i found it a nice place, lovely workers with a great hospitality and friendly atmosphere. the food was delicious especially the pizza and the shoarma. the prices were very reasonable. we spent a lovely evening there. i hope to return back someday."
the service was paerfect. the waitress was very friendly and poli 
"since i discovered papa johns i can‚Äôt eat other pizzas in amsterdam. the pizza is almost all the times really soft and delicious, tanks also to the unique salsa garlic! but a special thank you to the super positive girl delivering me the pizza by car, sometimes i wait too much but its worth it!!! when you will see her you will forget all the time that you waited, she changed my day a lot of times!"
"very good pizza, i really enjoyed it and recommend it! :) thank you pizzaiolo andrea!!! i will be back."
the best pizza in amsterdam!!!the pizza four cheeses was delicious and creamy!  highly recommended!!!
"the menu at margherita tutta la vita is a celebration of authentic italian cuisine, with a focus on wood-fired pizza and homemade pasta in a funky decoration environment. the ingredients are fresh and of high quality, resulting in dishes that are bursting with flavor. the pizza crust is thin and crispy, with just the right amount of char from the wood-fired oven, and the toppings are generous and full of taste. the pasta dishes are cooked to perfection, with rich and flavorful sauces that are made in-house. each dish is a true taste of italy, and you can tell that the chefs take pride in their craft. the prices are also very decent, 15eur for a pizza in amsterdam? "
pizzas were good but a bit on the expensive side. service was friendly even though it was rush hour. bonus points for multiple vegan options. one of the better options to check out.
"the chairs are sh1tty. the pizza is good. the quality of the pizza is high compared to the low prices, thats great. drinks are a bit small."
we stopped off on the way into diemen suid and the pizza was exceptional. highly recommended and very tasty
"definitely the best pizza in amsterdam! a friend of mine suggested me this place once, but honestly i was sceptical at first after several bad experiences with italian restaurants in the netherlands, which could not give me the feeling i was eating the food of my homeland. this place is different: the vibe, the personnel and the food, they all make me feel like i were back home. if i ever feel homesick, i know this is the place to go!"
"by far the best place in the whole of netherlands. authentic, real passionate food and atmosphere. prices are and quality are italian and far above any dutch standard. check this place out and...you will fall in lov "
"best pizza of my life, nicest people, great team üòç i will warmly recommemd it to everyone! thank you!"
"all the pizzas are really good, never disappointed when eating here. staff is also really friendly. only thing that it can be really noisy"
very very good pizza made with good quality ingredients. the place is full every day of the week so it is good to make a reservation beforehand. other things on the menu are not the best but the pizza beats it.
"real italian taste and atmosfere, amazing pizza and (home made!) pasta :) pizza is made in a traditional way thats why is soooo gooood and unique in amsterdam. stuff is very helpfull, nice and professional, all the time! the prices are very affordable especially when compared to the quality ‚ù§ best place to go! book the table its always busy there! fully recommended üôÇ"
this was quite possibly the best pizza i‚Äôve ever eaten! the staff were incredibly helpful and the food arrived very quickly. my only regret is that i didn‚Äôt take any pictures before wolfing down the food. definitely recommended!
"a really nice casual restaurant! very good prices, quality of food was also excelent, generous portions! totally recommended!"
"quite good for nl. this is not roman or napolitan pizza though. i think the guys running it are calabrians so it is a calabrian version :) spicy, oily and bit crusty. if you want something hot and super filling order their volcano pizza. it will keep u full till next day. "
"welcoming and familiar atmosphere like being in italy. fresh italian and genuine products. spectacular dishes of the authentic italian cuisine. delicious pizzas with low prices. fast and always available staff. highly recommended, not to be missed if you are in the area."
"if you want to have a really taste of italy, that‚Äôs the right place! pizza is outstanding, good quality ingredients, the dough is perfect and the nduja from calabria is super! the tiramisu is next level, so yummy!! the service was nice and italian, attentive, and friendly! the best pizza in amsterdam so far! good job margherita tutta la vita! grazie"
"the family name is secret pizza since it is difficult to find and if you don‚Äôt know of this hidden gem, only worth of mouth will guide you here. that being said, it is well worth the exploration - nothing here disappoints. the staff is friendly and responsive, the pizzas and pasta fresh and absolutely fantastic (and the 2 sizes offered fantastic for families with children), deserts wickedly good (if you have room) and prices incredibly reasonable. in short - no reason to not go, but recommend a reservation as walk-in can be a gamble given the popularity of the place. "
as i live and work close to tutta la vita i come here regularly. i always have a pizza and my favorite is sarenza 
we went there in three for dinn 
this place was great. a hidden jewel. really good pizza. one of the best i have had in a while and a really nice straff! visit this place! üíñ
"the pizzeria is in a students campus, right next to the metro diemen zuid. the location is humble but the food is fantastic. for me stillone of the best and authentic pizzas of amsterdam. you get great food (try also the cannoli for desert!!) for a good price and people are nice and the place is really italian. if i miss italy i go there to eat. fantastici!"
the staff is friendly and greets you even if they are free. the food is lovely and the prices are very good. the best itialian in town!!!
"the restaurant is close to a metro station, out of amsterdam centre. on the wednesday evening we went it was very full and lively. service was friendly and efficient, and the pizzas were delicious. three of the four of us were unable to finish ours as they were such a good size, but the leftovers were packed up for us to take away."
"a great place to sit outside in the sun, and delicious food for a good price! as this is quite a boring neighbourhood, it being mainly residential, i was really happy when these italian heroes came to stay!"
best pizza in the netherlands!!! really welcoming staff and wonderful food!!!!  stefano is the best karaoke limoncello night
"excellent italian food for a decent price. in my opinion normal size pizza can be split for two people (unless you eat a lot on daily basis). crispy, delicious and well prepared. pasta also looks very promising but i didnt had opportunity to try one. i was just a bit disappointed that a couple of positions from pasta menu were unavailable around noon (12:00). polite and helpful staff is working there."
"as an italian i can safely say that i‚Äôve had a lot of pizza in my life, but at margherita tutta la vita it is sooooooo good. i honestly struggle to find a pizza this good in italy let alone in the netherlands. the vibe is great, the staff is great, everything is great! awesome to go with friends, family or even alone!!!"
"i love this pizzeria and their pizza. i love thin and slightly crusty pizza, with carefully thought ingredients. and if you want anything else on your pizza, or you want something left out, no problem whatsoever. the service is always with a smile and there is always the possibility to have a doggy bag if you cant eat all of what you ordered. the pasta is hand made by a lovely lady from bologna, i love her tortelloni. the best pizzeria so far in holland"
my friends introduced me to this place who live in dieme 
we found this as we moved nearby! but wish i had known it earlier! perfect pizza! home made pasta en delicious antipasti! only one risk to become a bit addicted to the pizza! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
christmas lunch. food good but particularly impressed with service - smart enough to start prep of pizzas before we had ordered so food arrived in good time.  good value too.
"great pizzas with fresh, genuine ingredients. perfectly baked in the wood fired oven. some appetizers, homemade pasta and desserts. good simple wines and great beers. we regularly come all the way from amsterdam centre to eat here. my daughter simply loves it. it is the only place in amsterdam really like a local pizzeria in italy: simple, delicious food , friendly and informal service, incredible value for money."
"amazing place!! awesome pizza!! nice environment, friendly staff!! try tiramisu as well!  highly recommended for authentic italian pizzas!"
"often go back to this place for their delicious pizza. it is located near a student campus and thankfully isnt overpriced and is affordable for those on a lower budget. do keep in mind that the place is really busy and its best to make a reservation, otherwise you might end up without a table. their pizzas are made in an authentic pizza oven and the staff are friendly too. not sure about their other courses, only tried the lasagna which was nice as well, but if you had to pick between the two, go for the pizza! their chocolate cake is delicious as well!"
"went there last sunday with my son and family who live in amsterdam. we ate pizza and pasta and it was excellent. the waiter was gracious and helpful, the food, beer and wine was good. the value was also good and we were given three limoncello on the house. will definitely return there, given the chance."
"after searching for a real italian pizza in the amsterdam and surrounding we have finally found a real pizzeria. personnel is very friendly, children are very welcome and pizza is really delicious!"
"visited on sunday afternoon with my wife a daughter, great atmosphere, great service, and food to die for, the pizza where the best i have eaten in amsterdam seeing that i have lived here fo 20 years that‚Äôs some praises, this will defiantly become a regular visit."
"i was in netherlands with my friends, and we were staying in a hotel near this pizzeria. when we first arrived, we went there for lunch. the waiter wasn‚Äôt from netherlands (i think), but he spoke perfect english and knew how to communicate with customers. he was really upbeat, fun, kind-overall, a sweetheart. he even made our pizzas look like hearts. best pizza i had in a long tim "
"margherita tutta la vita is a great place for authentic italian food, conveniently located on campus. their pizzas are fantastic, just like the pizza in italy! i cant fault in any way the food here. there is a great atmosphere here, and the perfect place to relax with friends at the end of a busy day. prices are very student friendl "
"this is a wonderful restaurant, with good food and people. i ud√¨sed to go ones per week because is also cheap. higly recommended love it!!"
really best italian pizza and pasta i ever tried in the netherlands! kind and helpful staff. close to the station.
"the service depends on who is on duty and the way they feel.  when the guy cuts the cheesecake, its super tiny. when one of the ladies cuts the cheesecake, you get what you pay for.  the pizza is always good overhere."
i used to come here almost weekly when i was still working in the neighborhood (and when margherita tutta la vita was still operating from a stand in front of the nearby school 
good pizza - fresh ingredients -  wood oven - nice atmosphere - friendly and young staff - terrace - beer.
great food and atmosphere. good price too. home made pasta. very friendly staff. everything was great!
"very nice selection of pizzas and the dough is good!i prefer a thicker pizza, but its only my taste!"
"together with a group of colleagues we ate here with one of our italian collegaues who loves this place. despite being a large group (around 16) they managed to serve everyone at once. the food was great: fresh, good portions, great flavours. the staff are very friendly and helpful, and even happier if you happen to speak italian. definitely a recommendation for a tasty simple meal."
"looks like a restaurant in italy! good pizza, pasta and salads. will come back. ingredients fresh..."
"amazing pizza, none better around. we usually take out, but this time we ate it there. big difference (crust is perfect.) they have a real wood fire brick oven so they have the best crust. you cannot go wrong with any choice, buffalo bill is our favourite. if you bring it home it does get a bit soggy, so eat fast. :) also, the kids can go get an ice cream, a real cone. they love it."
"one of the best pizzerias in and around amsterdam. real italian pizzas for good prices. try the amico gio or the salame dolce, or the dama bianca. no matter which one you pick, theyre all amazing."
"granted ... it is a little out of the way, but that detour is so worth it. the dough is great, the toppings/combinations innovative but the flavour is unparallel "
"very nice and attentive staff, prices are low and the ice cream is tasty - 5 stars, what else can i say"
"good quality food, but the owned fakes to be an italian .... h√® is not. using honest products and h√® had good teachers"
"thank you so much for a great evening. we were made very welcome and the owner had a lot of time for us, she was very friendly and we will be back to visit. the food was outstanding. we had a starter to share which was antipasti and then homemade lasagna and spaghetti fruits de mare everything was very good. wine, coffee and sambuca was very quality too. thank you sorella we will see you again soon."
had fun with the young guy who goes to liverpool and speaks wonderful english he was really helpful to us a party of german and british. very smart restaurant very clean and stylish and good reasonable food. terrace to sit and watch the people go by. highly recommended 
"sunny and cosy terrace in the heart of sluis, very good and affordable italian snacks and dishes. been here a few times and never dissapoints."
great place to visit. it is a bistro with a small but delicious menu and fast friendly service. just as down to earth as the rest of sluis. enjoy it on a ‚òÄÔ∏è day!
"lovely decor, theyve really made an effort with designing the interior & choosing chairs & colours that are modern, yet co "
we had two marinara pizzas here and they were delicious. we saw other pizzas on other tables and they looked amazing too. the service was friendly and it had a cosy feeling.
the greek restaurant we wanted to go to was closed so we tried this place instead. we werent disappointed as the pasta dishes were very tasty and the portions substantial too.
"so let me start by telling you the food here is delicious and the staff is very friendly abd helpful. everything we ordered looked and tasted delicious. the childrens beefsteak was rare, but we wanted it medium... no problem really, but something you should be aware of. another thing that was really negative (and would have normally deserved negative 2 points) was the state of the toilets... not nice. something like that shouldnt happen to a restaurant of this standing."
"had a great dinner at la sicilia... my dutch friends told me it was good, but i didnt know how much! even better than some italian restaurant in italy! the appetizers were great, fish and meat fresh and good. pasta was really italian and pizza was also very goo "
"the family run a very fine restaurant with quality products, partly supplied by their own super delicatessen across the street. wonderful cheeses, hams and a variety of good sausages and much more recommended !! ."
we called in here during or corso visit. they fitted us in upstairs where 6 of liberally embibed may not have been the best guest 
"we were driving on our bike to rooterdam en when we came back we were very hungry and went to this restaurant. there were not many man to eat, but it was cozy. the pizza which we ordered was perfect en more than enough. just go here and enjoy."
"a real pleasure. delicious simple italian food in a pleasant atmosphere. a top vitello tonnato and superb grilled lamb. decent quality chardonnay at an affordable price. light, airy, cosy decor. owner came to our table to see if all was ok. all-in-all good food at good value with attentive service."
"nice italian food. very generous portions. decor a bit old fashionned, maybe. cuisine is classical italian food, well prepared and served in generous portions. we especially liked the carpaccio, the lasagna and the basilicum cr√®me br√ªl√©e."
"had dinner here in july 2016. there is a nice, big terrace in front of the restaurant. we first had a drink at this terrace before we went inside. we had a nice table in the patio. the outside area on th backside of the restaurant is protected from rain and win "
"it is hard, if no impossible, to find genuine italian food abroad. and here you are...in the middle of nowhere, adjacent to a vacation resort, pops up this place that gets pretty close to the real thing. of course, they cater to a vast majority of dutch and german tourists and they have to keep that into account. but still: the pastas a pretty close to the original recipes, the pizzas are as close as youll get in holland and - believe it or not - even the espresso is a genuine, italian tasting espresso, as opposed to the muck one gets served too often in the netherlands. so bravo all over. biggest disappointment: kitchen closes extremely early."
fairly good italian food. the large round tables were well suited for group conversations during dinner. the food was served quickly after ordering. i could recommend the spaghetti corbonara and the saltimbocca with fries as a side dish.
"nice restaurant next to the complex office. friendly staff,and a good menu for all tastes. the lasagna was excellent. good choice of wines by the glass. friendly staff."
nice & quit place to have some ice cream and or coffee. very friendly staff with good service. i would recommend them and i would go back for some more ice cream.
"i am from australia and doing a european tour with my wife and i must admit i ate like in italy, especially the pizza ,just like the napolitano pizza, and there staff were courteous . i will certainly return."
"our favorite restaurant! the combination of great italian food and warm, friendly and personal staff & ownership makes this a place you‚Äôd want to visit over and over again (which we do). the chef is italian and the ownership is partly italian, which makes the restaurant stand out. you will not find all traditional ‚Äúdutch italian‚Äù dishes but instead you‚Äôll notice a variety of local and creative italian deliciousness! the wines are good, let charlotte advise you! so if you‚Äôre up for a great night our with local italian food and staff that just knows how to make your evening amazing, you should definitely go here."
"we went here for dinner several times already, and the food is always delicious. what makes this place even better, is the staff; they‚Äôre always super friendly and very personal. prices are very acceptable, especially given what you get for it in terms of food and service. be sure to take some time when dining here; you can easily spend several hours, as the atmosphere is just great. an absolute recommendation; you should definitely go for dinner here when you‚Äôre visiting reeuwijk (or surrounding villages, such as bodegraven and gouda)."
"great new owners for the italian restaurant  in reeuwijk. nice service, good menu all at your door steps and open on mondays all at reasonable pricing !!!  worth exploring and enjoying."
"very good italian restaurant in the city center of drunen. the food is just amazing, so are the wines. service is super friendly and has lots of knowledge. and all this for very reasonable prices.  you can call this a hidden gem of drunen."
there used to be a different restaurant on this spot but since a while there is an italian restaurant at the corner of the central square in drunen and it is more plush than the name la cantina suggests. it has nice seats and tables for different sizes of parties and only when you are with 6 or more people it is necessary to make a reservation. in front of the restaurant there is also a big terrace outside overlooking the square with plenty of sunshine (because it is situated southward 
great italian food where you wouldnt expect it. nice views of the river in the summer and terrace. you may need to book though. the food was great and affordable.
"very lovely choice between hot and cold small dishes, as much as you can eat. with a tasty desert table to finish with a white and brown chocolate fountain. good service and nice atmosphere."
"not knowing what to expect, it was double pleasure when one is explained the concept of the restaurant: it is all one can eat but in a luxe offering! the menu card has about 17 entrees, about 23 main dishes and the dessert buffet very complete! every dish presented in a very elegant way, tasting delicious and making you want for more, which is great as one can just keep on ordering üòä! and... everything (except dessert) is brought to the table, so the relaxing atmosphere and comfortable seating arrangement provided is not interrupted! we had a very nice evening and for sure shall return!"
"we had a great evening! the location is good, it was easy to park, the staff was very friendly. i was most impressed with the food , a new concept of all you can eat! the food was deliciously and the presentation was very good. it is worth to come here again! you won‚Äôt be regret it."
"food is always amazing, great selection of really good wines and the service surpasses that of any dutch restaurant"
we went there with a family of 5. had some awesome food and the staff is very nice and caring. have been here a couple times and the take away food is also nic 
"the outside differs totally from the inside..almost a hidden gim.. we had scampis as a starter, deer as main (very delicious) and tiramisu to end. presentation can be better but you dont expect it in this kind of restaurants. friendly staff!"
under the smoke of rotterdam excellent food for a reasonable price. extensive food and beverage menu very friendly service. life entertainment. ample parking
great italian restaurant and we ate there for two nights. excellent welcome from sharon who couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. delicious food all round. pizzas are enormous! penne carbonara is highly recommended. thank you for two excellent evenings.
"we went for dinner and had a nice time. the staff were friendly and efficient. the food was very tasty. i had the pizza which i thoroughly enjoyed although it was very large so i couldn‚Äôt finish it, but they offered me a takeaway box so i could finish it later."
pizza is definitely to recommend. looking forward to try other stuff. only one remark: inner space need a little renovation. maybe more modern look?
"we were there on a tuesday evening where every pizza is 7,50‚Ç¨. we came in and the restaurant was quite full. later we recognized wh "
"went to have dinner and we both ordered pizza. pizza was very good, typically italian. its a good restaurant with gentle owners, they always like to chat with costumers."
"for me the best italian restaurant in the netherlands. i live close by and its the only place i go for pizza, pasta and really great quality meat and fish. i usually take one of the fish or meat plates as i can take pizza to go. the mix grill is also supper yummy. tuesdays very busy so i would recommend wednesday or thursda "
"the food is great!, lovley family restaurant , must visit if you are in the area. sardinian food is just great!. wines from sardinia are simply the best"
"good pizza, friendly service, nice terrace, the noisy trains passing by is the only negative i can think of. worth a visit if you are passing by."
went here as two couples and a baby. the owners were friendly and helpful. service was great and food was delicious. the chef even made more for my friend (no request) as they felt the portion was too small! would recommend to anyone who wants an authentic italian meal.
we stayed in a hotel next to this restaurant and we came one evening to have some appetizer only. so we selected cured beef and pork from starters section of me 
we were arriving in the hoek by ferry and i pre-booked breakfast at this restauran 
found that restaurant by chance when stranded in hoek van holland for a day. we could go and have a family meal and not to have to leave our dog behind in the hotel. service superb. menu quite varied. presentation excellent and dishes delicious. would visit again for sure.
"this has to be the best restaurant we have ever visited. it is modern, clean and has excellent service, the menu has something for everyone. our food was out of this world. please visit this restaurant and you will not be disappointed."
"this has to be the nicest restaurant we have eaten in! we have eaten in many restaurants all over the world and honestly, this topped them all!! excellent service, modern and clean. we had a starter of crab/avocado and charcuterie and our main meal consisted of fillet steak and fried risotto with goats cheese. the steak was done perfectly and the risotto was so tasty, nothing can compare. we had a house red. this is a must. the staff were very attentive and friendly."
"with nearly 3 hours to wait for our return ferry to harwich we decided to go into the town for a meal, to avoid the taste restaurant on the stena britannica. the only decent looking restaurant (italian) is closed on monday & tuesday and we didnt like the look of the egyptian so we decided to try the gentile restaurant in the grand hotel. we were pleasantly surprised. we had the two vegetarian options on the menu and these were both excellent, as was the glass of beer. the staff all spoke english and were very helpful. the bill came to just over ¬£20 each - very reasonable."
"with a few hours to spend before our ferry trip to england, it was time for dinner in the hook of holland. when in doubt, look for a trip advisor sticker on the door and i am so glad we dined at the gentile restaurant at the grand hotel. service was fast, friendly, and professional from multi-lingual staff. and the food was superb and a beautiful surprise in both taste and appearance. one could view the chef adding garnishes to the plates at the kitchen servery before they were whisked away to diners and what care he took. my thinly sliced scallops with tender squid entree was exquisite. meals are honest with no excess clashing of flavours."
"i did not like the two man a little bit to close to our table speaking very loud a language that seems to be from south germany and drinking to much big beers,"
we were guests in the grand hotel associated with this restaurant. we were intending to just have a drink in the outside area but were tempted by the very friendly staff to take a look at the menu. this turned out to be a great mo 
"good food. real italian. i can especially recommend the meat and fish dishes. fair pricing. they dont have a wide variety of wines, but they do have some good ones."
"went there with colleagues, and most had the tournedos with a specific sauze. the waiter had alot of problems figuring out what sauze was on what plate (they look alike), not really a problem ofcourse, but it was fun. the food was really exeptionally good. service was great. even got a limoncello on the house."
we had the best pizza the service is was outstanding food good and the wine is top of the range we are happy to recommend this place for any occasion and urge readers to look no further
"i ordered home delivery: parmigiana di melanzane, pizza marinara, cannoli siciliani and a dish out of their standard menu:mozzarella in carrozza. my mother is from a little village close to naples and makes the best parmigiana di melanzane in the world. gigino parmigiana di melanzane is as delicious as the one of my mother. excellent. pizza is fresh, thin in the center and soft and crunchy on the sides, respecting ingredients and consistency as per tradition. is the first time i am served in the netherlands a real pizza marinara even better than many pizzas i ate in italy. mozzarella in carrozza outside layer is done according to tradition, crunchy, and tasty as it should be. very good. looking forward to taste all of their dishes from naples tradition. recommended for takeaway and home delivery during these days of covid special measures. "
"this small cafeteria is located in downtown berschenhoek. while mostly for take-away, they are an excellent choice to stay for a nice dinner if you dont feel for the full blown restaurant experien "
"this is a mindfully designed gem: the right decor, down to the details, an impressive yet cozy bar, the perfect mix of jazz music to complete the ambiance. even sitting outside feels like being transported to the 1920s, everything slows down , one is overcome by a relaxed and joyful feeling. the cocktails are amazing and the borski beer is delicious! the food is nicely presented and everything is fresh and tasty. i love that the portions arent huge so its possible to taste several different dishes. the service is superb."
fabulous dinner in a beautiful art deco style environment. dishes were good for sharing and our absolute favorite was the dish with a creme br√ªl√©e of duck liver. the waiters were very nice and one of them gave really good wine advice to accompany the various dishes (both the red and white macon villages were excellent). the restaurant is just outside haarlem and definitely worth the detour!
this was the second time we eat at the restaurant and it was very good the first time. but the wedding  food and service was outstanding  i would recommend this for any large function
"stayed at the oranjerie for a business meeting. the location is great, situated in a park of an old mansion. the atmosphere in the old building is relaxing, the staff is very good and always present on a pleasent discrete way. the lunch and diner were very good. the coffee was however less. one of the disatvantadges of this location is the location of the parking lot. you have to park at about 8 to 10 walking minutes away (depending on the amount of rain). at the parking site the direction to the oranjerie is signed very very poor so the possibilityu is that you get lost in the park."
what a dream! this is the most italian part of italy in the netherlands. it is hidden quite well so you must really know where you‚Äôre going but it is absolutely worth the effort. we had spaghetti with shrimps and a pizza. i was blown away by the refined taste. we sat outside in the lovely garden where fresh herbs and spices are grown. the garden is a 1000 square meter representation of heaven. should you be in neighbouring zoetermeer or gouda - make sure you‚Äôll venture out to buon gusto in moerkapelle. trust me : it will be a night to remember!
"this medium-sized restaurant is a hidden gem in moerkapelle. looking for some ice-cream on a sunny afternoon, we stumbled upon an ice-cream cart with a tastefully decorated outside area and restaurant behind it. olive and oak trees were growing, with nice tables and parasols in between. at the back is a small wooden cubbyhouse for the children and an elaborate herb and flower garden where you can walk through. the staff are friendly and happy to make a chat. the ice-cream was nice and cheap, although you do get quite a small portion and there are only 4 choices, but the children were happy with it. we had a cappuchino and a coffee latte, both tasteful. in the end, it turned out to be a great place to have a break and relaxed time with the kids. for a moment it feels like you step out of holland and straight into romantic italy :-)"
"great food, very friendly staff and so happy we found a place for diner around 9pm. thanks for the service!"
took a chance and did not regret it. friendly staff and food was piping hot and delicious. both cannelloni and the restaurants signature dish were plentiful and worth a try.
good selection of italian food. we all had pizza and was a hit with us all especially the kids. service was good and the waiting staff made a real effort to engage with us
stumbled on this when walking around eersel and so glad we did. such good value and the most amazing ice cream selection. people seemed to be driving there just for an ice cream and you could see why. we ended up visiting another 3 times while staying nearby as the kids loved it
"worth the extra mile to get there - the selection is great, the taste of the ice cream excellent. we (5 adults) all left with the same judgement - we will come back next time we are in the area!"
"there was a bit of a line for this ice cream store but it was well worth it. the ice cream is fab, with lots of different and interesting flavours. i also got a cappuccino but that was just pretty avera "
the ice cream is wonderful.  a lot of different tastes! if you are in eersel you must definitely try this ice cream.
this has to be the best ice cream shop in existence! it‚Äôs teally reasonably priced (less than 2 euros for 2 large scoops of ice cream) and there are so many flavours to choose from. the staff speak english and you can try before you buy. best thing- if you order a coffee you also get s tiny little ice cream cone too!
"this is the best place where i ate ice-cream. they have so many tastes, its very hard to choose :) in 4 years i have tried them all <3  this is definitely a place not to miss if you are in brabant."
we searched round eersel for a quiet and reasonably priced place to eat. spotted eethuis amun and although it did not seem to be great surroundings we were very pleasantly surprise 
"i really liked the cooking,the service and the atmosphere.i will back for sure!!! i was with my family"
"small but cosy italian place. real woodfire oven and terrific pizzas. also small mennu with pastas, antipasti etc."
"we had a walking dinner, the quality and quantity were what excellent, good variety, different tastes."
as a regular guest of the bar and restaurant in the steigenberger hotel i was made aware by the hotel staff about the italian restaurant there is in the hote 
"very nice tortellini and wine..! i visit the restaurant with my girlfriend and we had a very relaxing evening. the decoration,the food but also the amazing service from a true italian woman. i recommend this place as they really know what they doing..!!"
stopped for a baquette and drinks before boarding our flight. service was ok despite only being one member of staff working but it was early in the morning. good selection of food and drinks.
"it was a pleasant surprise to find a jamie oliver outlet in amsterdam‚Äôs schipol airport following the collapse of his jamie‚Äôs italian empire in the u.k. some excellent breakfast baps with bacon and a crispy ham and cheese croissant. counter service was a tad slow,"
"the food and coffee was good. there are outlets for charging and plenty of seating. staff were only ok. the young guy who waited on us was inattentive and appeared bored. i had a ham & cheese croissant which was a bit small, but was flaky, cheesy and very tasty. hubby had a ham & cheese toasty which was also good. we shared a caramel muffin and each had a latte."
"shocked by the 2 star review as the experience i had was outstanding! i had a delicious margarita pizza, can honestly say the best i‚Äôve ever had. mouth wateri "
as far as an airport lunch goes it was fantastic.   food good fresh and warm.   a little more attention to tidying tables and wiping them down although people start sitting before you kind of leave.
excellent selection of foods. fresh and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants at t3 departures. staff helpful and friendly.
i have been helped greatly by nice people who knew how to make coffee!  made my day just before boarding!
food was good enough for airport food. we were served by tina who smiled and danced and made us happy :)
really good tuna sandwich along with ceaser salad and pepperoni pizza all nicely served by ella and shanti
"can i please take a moment to express my pleasure to have visited this place before my flight. thank you gilles, lenisha and dominique - you were super friendly. to be frank, this is the first time i get such a warm hospitality at an airport cafe/restaura "
"i had the penne bolognese, a chocolate brownie and orange smoothie.  the menu choices were limited but the food itself was delicious and great value for money.  ellen & gilles were both very friendly and helpful."
"was a pleasure between all the fast food stands.  if you look further then the obvious pizza slices and lasagna there are healthy salads, well prepared baguettes and more.  lovely staff like ellen and gilles. they make you feel welcome!"
"i had a pasta, really good and tasty. i saw a couple of other dishes, they looked tasty and lovely also. definitely coming back. service is nice and pleasant. thank you"
took my kids here for dinner while waiting for our next flight. the pasta and pizza were delicious! prices were good too. ellen and majid were so kind and friendly. we stayed quite awhile but they didn‚Äôt mind at all! highly recommend!
tina was very professional and assisted in providing us delicious food during my transit through the netherlands. i definitely recommend jamie‚Äôs deli to anyone especially when tina is there providing service.
the food was good. the green smoothie was amazing but the best was the service!  easy stop inside the airport
tina served me and was very polite and friendly. food was ok‚Ä¶ could be warmer. coffee and orange juice very good.
"ive just stumbled upon this place at the airport, sad and hungry. eating the mushroom pizza felt like a hug. probably one of the best pizzas ive ever had, and also the first try of jamie olivers recipe. it is about the simpe things indeed"
"open, distanced, comfortable seating. food was delicious (i had the pork sandwich). ellen‚Äôs service was fast and nice."
"i was amazed by the english breakfast meal served by dominque and giels. moreover, the seats and caf√© were clean."
"proposed by an italian friend, this place offers a different take on schiphol‚Äôs restaurant scene. affordable and tasty food and excellent service by tina & simone!"
remi and dominique were friendly and efficient and the small english breakfast tastes like it came from a classic english b&b
veggie breakfast with toast and an americano  coffee.  very nice indeed. clean and well set out restaurant  friendly staff.
"excellent service and cooking from dominique and gilles. everything on point sharp at 7am, i was the first customer."
"dominique was helpful and friendly! veggie breakfast was great, lots of vegetarian options, plenty of space to sit and relax :-)"
malisca and gilles were fantastic friendly hosts the funghi pizza was delicious thank you  maryclare and dennis
great fresh food served with a smile. loved the pizza and my husband enjoyed breakfast. recommend it highly.
"due to imposed covid measures i‚Äôve stuck in the airport for two days and maybe for 2-3 days more, during this time i had some of my meals at jamies italian, and when they (sophia and melissa) found out i was in this situation they not only gave me a discount for my meals but even offered to leave the airport to purchase fresh food to bring back and prepare for me. i was speechless to say the least at the kindness and generosity that was shown and don‚Äôt have enough kind words for them. they went above and beyond their jobs and i wish nothing but the best for these kind and beautiful soul "
"my husband and i went while waiting for our fly. i totally recommend to search for rachel, she is very kindy and helpful"
i was today at jamie oliver with my friends. we had orderd 3 lasagne it was delicys. a big men came to table ask us if we can write something at tripadvise. it was delicys thank you also for the potatos big men :)üòú
had delicious tuna and salad baguettes from here at not too bad prices at all. server at the til was very friendly and the drinks were hot and tasty too. lots of choice to eat.clean tables and plenty of seating. whats not to like
"really friendly, great service from mo. really clean and great drink selection- made very comfortable xx"
"this place is most likely an airport restaurant, good food and quick service. its way better then the ranking"
"based on the reviews here, id avoid the full-service sit-down meals and just grab a sandwich. we took two sandwiches from a prepared foods cooler -- a ham and cheese and a chicken salad. both were large and delicious. add to that two bags of potato chips and a couple of bottles of water and they were all we needed before boarding our flight. we ate in the waiting area at the gate. totally satisfactory."
"food was good. staff helpful. i feel bad for lydia, i accidentally spilled my food but she was very kind and helped me out."
"waiting for a connecting flight, this was a good choice.friendly staff, and a good assortment of food ideas. typical airport prices, but quality was good."
"ate here before fight home to stansted, it is what it is, a snack stop, not a restaurant, so dont expect full blown meals and is canteen style service. i am celiac so after living mainly on salads in amsterdam for the weekend where catering for gluten free wasnt great, i was pleased to see they had my fave, parmigiana di melanzane, on the menu. a good decent square is served up with some rocket salad and parmesan. is served up in like a cardboard bucket type thing which makes it a little tricky to eat, with plastic knives and forks, but was totally delicious. their pizzas looked amazing. my niece had a baguette which she said was really good."
"i had a great aubergine with parmesan cheese with a red wine. i really enjoyed it, specially after having so much bread and cheese. the place is a semi-fast food and offers pizzas and other stuff. not bad for the type of place."
called in here for breakfast when flying back to exeter. i opted for the complete breakfast which was served efficiently by very obliging staff. the food itself was both hot and delicious with a bit of heat and lots of herbs. really enjoyed it. what isn‚Äôt so great is the way it is served. basically it is served in a round carton usually seen as cinemas when buying pick and mix sweets. the consequence of this is that a pile of food is piled on top of itself so what should look like a really nice breakfast just looks like a mess. there are only plastic knives and forks and so as i dived in to try and get a piece of the cumberland sausage which was right at the bottom of the carton the fork broke! can i please ask you to consider the plate for such a breakfast. i know it‚Äôs not trendy or cool but it makes food look good and how you serve it now detracts from the taste. 
had a lovely penne pasta was yummy with rocket and parmesan and a lovely cup of team nice seating area and my friends enjoyed their pizza slices with balsamic oil and olive oil on every table. nice place
just had a lovely breakfast in jamies deli at schipol airport while waiting for our transfer. theres no vegan breakfast listed but everything is cooked in olive oil and i requested no eggs. dominique was lovely and asked how our meal was.
"food was so so yummy, fairly cheap considering its an airport place. tina served us both and was very sweet and lovely"
actually the food (aubergine) was very good. the service was friendly but i didnt get a napkin and forgot to ask. the tables are being cleaned as i write and they werent that b 
"a bit pricey, but so good! loved it, especially the tiny potatoes, and pulled pork was also spicy and there was a lot."
"lovely pizza have it every time we go home big hot square of margarita the mushroom one is nice to, handy always have it every time we go to airport."
"this is an airport food experience...and i was not expecting much but when i got the full breakfast i enjoyed it...especially their sausage. i would pick this spot over many at the airport...fast, filling and above average."
"a solid bbq pulled pork that saved my time in schiphol - reasonable place and nice. pleasant staff, almost forgot i was in an airport for the course of the meal."
i work on schiphol amsterdam airport. i went to jamies deli a couple of times for my dinner break. i chose this place because its relatively quite compared to other parts on the airport. food is good. especially can recommend the aubergine and superfood salad. also ordered a slice of fungi pizza. had to wait for a few minutes for this - once it arrived it was hot and fresh. pricing is quite steep. dont expect a bargain. airports are never cheap. service is friendly and there is free naturally flavored water to take.
"only one word, breakfast was great !!! especially the sausage was too delicious. when i fly again , i will taste this breakfast again !!!"
cheese toastie was hot but had retained the crispiness of toasted bread - did not go soggy.  nice airy restaurant on top level of airport near gate f3.  tables were spaced well apart which gave it a welcome feeling of calm.
i had a bacon sandwich for breakfast and drank a cappuccino. both the sandwich and the coffee were good. they made the place very nice to sit despite the fact that you are in a large airport.
"a small, un-pretentious italian restaurant in heemstede serving tasty italian food for a very good price. the surroundings are modest but the food is very good. service is very friendly."
"more than passable italian food with a dutch-touch (this is holland so manage your expectations!). pizzas are reasonable (not really what you would get in italy), and the rest of the menu offers a good choice. decent wine choice. very polite servi "
"this is a great restaurant for people who love pizza and pasta.  the pizzas were great, and you just had to finish all of it.  i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
"this was a great restaurant near where we stayed.  there was very friendly service and great food.  we were seated right next to the pizza oven, and got to watch our pizza get made."
nice and cozy place. on the main street of heemstede. fine ambiance and very good service. ideal place to meet with friends.
"my wife realy enjoys this italian restaurant, it is child friendly and the staff is very helpful. there is also an older italian man which is really focusing on details and customer experience so all with all this is our favorite restaurant near our home!"
"weve been to la via numerous times and have always enjoyed our meal.  homemade, tasty, and at a very reasonable price.  the service is very good and their menu selections are many."
"i was there on business dinner. menu is real great, but without english translation. so some of meals you have to guess as the waitress also didnt speak english. anyway nothing to claim about food, it was fresh, wonderful scallops and real well made ravioli. i think it is right place for family dinner , but fits also for business lunch or dinner. parking is possible on the street free after 6pm."
"i take out every other week and love their pizzas! my wife always takes the parmigiana. when eating in, the pastas (gorgonzola) saltinbocca and salmone diavola are my favorite. limoncello as dessert. :)"
"i have been here a few times over the last 4 years and it hasnt changed much. the menu is authentic, the bruschetta is awesome and so is the melanzane parmiagiana. the pizza and other pasta offerings have also been appreciated by my companions in the past ( i have been here with real italians and they liked i "
this restaurant was a real surprise to  
"it is not every day that you find such a good place! the food was unbelievably fresh, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the takeaway looked so delicious that i had to try it and i am glad i did! its fantastic!!! will definitely visit again. "
"the pasta box is part restaurant, part delicatessen. the front of the restaurant serves as a delicatessen where people are able to buy take-away fresh italian food. the same delicatessen also supplies food to the restaurant if and when required. the restaurant has a very good cook who prepares fresh italian food to order. the menu changes monthly. we had broccoli & gorgonzola soup, sea bass with fresh pasta, a vegetarian spaghetti dish, chocolate cake & a cheese platter. the pasta was very fresh & the fish very nice - the chocolate cake was moist and excellent. there is a varied wine list with some wines available by the glass. i had a very nice montepulciano dabruzzo & a sangiovese/merlot combination which was very pleasant & went very well with the food. a restaurant to recommend & to return in the near future."
"tony has been a masterchef for decades now, and it shows: terrific wine, a thoughtful crew and above all an excellent menu filled with the best culinary ideas. a visit to the pasta box is one to remember, and highly recommended!"
a lunch at the pasta box whether it be with a friend or with a large group is  a culinary pleasure. it is not a stiff formal restaurant but a friendly local restaurant to which one is happy to return to.
it is a nice dinner but i found it a bit expensive. nice service and environment. i recommend it for dinner
i visited here with family amd friends in october and have to say we enjoyed a wonderful meal and a very warm welco 
"we were here for a cappucino, which was excellent, and decided to have antipasto della casa. very nice too. it appears they also have a restaurant that we will try out next time."
we have gotten takeout from here a few times. always fresh and delicous tasting varieties indeed. one of our favourite spots in heemstede
"tony and his chefs prepare tasty, italian based dishes. nice spot for lunch and dinner, but i use it mostly as trattoria (take-out). good dishes and great desserts."
"everything around pasta is here available!!  excellent qualify, fantastic choice, well prepared and.... nice atmosphere !"
"what a nice surprise to eat here! i thought you can only have lunch in de pasta box, but you can also have dinner there. there are nice tables located in the rear, and me and my friends had a delicious dinner last thursday. we also took food for the following day, that was excellent. i surely go again! "
i love this place ! it is a shop selling all kinds of italian goodies..and you can eat there as well ! im a big fan of their salads but also the rest of their menu is worth while. great place to have in heemstede !
the owner who is also the chef works on his own and can handle about 20 guests. the food is very good and tasteful.
"even though we were delayed we received a warm welcome. the setting is wonderful with tables in a spacious shop. house white and red are good. we started with a salad with artichoke hearts, olives and tomatoes and a well-balanced dressing followed by saltimbocca. the latter included excellent quality veal expertly cooked. lovely experience. first-class ingredients professionally cooked and smiling service!"
"the restaurant is the continuation of restaurant delizia and is an asset for heemstede. i had a business lunch yesterday and had an excellent pasta with grilled veggies. it is less formal, and the prices and very reasonable. make sure to reserve a table as there are not many tables and all were occupied. and thats a good sign. pleasant and friendly sta "
"unexpected restaurant at the back of a delicatessen in heemstede. we were curious and gave it a try and were pleasantly surprised. three courses for 23,50‚Ç¨. we had a very good carpaccio, saltimbocca, tiramisu (spectacularly good - judged by my italian girlfriend..), home made by the chef/ owner. very good price / quality; we will definitely go back."
"this started off as a lunch restaurant ,+ take home italian prepared food,+sale of some typical italian delectables. recently, summer 2014, de pasta box has opened its doors for dinners 6 nights a week. it has a non complicated attractive italian choice of dishes and cooked by tony it cannot go wrong. there is a wonderful lemon cheese cake ,not to be beaten. an enjoyable venue with a relaxed ambiance and not over the top with prices."
"under the dutch intelligent lock down rules, it is still possible to take away an ice cream at toscana. there is a separated entry and exit enabling one way traffic, and there are indicators on the floor to keep the required 1.5 meters distance. the ice cream itself is still fantastic as before!"
great ice cream and also possible to get ice cream in cones that are gluten free.  great tasting ice cream!
large shop with a lot of different flavors. my personal favorite: limone- basilicum. wish they sold it in more ice creamshops!   would recommend the place and it is a nice spot to take a rest and watch people.
this place is opposite the drents museum ansd has the largest choice of ice-tasts i have ever met. sit inside or outside and enjoy your choice of icecream. it will not be easy to make your final choice. good luck. recommended!.
toscana is a new italian icecream parlor in assen on the brink. it serves a wide variety of icecream tastes and has a great terrace to sit outside and eat the icecream in the sunshine. we really enjoyed our icecreams here!
the carbonara made by the owner was hands down one of the best i have tried! full of flavour. friendly and professional service. reasonable prices.
"we went to bella italia on a friday evening. early june, so, a bit chilly, but the terrace it was. the atmosphere was buzzing, the sharing starter and wine great, the pizza decent and the desserts lovely. a very nice evening out in the centre of assen."
"lovely italian restsurant. service is very friendly. fresh ingredients, lovely italian tastes. wines available by glass."
"delicious italian meals. terrace is big and busy, if you like it quiet you need to go indoors. dinner portions are good, but desserts are huge! service was good as well."
"excellent pasta, great service. recommend a visit.. decent beer menu, house wine was average however."
"beautiful restaurant, absolutely divine food and the portion sizes were amazing! the meal and wine were something i would love to repeat, truly lovely.  the service was friendly and quick.  great restaturant."
"the worlds best pizza, crispy from edge to middle, fresh ingredients - simply delicious! the dessert was excellent and the red wine was great! 5 stars are more than deserved."
"we often stay in assen but had never visited this restaurant.  now we know what they do, we will return when we are in the region again.  good portions of very tasty food.  the sharing starter looked lovely and all was very fresh."
whilst we were in assen we were taken to this restaurant the service was excellent and food food amazing prices can be a little more tha say run of the mill pizzas places but well worth it if your in assen its a must
"atmosphere was great from the start - busy and happy with good ambiance, english menu was welcome and pizzas were truly delicious. would recommend highly. thank you everyone!"
this is a beautiful restaurant. they have a lot of space so i think its suitable for big groups of people. you can sit indoors and out and the menu has lots of different things to choose from. staff is very friendly and notices when you want to ask something. they are very polite and humble and prices are about right. its not the cheapest but you can tell they really put effort into their meals and how they present them.
"there are lots of italian restaurants but only a few are really great at combining good food, a bustling warm friendly atmosphere and good serving staff. add reasonable pricing, inside and outside dining and bella italia scores on every account. pizza and pasta of all types with real taste and desserts to die for.. see photo of the mixed desert selection plate. worth planning a visit if you are on holiday in the area ( the locals are there already)."
"first of all: make reservations; always very busy. you can sit inside the restaurant (very noisy), but theres also a heated terrace outside.  quality of food is very good, staff very nice."
we came here to have a nice dinner and a chat. apart from the rainy weather there were absolutely nothing to complain abou 
"in the citycentre of assen this nice italian restaurant is located with both regular and terras seating opportunities. the resataurant offers a nice choice of italian dishes. we only ordered pizzas, which were of one of the best qualities we ever had (including restaurants in italy "
"good house wine and tasty food. busy but really nice. for two pizzas and one pasta and a bottel of rose, i paid ‚Ç¨53. good value for your money."
"food good, service excellent. the only down side tables very close to one another. had to wait quite a while to be served and long wait for food to arrive. it was a busy saturday night though"
"we had a very nice dinner here recently. the place is popular...for a reason....good italian food at reasonable prices. it has a busy, but pleasant, atmosphere."
we had a lovely appetizer and meal.  there are many unique pizzas available.  the staff were helpful and spoke english well.
"this restaurant has very extensive menu with something to suit all. delicious italian food served in a pleasant outdoor area. good service, staff very pleasant and helpful. offered alternative seats when the person next to us started to smoke. efficient but given time to relax and enjoy the very tasty meal. definitely worth a visit. "
"we ate here at about 6pm on a tuesday night expecting it to be quiet and it was absolutely packed! luckily we were able to be seated on a table for 2 right by the window. we ordered carpaccio and olives to start. carpaccio was lovely but could have done with slightly more dressing. for mains i had a steak dish with balsamic and my husband had a pork dish with mushrooms. we both enjoyed them, though my husband felt his dish had far too much sauce and would have been served in a side jug. but thats personal preference. the atmosphere felt like an authentic italian and the service was very good. we will be returning."
"we ate here, my husband had pizza & i had the lasagne it was delicious. we sat outside, all the tables had patio heaters & blanket were provide for you legs such a nice touch"
"pizzas are very good. if you are not very hungry, you can order  one pizza for 2. they also have a nice choice of wines."
allways very busy so dont forget to make a reservation. lovely environment and good hospitality. also very nice food!!
"we had a delicious pizza, sitting outside on a summer evening. the restaurant was busy as it was sunday after the motorcycle races, but the staff was friendly and helpful and the pizza as good as in italy. we shared the pizza and a large garden salad, with beer..pure heaven!"
"we have been here on several occasions. for starters we always take the bread & garlic butter. delicious main courses, especially the scallopa and pizzas. the kids really liked the desser "
"weve been coming here pretty regularly since our friends introduced us to it. the place is always packed, even on monday nights, but even so, service is quick and friendly. the pizzas are great, with generous amounts of toppings but the place serves more than that. pastas and meat dishes are just as good and the portions are gigantic, you won‚Äôt go hungry here. save some space for the desserts though, they are very tasty indeed and considerably better than anything served at your ‚Äòregular‚Äô italian restaurant."
if you ever have the pleasure of visiting assen then i really recommend this restaurant . as soon as you walk in you are greeted with delicious smells and a warm welcome 
"the bella italia is a fairly large italian restaurant on the market square opposite de nieuwe kolk in assen. apart from pizzas they serve a fairly large menu of italian food, including fish and meat dishes. despite being quite full on a thursday evening the service was quick, food arrived quickly enough as well. red house wine was delicious and a large glass full and came with a generous bread basket with garlic butter. tap water came at no additional cos "
"hubby ordered a pizza capricciosa , while i had the spaghetti bella italia and they were excellent. the only downside was that our appetizers were forgotten and i had to call back our waitress to remind her. what was annoying was that she kept passing our table already and simply didnt remember we were supposed to have appetize "
"since i live in italy, finding a good pizzeria in the netherlands is not always easy. usually, i try to avoid any pizzeria here, but i came here with a group of colleagues, so basically had to. i must say i was pleasantly surprised! i went for a simple napoletana, and the ingredients on the pizza are fresh, which is a good sign, and also the dough was of good quality. this was also the case on the pizzas of my colleagues even the frutti di mare with fish. also, it was a thursday before christmas and the place was packed, so apparently a popular restaurant. if youre in assen and youre looking for a good pizza, i would recommend this place."
eat here when we come over to assen for the bsb and world superbikes food always excellent staff always friendly and helpful explaining the menu in english to us highly recommend a visit from tom and eve
"a group of us called in late on saturday evening, we were warmly welcomed and shown to our table. we ordered 2 starters of mixed cheese and meat with fresh warm bread and 2 large spicy pizza topped with cheese salami and chillies. they were delicious fresh and piping hot, all washed down with cold lager. the staff were very helpful and friendly."
"i am a vegan ,also my family is vegan or vegetarian. this is no problem in this restaurant, you can change the ingredients of the pizza. you can also change the ingredients of the pasta. there is a lot of choise of pizzas en other food."
"great meal, great service. but what was very surprising, after dinner i had a cappuccino but went outside for a cigarette.  the moment i came back they replaced the old cappuccino with a new one. thats what i call service!"
there¬¥s a lot of choice and good food here. you can sit in- and outside. the personnel is friendly. it is possible to sit a while and talk after you are finished eating your food :)
we had a meal at this restaurant two night in a row as food was great. service great and friendly staff. pizza and pasta fab also mixed grill. 5 had different meals and all great thanks.
pizza and steaks very good.  located in a nice square and lots of seats outside with heaters.  staff were friendly efficient and do not rush you.  very relaxing meal
"we ate here during the tt festival so it was absolutely packed! they had a special menu for the few nights that the festival was on for. i had the spaghetti carbonara and the portion was absolutely huge, i barely made a dent in it. it was very tasty however. my husband had the pizza which looked good too. the service was good despite how busy they were and we are looking forward to eating here again on a normal evening."
nice and cozy place. excellent food with quality ingredients. will make this my favorite italian place in assen!
i live in assen and i love going there. everytime i suggest isolabella. its great to sit outside and also possible almost the whole year because of their warmingsystem. not only the food and the prices are good but also the service is wonderful!
"i had to get the barstaff in the bar to translate the menu for me and was astounded to find around 100 pizzas offered! i opted to talk to the staff to arrive at a favourite and they were helpful, polite and good humoured. good service and a good pizza. well done!"
lovely atmosphere - real buzz and very good italian food.  always go there when we visit my daughter and family in assen.  lovely staff too.
"a very popular and busy pizzaria in assen, large selection and very good quality. service is good, and prices very reasonable. can be busy so check the availability of tables"
"nice place and very friendly people, good service and good food . there english is good so no problem , that help a lot. we were there with some friends and it was a great evening."
love the dutch cheeses flavoring great italian foods.  the lasagna was fabulous! the pizzas looked good too.
"nice coffee, nice pastries & lunches. good service & very good location. definitely would drop back in here again when in the area."
"excellent coffee choices, very friendly service, good light lunch options. assen is a small town with lots of shops, easy stop when you are cycling drenthe. interesting museum, very worthwile!"
"the food was amazing. finally, an authentic italian restaurant. the service was also on fleek. coming back here for sure"
"a great restaurant, excellent food. superb gluten free dishes! the owner, luca, is a great person whom you can feel that he loves his restaurant and enjoys the satisfaction of the customers. super recommended !!"
had dinner with friends / colleagues at da paolo. great location across the zoo and in a shopping mall. food was alright. not your standard pizzeria. they have more dishes including meat and fish. it was quite busy this thursday evening. the setting is great for a family dinner or when dining out with friends. service was friendly. food was ok to good. we asked for some extra peperoncino but they either forgot about it or put paprika on instead. pizza was good tasting. risotto very delicious t 
"fine place. great pasta. great starters.  pizza, calzone, pasta. but don‚Äôt expect spaghetti and meatballs. the dishes are better than that.  good wines.  great service.  you‚Äôd swear you were in a real italian restaurant.  enjoy!!"
we went there with a group of business people and ordered different starters. all were excellent and especially the pizza bread they serve in the beginning is wonderful. the pizzas and pasta afterwards were great as well.
"su sardu real italian food. very good beef, very good pasta home made.im italian and i suggest this restaurant."
"i visited this lovely restaurant with an italian colleague while in emmen on business and he was so enthusiastic about it that we returned 3 times.the pasta was freshly made and delicious and the pizza thin, crispy and equally good. i also had a very good fish dish. the owner and staff are extremely friendly."
a gem of a restaurant in central emmen. very friendly service and most delicious food - half full on a tuesday evening. grazie!
"we turned up as a party of 19 (8 adults and 11 children aged between 3-16) with no reservations after a day at the local wild life park (zoo). we were made to feel welcome by the staff and found a group of tables. service was quick, with drinks being ordered and delivered very quickl "
"i went to to eat here with my friend, and we ordered the valentines menu. the starters were great, we got a little bit of everything. the main was okay, the chicken and pasta were so-so to me. the desert was good. the red wine we had was deliciou "
"it was very late hours, restaurant was open and they ready to service. we ate italian vegetarian pizza, it was delicious (may be we were very hungry, lol)"
"there are restaurants that you know are good and you should visit more often but somehow you just dont. su sardu is one of those places. it must have been at least 5 years since i last visited this establishment, or maybe even more. back then there was another owner and i remember the food was fantastic. its not that it is a long drive, its right in the middle of the city and i must pass it at least 20 times a year, but somehow when we go out for a bite su sardu is not the first thing on our mind. perhaps its because its italian and the first thing you think about with that is pizza, but su sardu is so much more then this. we visited the place with our friends as a farewell dinner before they went off again to australia. admitting it was not our first choice, i was happy that we ended up here. although the interior is a bit to modern/cold to my taste, the service and food more then makes up for it. we chose the combinazione completa and had several starters each well prepared and very tasty. as a main i had the rack of lamb after the ( friendly and professional ) waitress ensured me that it was very good. and she was right !. the fresh pasta served with the dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned with pesto. after all this i could not resist the wonderful torta al mango as a dessert. the whole evening was as it should be, good friends, good food, good service.. it will definitely not be another 5 years before i return !"
"nice place, good food , one place to come back. centrum area of the city, just in the begining .  perfect place to walk and see a lot of shops there .."
"as su sardu has changed owner also the restaurant changed to the better, a good lunch menu and good dinner menu. nice and friendly staff, good chefs in the kitchen. when you want a great evening ask the staff not for the menu, but ask them for the specials of chef with either a wine arragement"
"while on business we ate here.  service was great and all english speakers.  the decor is moder. with large log fire, great on winters night.  big menu and well presented. flavours clean and not too heavy.  great value"
"nice waiters, extensive menu (ask for english menu), and good food with large portions. unfortunately, it was difficult to communicate with the staff, which is understandable as this is a smaller town. huge problems at payout though as we discovered that they only take maestro cards, not even visa or mastercard. this seems to be relatively normal for the area, but worth mentioning to visitors."
"on our last night in the area, and being a monday, where many of the shops and restaurants are closed, it was a relief to find a good pizzeria open. the decor is immaculate and the staff friendly and helpful - we don‚Äôt speak dutch, so it was great to get a little help from the waitres "
we had great dinner with 3 famil 
nice restaurant with good food and good service. the tables are not too close to each other so that is nice. the maincourse (salmon) i expected to be more with vegetables.  but nevertheless it was still good prepared.
"great place and highly recommended !!!!  on arrival we thought we were wrong because the location is in the heart of a residential neighborhood.  we ate the pizza of the place and it was excellent, the atmosphere amazing and the service pleasant"
"travelling in flevoland we found this restaurant. nearby parking, nice interior, comfortable seating and a cosy fire burni "
"spending time together when you have two kids becomes rare. so when the opportunity came by to have dinner together we decided to go for this romantic restaurant. the ambience is great, romantic with the fireplace. the staff is really friendly and helpful. the food was great, the meals looked great and tasted really good. if youre looking for a nice place to eat in lovely lelystad, go to sorrento!"
"arrived without reservation, however patrick the manager organised a table, while we had a nice wine at the bar. service was very good and the food even better. price was very reasonable for what we had. well worth a visit!"
"enough to choose from for your diner, including traditional dishes and more creative options. accompanied with perfect wines, especially the red wines. let them pour one into their perfect karaf, and enjoy!"
we arrived around 7.30pm on a sunday without a reservation. a party of 9 on our bikes after cycling close to 90 miles that day feeling very tired and hungry. although we were still in our cycling gear we were made to feel very welcome by nando with the fire roaring and a lovely relaxing atmosphe 
"we had, again, a great dinner last night at sorrento. the setting comfortable for families and couples. the food is great and the have very nice wines. enjoy an italian style diner at sorrentos."
"the atmosphere is nice. good italian food. me and my family have been going here for the last 15 years. we all have our favorites. great pasta, pizzas and wine. if you dont want to go out you can order in and they do deliver."
"nice italian food, in a suprisingly nice entourage. especially the pizzas are very nice. also the possibility to order in."
italian - menu good but once visited a few times you know what your favorites are! quality good and constant. wine menu go 
"we ordered the #53 (championages speciale), pepperoni en cheese and a meat pizza. we all enjoyed our pizza, delivery was a bit delayed which took an hour and 15 minutes. warning!! if you have olives in your pizzas, the stones are still inside, just be aware so you don‚Äôt damage your teeth."
"although first appearances aren‚Äôt so impressive- a long dark wooden furnished dining room-the courtyard, under a lush vine, complete with grapes, is a lovely relaxing place to eat great pizza. 100+ varieties- all on a thinnish deep-pan base. just like so many good independent pizza places from the 70s and 80s, before phut and pizza e came along. prices are a real bonus- much lower than main street places. oh, and although the desserts are great (a huge bowl of strawberries, ic and cream for ‚Ç¨3.50?!!!) it‚Äôs next door to what seems to be the most popular ice cream parlour in holland- long qs at 9.30 on a sunday evening? "
"excellent service, we tried many flavors all were excellent.  the pear, melon, pistachio, vanilla all  were good.  the shop had few seats in front of the store"
"first time in the area we googled italian restaurants/takeaway and this place scored well. attended for a takeaway and we were not disappointed with the quality and quantity of the food. the bruschetta was clearly freshly made and delicious as was the salmond spaghetti and the penne carbonara. my only disappointment, we were charged the full restaurant price for a takeaway, or it would have been a 5 star review. i‚Äôm not sure if this is common in holland, but it certainly is not back in scotland. that said, we will most definitely return there to ‚Äúsit in‚Äù during our stay. the restaurant has a very authentic italian feel to it."
many pizzas on  the menu (normal and napolitana). one minus on quality control: the pizza pepperoni was made with ham in stead of salami/pepperoni
"do not let the unassuming outside of this restaurant fool you.  inside you will find an incredibly charming restaurant.  the food and wine were great, the staff was very kind and attentive, and the bruschetta was some of the best i‚Äôve ever had."
"great options for topic on pizzas. nice venue, good location. almost every time i visited leeuwarden, this was the pizzeria to go to."
"it makes you feel like being in italy and the food is the best in town. i have not been to such a good italian in a long time.staff, music, food, wine everything just fits. i have been several times and service has been performing well every time even when busy. if i come back to the netherlands i would go to leeuwarden just for that one!"
"very attentive and friendly staff, good food and they have big portions. they also have a couple of menus in english even!"
we had a great dinner. pizza selection is very good. no disappointment at this restaurant. everyone was delighted with the service. coffee was a fine ending to a good value and great food.
"quality of pizza and ingredients were high! service was good, but had to wait a while, but i wasnt in a hurry and i had a beer to drink, so i was in no worry mode. the afternoon was warm, so the dining room was also a bit on the warm side. not a big deal, i would definitely go back for more!"
"we had pizza dinner in pompei leeuwarden with a bunch of students and eachers (altogether 25 pax) . student pizzas were simple but inexpensive - from menu i chose pizza with spenach, tomato and atichoke. that was really delicious - not too big, very good dough and tasty filling. i recommend."
"we had dinner at this place with a rather big group. at first glance you would say that the restaurant is rather small, but once inside, you will notice that they do have a lot a space on different floo "
"for more than 30 years we come to this restaurant! and every time again we have a great pizza. lots of choice, lots of flavours, lots of taste, every time again! so.....if you visit leeuwarden and looking for a great meal: go to pompei!!"
"my experience here was great. i came here alone. even so, i was accepted to take a seat at one of their tables. took tagliatelle with chicken and a glass of white wine. service was great, food excellent, people were friendly."
was looking for a place to grab some food and spotted this italian place. so decided to grab a pizza and glad of wine.  the combination was good. the pizza was very tasty. too bad i had to leave leeuwarden the next day .
we stopped by here one morning for a few beers and looked at the menu for dinner optio 
"pleasant spot on a square, well patronised by locals, enormous drinks menu, so if you are into gin or cocktails definitely a place to visit. some good drinkable wines at reasonable prices, and the same for the food. italian biased but other choices too, food equally enjoyable at sensible prices. tip try the cheese board plank to go with drinks. note this restaurant only accepts credit cards in payment!!"
i recently visited the fellini city lounge with a large group of friends ( 36) the staff catered well with the large number of customers. the food was delicious and well presented. the drinks menu was also good. all 36 left having enjoyed good food and an enjoyable experience.
simple menu but super tasty food. service very friendly and quick. good relaxed vibe for a city centre lunch.
"nice service, could speak perfect english and had english menus as well. ordered tea which had a wide variety of flavours and the club sandwich which was huge and the ingredients tasted lovely and fresh. would go there again for sure"
went here with a large group of people. still they managed to give us a nice choice of food and service. have an allergy? no problem! even tho its not originally in the set menu they still managed to help out and create a stunning replacement.
this is a very good italian restaurant. the staff were helpful efficient and friendly. the menus was good and the food was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend a visit.
nice atmosphere familie feeling in combination with good food and normalprices close by museum and parking
been here with friends in a raining day of summer. we sit outside anyway and we have great time. the food was really good and the service good also. i will come back for sure.
after visiting the fries museum we went here for an early dinne 
before going to a concert we decided to have dinner close  
"this is a pleasant place with generous portions and cheerful staff. the restaurant is relatively centrally located in a town of very walkable size, and the frisian museum is just next door."
we needed a hand with some of the translation of the menu and the waiter was fabulous. he wasnt sure of a couple of the words so he came back in seconds with his i pad with google translate on it. what service. we had a superb meal too. cant fault the place at all.
"for some reason this place has a low reputation among reviews, but i think totally undeserved. the pizza is the tastiest in leeuwarden, and its a nice place to go out to eat."
very good pizzas and good service. we ordered our pizzas on the phone and they were ready on due time. the quality is very good for pizzas that are not that expensive.
"apparently these guys just won the best pizza of leeuwarden competition! well, i couldnt agree more! very cozy place, with a lot of great italian dishes on the menu"
"we wanted to order a bottle of whine and we got an excellent recommendation, so ask them about it! the pizzas had a true italian flat crust. we had an amazing dinner, partially due to the lovely waitress."
"lovely atmosphere, had to wait a tad for my food because they were baking it fresh but it was soooo worth it. ordered the lasagna with mozzarella and it was one of the best dishes ive had in my life, my friends both ordered a pizza each and both were really satisfied, would recommend without a doubt "
known mostly by the locals this italian restaurant is one of the hidden gems the city has to off 
"if you want to go for a good pizza and dont want to spend too much, this is the place to go! the pizza is a good size and often the food is ready in no time!"
"made an unplanned stop for pizza.  pizza was authentic italian, a was the wine and service. will be back"
"called in on the off chance for lunch while out visiting places nearby. beautiful place with good views, outdoor seating and a spacious indoor restaurant. friendly staff were very helpful and served food and drink from a varied menu. the quality of both the food and drinks were excellent."
"feel like having italian style pizza? de burgemeester van naples is a place to go in leeuwarden. in the past they served calzone with nutella and mascarpone, too bad that is now off their menu."
"very delicious cuisine, super friendly staff, very nice service offered. lovely atmosphere. definitely recommended!"
"due to covid-19 the restaurant was closed. but the restaurant offered the possibility to order the majority of the menu online. we ordered as appetizer taglieri delle casa and as main course pizza prosicuto and pizza salami picante. the order was delivered at almost the split second and was of high quality and good temperature. it was our first time ordening online and it won‚Äôt be our last, a good experience."
"i am in leeuwarden for work and visited for some authentic pizza and was not disappointed. i ordered the house special, pizza de burgmeester van naples. it was thin crust, napoli way, and had a great balance of meat and cheese. it‚Äôs always nice to sit outside, enjoy the breeze, and drink a peroni with good pizza."
this is getting to be the same for every place in leeuwarden that we have been to good food good beer good service.  i wish every restaurant was like it
hello we come every year to the mayor of naples and every time it is super nice food and top pizza and pasta and super nice staff and nice kitchen staff and wait staff who takes time for our son who would like a photo of the oven where he is at and quite where other companies can take an example so much patience until next year thanks for everything family johan
"came here on a bit of a whim as we were in leeuwarden for the night and both really craved pizza. its quite a large restaurant with seating inside and out. the layout and the furnishings turn what could be a large, chaotic space into something quite cozy and intimate. we both ordered pizzas and drinks, in the case of my partner a surprisingly good 5 euro negroni! the pizza was excellent, great crust, fluffy on the inside and just a little crispy on the outside. i always feel a little apprehensive ordering pizza in a restaurant because the quality can very so wildly but i reckon they pretty much nailed it. the toppings were nice and there were plenty of them, but i kind of felt like they were overshadowed by the dough and the sauce. excellent service to boot. no reservations about coming back here whatsoever."
"we had a party of six and every person loved their meal! we had pizza, calzones, lasagna, and pasta and it was all delicious. don‚Äôt pass up the gelato at the end either! our favorites were the white chocolate and lemo "
"as italian living in friesland for one year already, i often miss the taste of the real pizza that is unfortunately not so easy to find around here. but finally there it was, delicious and perfect pizza üòç the service was very nice and fast, the atmosphere is also cute. the prices of course are way higher than the italian average but don‚Äôt forget we are in the netherlands ü§ó the menu looked great and we will definitely come back some other time to try some pasta as well. we also had desserts, everything very good. can‚Äôt wait for the next visit ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"we were lucky to find a large table in the shade which allowed us to chat and people watch at the same time. the service was fabulous with attentive servers, and the food was fresh and tasty. it is in a great location and i would recommend a visit."
had a great dinner here after a long day of traveling. the pizzas are very good and big enough for a full meal. we also had some tasty wine. it was nice to look out the window at the city center and people watch here. they also have a wonderful ambiance!
we had a very nice meal at de burgemeester van naples recently. the staff were very good and the restaurant had a fantastic atmosphere. the food on offer was typical italian fare. i had a pasta and jumbo prawn dish which was delicious. the restaurant also has a very good drinks menu- the aperol spritz was just perfect. i would highly recommend a visit.
had a lovely plate with bread and homemade dips and olives before we went home for dinner. it was great and very tasty. would visit again for dinner. great atmosphere and employees were very friendly!
i had lunch here today. they served really great piadina: fresh ingredients! the service was fast and the place gives good vibes. if you are in leeuwarden i would recommend this place.
"i am quite picky with pizza.. but i have to admit that the one i had in de burgemeester van napels was one of the best i had in the netherlands. the restaurant has a wood fired pizza oven, which is not that common here. the only downside is that pizza is served only for dinner."
"the pizzeria de burgemeester van napels‚Äù, in leeuwarden has been a magnificent discovery. as italian and especially as neapolitan living in the netherlands since more than 16 years, i can say that i never have eat a better pizza! for taste and quality this has been the pizza that come more close to what i normally eat in napl "
"i have bent there twice, and it is really good. as we heard, this was newly opened in leeuwarden (in that time), it is nicely decorated and a big restaurant in italian style. they mostly serve pizza, and some pasta. pizza is really, but like really good. although not so big, but that can be decieving. i thought at first, oh my good, this is so small, but at the end (with two beers :)) it was quite enough for a dinner. staff is great, only downside is that they have a small menu, but at the end maybe they wouldnt have that kind of quality in food."
"the restaurant serves a variety of italian food, but we went simply for the pizza. the toppings offered are creative, we enjoyed our pizzas, although we did find them quite salty."
very good friendly people..excelent food very tasty! i loved also the wineof the house and desserts.
"we had dinner here with our friends, who had recommanded this restaurant. we had baguette with 3 different toppings as an entree and they were nice. the main meal was excellent. we had the beef fillet and it was very tasty and very tender. our friends had the osso buco and that was very good as well. we shared a tiramisu and that was okay. we were seated outside as weather was beautiful and it was very pleasant. the service was very friendly. "
its a good place where to find very good italian food in friesland. the owner give attention to the quality of the food and he has a lot of wine choice. if you like grappa as well he as a huge list of wonderful one
"best pizza in friesland, delicious meat dishes, super variety of pasta dishes, great selection of wines, lovely smiles!! we go once a month!"
good italian restaurant cooked by genuine italian people from corsi 
"we went by a recommendation at tripadvisor, the service was great, the portions were big and very tasty. we had a selection of pizzas and pasta and everything was wonderful"
"we had pizza at il nuraghe an it was delicius. i counted 67 different pizzas an a lot of other nice food. if you look for a good menu for a good price, this is the place to go."
the italian serra family knows how to bake a pizz 
"came here to study & could stay all day up into the late evening, which is great because coming from the us everything else in this city closes at 5 pm! prices are the slightest bit high but everything tastes so good and fresh!"
"are you a tourist visiting t loo palace or are you in apeldoorn for another reason, book a table at klein berlijn. you will not regret it! this little gem is a type of kitchen, healthy, personal, great design interior, very tasty and beautifully shaped dishes, absolutely great cook, that would be fully booked every evening, should it be situated in a town like amsterdam, rotterdam or utrecht. but it is not, so one of the two floors was full on the friday evening that we were there. good for us, not good for the restaurant. i think that arno (i dont know him, only know his name from the waiter), deserves all the support he can get, because of his courage to open up a restaurant like this in the, food wise, conservative town of apeldoorn. we had a light dinner with a great salmon sashimi, a very tasty paella and a great fish of the day. all colorful dishes, very tasty, with good ingredients. even the coffee was very good. we will be back. hopefully we will meet you there :). no remarks at all? well, yeah, one. time between dishes was too long. should be about a quarter of an hour less. make sure you have enough to discuss ;)"
"i am from hague, hut i love to come and chill down here. its such an cool place and veey hipster and berlini looking, also they have lots of vegan diahes and the atmosphere is just cozy and cool and go with the flow. very nice that sich places excists actually in apeldoorn!"
"biological restaurant. a lot of place and several floors. the upper floor is more cozy. the food was good. the first course was special, the second more ordinary and the last course (browny) was not very special. friendly service."
this restaurant has a lot to offer. the building is very interesting. the decoration is very interesting as well. look at the pictures and judge for yourself. very friendly staff. we liked the lunch food (warm sandwiches) and tea/coffee we had. we would come back and order the same thing. that is a good sign. minor points: the mens bathroom could use some tlc and it is positive that the neighborhood is still in development.
a really nice evening with excellent service from staff ! pasta choices were delicious and a lot üòÄ combination with offered wine- great way to go !
"we have tried the lasagna, the so called italian burger with fries coated with parmesan and spaghetti carbonara. everything was very good, good portions. sat outside at the small tables right on the sidewalk- quite nic "
"had the pleasure of hosting a group dinner for twelve. during phone calls to make and confirm the reservation, the older lady on the other end of the phone was rude, abrupt and threatened that if we did not show up exactly on time, we would lose our reservation. nothing like a good threat to start the night out righ "
"we loved it!  wonderfull staff and a very tasty food in a good price, thank you :) we ate soup and pizza and we loved it it is also very clean."
an excellent place with an italian atmosphere.   true italian place the pizza and the pasta were delicious!!   thank you
best pizzas in town. run by a nice italian women who makes you feel welcome every time. the pizza choices are endless. and they taste delicious. it never takes more than 20 minutes for your pizza to arrive. i highly recommend this cosy pizzeria.
and the personnel is very nice!/ service is great - they do their best to let you feel at home. the food is of good quality for a reasonable price.
"very tasty and well made pizza in apeldoorn. the menu is extremely diverse to the point its difficult to choose something so im sure theres something available for any taste no matter how demanding. friendly staff, nice atmosphere and fast service. one thing to take into consideration though - they do not accept credit cards so if youre from overseas cash is your only payment option."
"obviously a very popular local restaurant as we couldnt get in on saturday so went again on sunday night. i had an excellent mixed seafood pizza (salmon, prawn, artichoke hearts etc) definitely 5* although my husbands was more average but acceptable. very short wine list - chianti or lambrusco- so we went for a carafe of house rose which was just fine"
"we visit this pizzeria several times a year, and always enjoy our meals her "
the pizza was amazing. service excellent and hosts friendly.
i went here for pizza and the quality of the pizza was very good. expect to pay around 10 euros for a pizza. service is friendly and efficient. the restaurant itself is a bit small and they put quite a lof of tables inside.. so when its full it might feel a bit overcrowded. would definatly go back here again for pizza one day.
"da vinci is my go-to restaurant when i am in this city! amazing food, attentive waiters, welcoming atmosphere, and the cutest set up! you really feel cared for in this place, which is unusual for dutch restaurants/ hospitality (üôÑ). the menu is amazing and they pay attention to any changes or addition you would like to your food! 100% coming back! they have a loyal customer now."
"we had no reservation on this saturday but the italian owner was so nice to give us a nice table for two. we start sharing three starters vittela tonato, bresaola and cozze. we enjoy our starters very much. the food was prepared wel "
"ideal place to have a nice italian meal.we were three and we had a tagliatelle with salmon,a pizza crudo and a pizza quatro stagioni plus two primi pasti shared with a bottle of excellent white vermintino wine,all for the price of 99 euro.we were served by two very friendly ladies who seemed to love their jobs.a place to come back to."
"i visited this place and had a delicious pizza. italian style pizza, not americ "
"we just wanted to find a place for dinner, and we were surprised by the quality. it was good food, and the wine recommended really went well with the meal. a surprise find."
we had a big family group and the food was very good and the staff very nice. the dining area has enough cozy spots for couple dinning. keep in mind they have large portions.
"this small, narrow but very cozy italian place is near apeldoorn city center. the maestro comes from cagliari sardegna and prefers to speak only italian. as greeks and italians are una faccia, una raccia we had zero communicational problems. we had the typical italian first dishes (bruschetti/pomodorro, ruccola/parmiggiana) and as main dish we all got linguini ai fungi. everything was excellent. only the beer was dutch. we ordered and had a bit of everything from desserts (do try it, at least for once in a month you can do it). then came the maestro with his grapa di casa and that finished us once and for good that evening."
"took a group of 6 here for dinner. the place is very nice inside and the staff was accommodating by putting a few tables together. most tables inside are 4 or 2 people. we were lucky because it was not that busy so they could move things around. food was good and service was good...a bit slow by u.s. standards but you need to remember where you are. bottom line is a good place to eat, with very nice staff."
". cosy, intimate thing. very nice and courteous service, all at times seemed a bit too much for the boy guests only. the food was great! and that is pretty if you like meat, fish and vega ordered at one table (i speak from many bad experiences elsewhere). everything is delicious to taste and a little spicy, which even my great aunt could really appreciate. the pre mushrooms are for me a real winner! the tomato sauces at the mains were freshly prepared and you can taste it. try to decorate at least for 1 main course spaghetti with garlic and chillies i would eat it every day with love! the wine drinkers at the table (red, white and rose) were very satisfied, tasty good wine. the desert map i noticed something on, until our shared dessert arrived with everything. go for the tartufo or limoncelloijs;) deliciou "
"da vinci is one of the best italian restauraurants we know. been there in october with friends and had a great time. very nice menus with plate service, but we just asked to make something special. it was! thats for sure, we will back very soon."
"ive visited this italian restaurant several times because its probably the best pizzeria in town. ive also tried some of their other dishes, which were less impressive, so if you like pizza: go for  "
"the staff was really nice and the pizza was amazing! thin fluffy bottom, crispy edges, fresh sauce, not too salty or greasy. they also had some really good cocktails."
i ordered a pizza parma speciale. i think its the most delicious pizza ive ever eat 
"i am very much impressed with the food pibia serves! it is quite a large restaurant with a big menu to choose from, but everytime i went, everything i chose came out great. even the lasagne, which is usually disappointing in restaurants, was great! the service is also great, and the (house)wine is also good. if you want to eat italian food in apeldoorn i recommend you to go to pibia."
we met some nice people in apeldoorn at a bar and later we diced to have dinner togeth 
"friendly staff good pizzas, if we come back in apeldoorn we definitely will eat a pizza there. if you dont like big places with lots of people you shouldnt go there"
"when i say every time, i really mean every time. weve been here dozens of times and it always is the best pizza in town. they have sooo many pizzas to chose from, but they also serve other dishes. keep up the good work, and we will keep coming ba "
had a great night out with family enjoying well cooked pizza with quite acceptable glasses of house red wine. if you are chasing italian cuisine then a visit will not disappoint
ate here with a large group. the menu is large (70+ pizzas) but very interesting. the pizza came quickly and the service was reasonabl 
"found this to be much better than the other pizza place in town, sardegna. one minor annoyance, the staff are not terribly attentive, perhaps theyre overworked, but otherwise a good experience."
"after spending summer holidays in italy, the pizzas at pibia do not disappoint. they are absolutely deliciou "
very good quality for money. nice atmosphere. enough places where you can zit.  a lot of pizzas and pastas and all very delicious.
"this restaurant is excellent, the food is delicious- great pizza and pasta, the tiramisu desert is wonderful and the prices are fare for everyone. the service is also good. i recommend to visit in your next visit in the area"
"we are regular customers of this italian restaurant. we enjoy the pizza, pasta and 3-course menu very much."
"the most fantastic steak apeldoorn has to offer. even in corona times enzo, viera and their team provide the best food there is. thank you for making us feel at home when we have to stay at home!"
we went there few times during the week because of some events.  it was each time late (around 22h30 or even later). we were wamly welcome each time.   food are good and well served. i would recommend this place.
"waiters were very nice and accommodating. we were helped by at least three of the restaurants staff. the restaurant has a small dinning room and is very cozy. the food is good, nothing exceptional but you leave with a good feeling of great hospitality."
"the food is great, pizza and pasta. the bread with garlic butter is lovely and big portions, its well priced and in a prime spot. what can anyone complain abo "
good choice of pizza and the pizzas my son and i had were definitely above average. the restaurant has a good ambiance.
"we had excelent time, good real italian food .  the food was delicious, hot and arrived on time service courteous and friendly.  strongly recommend."
this italian is in the small centre of apeldoorn . good selection of pizza and pasta . family run not a chain . fair pricing ideal for relaxed family or friends meal . house wines not on the menu - you need to ask . would use again . no outdoor seating .
this was a delight. the food was very good (i had linguine vongole). the service was just right too.  the cost was reasonable too. recommended.
"this restaurant offers a cozy atmosphere and good pizzas and pastas. it is not super chic, rather unpretentious, suitable for families or friends. service is friendly and attentive. the decoration and music give you the ‚Äúitaly vibe‚Äù. prices are decent. location by the river is nice, we plan to come back sometime during summer when outside seating is possible. all in all, recommended."
a very nice place for bigger groups we had a dinner more 15 of us. service was very good and fast and the food was very good as well.
"my boyfriend and i had ordered pizza from here a few times and decided to actually go for our anniversary, and i cannot stress how much we enjoyed it here. the service was impeccable, the food was authentic and delicious, and the ambience was great. we went on a monday so it was naturally quiet, and you could tell the place is family run. everywhere was warm and cosy, the stone pizza oven within view. we were treated amazingly- coats taken off and hung at the door, complimentary bruschetta and bread, asked multiple times whether we needed anything else etc. we will definitely be returning, especially in the summer as it‚Äôs situated right on the riverfront. highly recommend!"
"part of seven visited early on the evning without a reservation but were soon seated together.excellent pizzas , i had the 4 seasons and was probably the best pizza outside of italy that i have had. whats more you could watch the chef at work by the pizza oven. good prices friendly staff and with a few more people in i think there would be a great ambience."
"we visited this restaurant for a family dinner. i am italian and i am always a bit skeptical to go in italian restaurant abroad. however this restaurant was a pleasant surprise. from what i understood it is managed from a sicilian family and you can taste it. the food is very good and the quality is high. we took 3 bruschettoni with stracciatella cheese, rucola and cherrytomato and one parmigiana as starters. the cheese was definitely real stracciatella, probably imported from italy and the parmigiana (eggplants dish) was extremely tasty. as main dish than we ordered one plate of spaghetti vongole e ricci di mare, 4 branzini in crosta di pistacchio e 1 pizza 4 formaggi and 1 pizza alla norma (with eggplants and ricotta cheese). the pasta was good as well as the fish. the pizzas very extremely good especially the norma one. the sauce was clearly home made and tasty. the decorations in the restaurants recalled a lot sicily , you can clearly see that behind it there is quite a care for details. music is also italian, mainly classic songs. the service is good, the waiters speak good english too and finally was a nice evening. i felt for an evening to be in a real italian restaurant. the price was a bit higher in my opinion, considering the amount of food, but in general we had a great time. if you like real italian food i highly recommend you this place. "
the ristorante delletna was a very pleasant surprise. the food is delicious and the staff very helpful.   they dont have the typical dishes that you would expect in a regular italian restaurant. this is a sicilian restaurant.
we sat in the sunshine next to the river intending to have a few beers only after a walk to the john frost brid 
the best italian restaurant overseas where to find traditional and refined cuisine in a comfortable typical sicilian ambient. very clean and worm. need to go back again. congrats
"best italian food that i ever tried in the netherlands. excellent service, delicious dishes, all superb. we reserved via the fork and got 20% discount but worthy to go without discount. authentic italian food. they gave us poise cafe from the house. we will go again for sure."
"totally disagree with the 2 negative reviews here. its a great place, with wonderful food and welcoming atmosphere and staff! the food is authentic and very tasty. cant fault it at all! the only thing is that the food is so nice that you could keep eating it! its reasonably priced too. yes, were definitely fans and hope to return very soon!"
a superb revisitation of classic sicilian dishes in a contemporary esthetic. penne al pistacchio di bronte and the calf cheek are highly recommended!
stumbled across this gem while heading to the rhine wwii bridge in arnhem. we were the only folks there for a late lunch and the owner lit the stove and cooked an amazing salmon dish for me and a fabulous filet of beef for my husband. wonderful wine and great atmosphere. the owners are italians and the food was 100% as good as anything we have eaten in italy. highly recommend!
one of the best sandwiches i ever had! cosy authentic relaxed atmosphere. italian size coffee sandwich bar. superbe coffee and helpful friendly staff. must go place
"been a few times. the pizza‚Äôs are not your average pizza‚Äôs, but better. friendly staff. the pizzeria is located in a boulder gym, which is a good combination. work off those calories before eating. only point of criticism is speed; it takes a longer than the usual time before the order gets there. it‚Äôs usually a busy place and they seem somewhat ill-prepared. "
suburban chef is a small local restaurant. mostly visited by locals however everyone will be welcomed with a warm smile. the food is good and fresh. their menu varies every week however they do also sell their suburban burger(s) which are available throughout the year. check their facebook website for the most up to date menu and week specials. don‚Äôt forget to take a side order of their fresh made french frie

"i had very little time between purchase of ticket and boarding a train. much in need of coffee, i was confronted with three choices (in this immaculately clean transportation center). a train company information person said, ‚Äújulia‚Äôs - the best koffie!‚Äù she did not steer me wrong - illy brand. the solo college student staffer also quickly made me a focaccia with ham, provolone, greens, and a dark brown mustardy paste, which i had a few minutes to eat without rushing. and i caught my train on time to boot! heel goede!"
"magical, delicious, great service!!! we rarely write reviews, but it was so great here!!! wholeheartedly recommended!"
"the staff are super perfect, the yogurt, orange juice were amazing. the croissant was the best one i have ever tried. the atmosphere was relaxing"
"this is our go to spot in arnhem. great coffee and food, an insanely large selection of teas. we had the large breakfast and to be honest, it kind of physically hurt when we walked out. was absolutely delicious!"
very good restaurant. we went here with friends to eat and this was a truly enjoyable experience. friendly staff members and very cosy to interior. you really get the feeling that you are some where in italia. and most important of course the food. it‚Äôs excellent. we want to back
"beautiful location, great wines en delicious food.  the best authentic italian dinner in arnhem, or in whole gelderland. must visit."
we visited this place twice. the first time we sat inside without having realized what we discovered the second time: a beautiful garden in the back yard.  all dishes were delicious. there is a great variety of wines.  try the catpaccio!
"after spending our holiday at sardegna, we wanted to keep our holiday feeling as long as possible. after reading an article in the regional paper about rusticana and their splendid italian food and wine, we decided for an evening rusticana. we can confirm every written word in this article; it‚Äôs traditional and gre "
"this restaurant you must visit! food is amazing: we had bresaola and buratta for appetizer, risotto and cannelloni for main course. everything was fantastic! recommended wines by service was great as well. service was very professional, polite present but not annoyin "
located in an old building in the center if arnhem this restaurant is a must for italian food lovers who like to combine good food with a pleasant atmosphere. the menu gives you ample choice of all things good in italian cuisine and they also offer an extensive choice on the special menu sheet. service is excellent and the wine choices are ample. they also offer seasonal foods such as game. 
"we had dinner with 7 people. good quality of food and excellent wind, imported by the owners.   dessert is not too sweet and of good quality"
"we had an excellent meal in a perfect ambiance, and the service was excellent, only it was rather expensive"
"relaxed atmosphere but very good food. excellent staff, italian owner. they use original italian (i guess top quality) ingredients, large choice of grappas."
good food nice restoran. stake was realy middle rare as well tastfully. also pastasuta was good. i recomend if you are in souroundings.
"one of the best places to go for good food. surpising dishes, excellent wine and good service. if you have the opportunity, you just have to go!"
"went here 5 years ago, and had an excellent meal. i mentioned this place to my colleagues and we finally had an opportunity to revisit. it was as good as my last visit. the food is excellent, and the service very friendly. this is not a typical italian, you wont find your spag-bol here. the place was as busy as i remembered it from last time, and it is best to reserve your seati "
risotto with wild cath prawn is a must try dish if you like risotto. la rusticana has nailed this dish. the lady and guy who serve us were offered top class servise. highly recommended.
"they don‚Äôt have much negative review, that‚Äôs is why i choose this restaurant for the night. after we dine in twice, dinner and next day lunch, understood why. staffs and owner was very friendly and with great knowledge of their menu and wine list, the foods were pretty amazing, very fresh and tasty, great wine to start with. we had these antipasto degustazione & saffron risotto with wild prawn tails as starter, fish of the day & linguine all‚Äôastice as main, highly recommend you to try. well, we pretty sure other of the dishes will be very nice too. we had dinner with a 22 months baby, he was tired and little out of control last night because of jet lag. owner gave me a very comfortable response and offer to help. couldn‚Äôt thanks enough to the man and lady who served us last night we had a pretty great dining experience here. the come back risotto definitely bring us back for the next day before we leave arnhem. if we come back to this place again, will definitely dine in here!"
had dinner here with friends and this is italien food as it was intended.  on the table we had fish and meat and all were prepared well and tasty.  even the staff is authentic ;-)
"dinner here was well worth the stop in arnhem. we are 2 couples traveling in the netherlands. the ambience with linen tablecloths and napkins, subdued lighting, and cozy small interior made for a delightful setting. service and food were excellent. all of us would highly recommend this choice!"
"we sat out the back and the atmosphere was delightful. definitely had a feel of tuscany about it. the carpaccio starters we had were delicious but huge, we struggled with our mains. the mains were also delicious (veal and leg of lam "
when i come to holland i always want to eat at a good italian restaurant. i love italian food. the interior is very nice and creates an italian atmosphere. the service is very friendly and quick. i went here with my wife and cousin. i had carpaccio as starter and the main course was a lasagne. very delicious.
"thats what my colleague said. this restaurant was on her list to visit some time, a must do, anyw "
authentic italian food paired with great italian wines served in a big town house. well known for their variations of carpaccio. extensive wine list. enjoy your meal at the fire place in winter time or in the walled in garden on a hot summer day. ask them to show you their wine cellar. the service is excellent.
never been here before although this restaurant exists for many years. the building is nice with different rooms to dine and wine. romantic. good waitresses and very nice. food is high quality against good price. recommend everyone who like good italian food. i will go more often here..!!
"one of our favorites in arnhem. always delicious italian food, high quality wines from italy and very pleasant service for a good price/quality rate."
"excellent italian restaurant, great food preparation, on some dishes the doses might vary from time to time, but apart from that, great quality matching the price."
amasing food in very beautiful surrounding. we ated at beautiful garden. this is definitelly place to visit if you are in arnhem.
"as a true italy lover is this the place to be in arnhem for a real and pure italian experience, italian family runned restaurant in the heart of arnhem with the strange italian customer firendly attitude serves the best italian food ever. traditional italian interior just make you fell as in italy"
"restaurant with a long tradition in centre of arnhem. it has a secluded city garden, probably the best in arnhem. ideal for outside dining. certainly worthwhile going there."
"i had dinner here with my family, we are italian and we struggle to find a restaurant that makes food as it was in italy and not adapted to local taste "
"the very best italian restaurant in town! in summer you can sit on their wonderful terrace. on a sunny evening you feel as if you are in italy . it is full with plants, a real green atmosphere . the food is excellent!"
i love the food here every time and the staff is very friendly and good at what they do and know! i would especialy recommend dining in the enclosed gardens in the summer; and having the bread (focus) appetizer (always)!
"the restaurant is inside an old house with different types of old rooms. rustic is the good adjective; not modern not old, just rustic (some places needed some maintenance, like the toilets in some walls). but ok, you go to a restaurant to eat. and the food was super good! nice and simple tastes and good portions (not pretentious petite french cuisine). on the expensive side, but the food was really good. worth a visit or two! "
"this restaurant has formal and informal dining rooms and serves some of the best italian food in the area. we always had a great food so we dont understand some of the complains about the quality varying. the restaurant still exists after decades, which tells much about the quality."
set in the main part of arnhem close to the shops. warmly welcoming staff who were attentive throughout. a good and varied menu with some specials of the day as well. i started with a great selection of antipasti and then had guinea fowl as the main course. there was a good selection of desserts but i was only able to fit a sorbet after the first two courses. all the food was very tasty and nicely served. altogether it was a step up from an ordinary italian restaurant.
"fabulous and very attentive staff. we were a group of 12 that did not have reservations, but walked in off the street. even though the restaurant was very busy, they put together a large table for us in minutes and away we we "
nice italian restaurant in arnhem. i visited other restaurants in arnhem during some years and im glad to finally have found one that suits me. the vitello tonato was correct but could have used some more capers. the steak of the house was perfect and so was the pannacota. the barbera dalba was quiet pricey.
on the 24th of april we have visited this italian restaurant. the tomato soup was fantastic. the lobster with pasta was almost unbelievable. what a super dinner we had.
"i have been here twice, and its a great place to be, also in the garden it is great and a real italian atmosphere. food and drinks are excellent. service very good"
"la rusticana in the centre of arnhem is a very good, real italian restaurant. they offer a large variety of dishes on the regular menu. in addition they offer several daily special dishess. they have a wide choice of nice wines (per glass or bottle).dishes and wines are good value for money.the vitello tonato is perfect, the osso buco with risotto very tasty and the gambas with spagetti aioli is also great. the degustazione di formaggi ( cheese dessert) is more than excelle "
one for the romantic couples and the ladies night out. wonderful selection of wines from several nations; dishes you expect in a global city not a regional location. service outstanding and priced to view as a special night out. rosemary bread good enough to make the choice on itself.
la rusticana is a solid name in arnhem. quality food and for the summer also a nice garden to dine. the restaurant is a good place for a family dinner but equally for a romantic setting or business meet.
"during the wine / food walk arnhem (la rusticana 2nd restaurant visited and sat in the beautiful courtyard. first a glass of vermentino (a slightly dry and spicy white wine) was given and when the waiter noticed that i wanted to take notes, he let the bottle even on the table. considerate! addition, we received a cannelloni of shellfish (shrimp, crab and lobster), which was full of flavor. a nice combination and the card makes you curious for more."
"amazing. a little bit expansive, but the quality of the food is really good and can compensate.the wine is one of the most lekker thing that they have. everything come from the count "
"we regard ourselves as true italian food lovers, having been places. this restaurant is among the best italian food weve had in holland so far."
"ate with a business colleague. good service, fromfriendly and attentive staff. not the cheapest menu but great italian food, and selection of wines. worth a visiy"
"my sister and i went here when we were craving pizza, and we were not disappointed! the pizzas looked huge when they came out, but the bases are super thin, so they arent bloating or difficult to get through. service was friendly, and the atmosphere was nice. we will return if we are ever in arnhem again."
"we have visited this place twice and both times had dinner with great satisfaction. the ambient is nice. it reflects wittiness, coziness and a mixture of suburban and hip - thats completely my personal opinion. its a kind of balance i like. the pizzas are super yummy. a small drawback is that i think they are a bit short in capacity. otherwise, its really nice food in reasonable price and cozy environment."
"stayed in arnhem for 2 nights, and both nights we ate here! both nights i had carbonara and chips with a drink. only cost around 12 euros, so was really great. the food was clearly freshly made, piping hot and full of flavou "
we had two superb meals here. some of our friends had a meal and told the the rest of our group to try it out. suffice it to say that on our last night in arnhem we chose here and a party of 13 was served with no problems at a 
i had the funghi pizza and my boyfriend has the trio de carne in the american crust. the crust and toppings were absolutely fresh and tasty! however drinks service is slow! nice restaurant and nice atmosphere also cheap and reasonable.
"having a meal with a party of eight at donatellos in arnhem was a great experience. friendly warm staff, a cosy atmosphere and very reasonable prices for decent food and drinks gave as well my guests as myself in the role of host a pleasant time."
always eat here one night when in arnhem. food always good and a very pleasant atmosphere.staff really friendly and helpful nothing is to much trouble. portions are good size and i always enjoy the pasta. pizzas are really good.get a take away box if u cant eat it all.
"donatellos serves great italian food for a bargain. the texmex pan pizza is awesome! the restaurant is always packed, so you need a reservation (even on mondays). the restaurant has too many tables in it, each table has just a little space and thats why i give it 4 stars instead of 5."
"donatellos does not have the most fantastic decor but the menu is good, the food is freshly prepared and the staff are attentive and friendly. the menu is well priced, ideal if you want to have a quick, tasty and value for money meal."
simple but good food in this cheap and cheerful italian joint - recommended. have been there on a few occasions and no complaints at all.
"we were very hungry and decided to grab a bite at cosi! and we hit the jackpot, great food with even better flavours nice surroundings and really nice staff. what do you need more when youre hungry!"
"i have been to this restaurant multiple times and every time it is a pleasure to be there. the atmosphere is great, cosy and the food is fine and not expensive. great to got to to catch up with friends."
"we sat on the terrace outside, where passing people cycles and cars always give entertainment. then came the pizza, which was actually very good. if the mood will be pizza again, we will not look any further"
great simple and delicious food is what you get at cosi. the staff is always friendly. they have a small menu and a monthly menu next to this. this restaurant is very populair so if you want yo be sure of a spot you should make a reservation.
"the food is honest and so is the staff giving the place a very easygoing atmosphere. surprise menu is fun. setback is the 2 shifts, if you are in at 18:00 you need to be out at 20:00. so take the late dinner if that disturbs you. other setback is that it is very crowded, two tables less would give it some space. avoid the table at the door!"
"we visited the cosi in arnhem for an evening dinner on a beautiful hot september evening. it was the first time we were there. the terrace was packed but luckily one table with two chairs was free. the service is very adequate. we ordered an italian water and beer. all food and drinks have a clear italian signature. they have a nice set of starters and primos. as usual in the netherlands secundos are not so common. also a rich variety of pizzas. the food is perfectly prepared; you feel yourself almost in italy. try also the daily specials: our spaghetti was delicious. prices are reasonable. main primos are about eur 12,50. strongly to recommend."
cute italian place with good food. the food isnt too pricy and the pizza is definitely one of the best in arnhem. theres nothing pretentious about this place; together with pleasant staff makes a nice atmosphere.
"we were looking for a good restaurant with good food but nothing too posh or pricy. cosi is ideal food is delicious and the portions are perfect, quality is excellent and the service is very friendly and it really make you feel cosy and make you feel that you are in a familiar place. i had the week menu option and my husband had the pizza both delicious. we shared a mixed antipasti plate and we were not disappointed. great option for a relax dinner."
"there are plenty of restaurants in arnhem where you can get a decent pizza, but if you want to enjoy an amazing pizza, you should go to cosi. us locals know that too, so make sure you get there on time (or make a reservation). the pastas are also great, whilst service is excellent."
"the best pizzas in town, what? in the country i dare say!  it is a small place with lovely owners and staff..clean, comfy, and the food ; to die for‚ù§"
"have a great pizza from the woodoven or enjoy some very nice anti-pasta and pasta dish.   small restaurant but the atmosphere is super, and when theres sun be sure to have a drink on the terrace."
"cos√≠ is the best pizzeria in arnhem, hands down. the atmosphere is amazing and the simplicity of their dishes are fitting with a true italian pizzeria. the staff is very friendly and if you are in doubt, theyll help you choose the best dish. overall a very nice gastronomic experience, definately a must when in arnhem."
"the restaurant is delicious but it gets full so be early or reserve. the service was perfect, and the pastas were fresh make and full of italian flavor. for a better experience i recommend sharing ;)"
"weve been here a couple of times now and always enjoy the food and the wines. if you like italian food youve come to the right place. in the middle of arnhem centre just one street away from the too crowded mainstreet, in the cosey 9 streets. lot of great shops around worthwile visiting the area. weve been sitting outside two times now and that was really nice friendly staff and service. we had mixed starters and some bottles of cold pino griccio. we choose from the very attractive menu the following: vitello tonato, carpaccio with truffle, bruschetta, oysters, tagliatelli truffle, tagliatelli nero and for desert sgroppino and tiramisu. a feast for the eye and really tastefull. we will be ba "
"great food, lovely people, super ambiente ... and best italian wines. love the place.. a must visit when you are doin arnhe "
"is it a wine bar? is it a restaurant? no, it is zafvino. last night, we had delicious antipasti with a dozen of red wines by the glass to choose from. afterwards a nice pasta dish and some dolci. a place to return to!"
excellent place for relaxing with wine and italian snacks. kind staff. outside area is very nice. less tourists than korenmarket. not overpriced.
"good glass of wine with tasty snack or meal. opens only late in the afternoon, usually very crowded. located amidst small shops."
"im coming here for some years already, in the beginning i was not satisfied with the price/quality. i saw that changing over the years. the quality definitely got better. in my opinion one of the nicest and coziest spots in arnhem."
feels like a holiday! try their zaff plank with lots and lots off yummie gooien the best..best..wines and a great atmosphere
fantastic italian food and great wines in a lovely restaurant. friendly staff.  be aware that tables are shared with others so you may have little privacy. we had the best artichoke we ever had and the rest of the food was lovely as well
at one of the nicest places in the city centre of arnhem you find zafvino. a cosy restaurant for one who loves to have a good wine to go with a great pasta or salad. not to expensive. nice staff.
"this is a great place to hang with your family, friends or partner and enjoy a good glass of wine and italian (comfort) food. they also have some less typical italian dishes on the menu for those who want something else. the wines are abundant and all equally great and when it comes to the food nothing less. but i have to admit weve not been coming back for the great italian food but in fact for the delicious tortillas. hopefully they never take these of the menu as ive never had them anywhere quite like here! regarding the ambience, lovely place to site outside on the terrace or inside at the cozy bar. "
perfect bar to visit in the weekend aftet a day of shopping with great and affordable food and wines. have been here for 3-4 times in the past months and have never been disappointe 
"if you want a local (arnhem locals that is) pub then this is great. busy, noisy and pretty sums up the clientele. fab wine, fab waiters / waitresses, delete as applicable, full of locals. not a guinness or a carling in sight."
"we happened by this restaurant and it looked interesting, the staff was friendly and we decided to eat here. good choice on our part. the decor is interesting (in a good way), the menus are on the chalkboards, and everyone seemed happy to be ther "
the service and atmosphere is great. good food and great wines and other drin 
"came in to drink some wine with a friend and had 2 really good bottles of wine which were recommended to us by the friendly waitress. her selections were spot on, and i am looking forward to returning."
"great place to be. great staff, great food and good wine! its not possible to make a reservation so be there in time! go go go...."
"living in nijmegen i know what its like to be deprived of decent pubs and wine bars. so bumping into this place after some saturday shopping was a great treat. this bar is minuscule and some facilities are so tiny that often you find yourself breathing in to squeeze through places, specially the toilet. but its precisely its size what makes the bar so cosy. tables are very close to each other so the bar lends itself to casual chatter with fellow drinkers. wide range of wines with incredibly friendly staff to help you choose a beverage to your taste. its do refreshing to see that in the netherlands someone still chooses style over functionality. the result is amazing."
"very cosy and friendly place with great food and wine. high quality ready-made food. tables for 4 and more. if you are with two you just join an other table and meet new people, very nice experience."
"we were a little perturbed by the exterior, and first impression of the interior of this restaurant. but we need not of worried we had an excellent dinne "
decent little italian place in the korenmarkt area. lots of outside seating (it was a nice evening). we had a nice lasagna and enjoyed it. no regrets.
"i love the pizzas here! thin, crunchy bottom and made in a real pizza oven! you can even see them make it if you want. great for kids as well. friendly staff and good service :)!"
"in a 5-night stay, we chose pinoccios twice because it was so damned good. the staff are attentive, efficient and very pleasant. both nights i had a pizza and each was first-rate... thin crust, yes, and a great range of fillings. i also tried the fried mussels as a starter. my wife had a pasta which was also excellent. the garlic mayo dip that is served with bread as a complimentary starter is to die for. we chose to dine indoors and the atmosphere is great! an old-fashioned long dinner candle on every table and little other lighting creates a mood and the ceiling is made from the tightly woven raffia chianti bottle wraps - thousands of them. seek pinoccio out - i doubt you will be disappointed."
"ate there 2 days in a row with 18 colleagues and were really satisfied with pinoccio. first night i had a steak with a peppersauce i unfortunately didnt like, but the day after i had the large meat plate and i couldnt finish it even though it was really great."
"i and my brothersh and dutch friends have eaten here for many(2010) years or more and always a great warm receptiona and great food, servive is good"
"i come here every now and then and always order a pizza. the pizzas arent the best, but they are good and the price is great. the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly."
"i had a meal here and it was excellent i really enjoyed it, i would recommend this place to everybody, it was such a delight and the staff were so nice plus they had a english menu."
been multiple time and the best place in arnhem!!  the bread and aioli is unbelievable - my tip is always get a second portion.   service is fantastic - cannot rate it highly enough!
"four of us had a different pizza each to try. all were delicious, freshly cooked on the wood-fired oven.  would recommend to anyone.  we had two meals there while in arnhem. pizza was the best!"
my first dinner in arnhem was here.  it was awesome.  we were a party of about 30 people.  the set up a special section in the restaurant for us.  the service and food was great.
"had dinner here 2 nights in a row. friendly good service, nice terrac "
"enjoyed the food, the service and the ambience! would recommend as an excellent, cosy place for a meal!"
"it is worthwhile to go there to have a pizza or pasta. the prices are quite fair and the atmosphere pleasant. the staff is kind and helpful. i recommend having an onion soup as well, which is very good and combines with the italian dishes of the menu as a starter."
"best restaurant in arnhem by far. staff are polite and the food is fabulous. only downside is, is that it gets very busy and loud, and the toilets are downstairs, so not good if you have a problem with stairs."
we were hungry and wanted a lighter snack.  we decided to share a pizza.  it was great!  so was the service!
went here in august 2015 and had pizza. the pizza i had tasted really good. if i ever visit arnhem again i will come back to this restaurant and try another one.
"the restaurant is long and narrow with an entrance on the korenmarkt. the pizzas are baked in a wood oven and are excellent. the service was quick and friendly. the interior is in italian countryside style, and some 5,000 chianti bottles hang from the ceiling. we thought the prices reasonable."
"ordered a pizza and unlimited spareribs. they made sure our stay at the restaurant was good, the food was delivered fast. would recommend!"
the food was excellent and the staff were very helpful . there was a lot of ambience in the restaurant and reasonably priced.
"reasonably priced, fast and friendly service. father in law demolished the mixed grill, unfortunately he would eat anything so thats no bench mark. full of local diners which tells it own story"
visited here on our 2nd night in arnhem. it was pouring but we were warm and dry outside as they have a canopy and outdoor heati 
nice traditional italic food in the middle of the city! you forget that u are in holland..a really nice place decorate it like an italic trattoria where the staff is very friendly and the dishes are very very tasteful
"my previous review of this place was 8 months ago, as a result of liking it the i revisited last week. i found that it was as popular as ever with most tables being taken early on, i guess many others like the plac "
"good food for a very decent price! we both had a pasta(me the spaghetti bolognese, she had the pasta pesto), with two drinks each and we only had to pay 24 euro! so very good value for the food you get. the portions were big too. we only had a main dish, and were stuffed after."
had dinner there for second time in two year. this year is very very regular italian dinner. quickly served and nice staff. very family friendly decorated. will go there next year when we are back in arnhem
"i visited this restaurant 3 times over the weekend of the 70th anniversary of the arhem battle. on every occasion the restaurant was packed, showing how popular it is. i was in a party of 10 lads ordering a big order of food and drink. the drinks were delivered quickly and exactly as order "
"wow, this place was amazing, busy, and yet you could stay in here longer than expected. good atmoshere and the food was second to none. the staff were great, and a bit to easy on the eye. cannot fault this place."
"came across this little gem on the 13th september, and how greatly surprised we were. the staff was very good, and the menu was second to none. if i come to arnhem again, this will be my first port of call."
"had a thin crust pizza which was very good. my colleague had the ribs never seen such a plateful before!. exceptional staff, very quick service. crowded and noisy as to be expected with this location.wonderful people watching place from the large outside seating area. recommended for food and value."
"great deal on monday, tuesday and wednesday! pizzas have a thin crust and come straight out of a traditionalover, that you will see when you enter. its a cute place. have been coming here for years!"
lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere and reasonably priced. food was good although my pasta sauce was a little bland. the pizza was good and my husband had the ribs which he said were gorgeous. great find :)
"delicious italian recipes at this cozy, inviting restaurant. candlelight gives the atmosphere a romantic touch and provides a relaxing vibe. the service and food were equally excellent."
"a pleasant surprise located in the city center : the service was fast, very friendly and accommodating. the interior is rather dark and kitschy (including a name sake pinocchio statue) but adds a fun and quirky element to the dining experience. the pizza options were good and the delivery was quick with the pizzas delivered in good time, straight from the oven to our table. a very reliable pizzeria for future visits."
5 of us had different pizzas here and we all enjoyed them. service was good and we did not have to wait long for our food.
"set in the square we arrived on liberation day, two of our party suffer stomach issues so pizza was a good choice. service was quick and friendly and the food typical pizza, good beer, in a good location for people watching. would use again."
"restaurant is situated at the back of the cathedral and by the square where the weekly market is held. walked past several restaurants and decided to go into this one. another couple arrived just as we did, otherwise the restaurant was empty this particular lunch tim "
"we went to da guilio to have some dinner and the food and ambiance were perfect! the three-course dinner is definitely worth it, and the tiramisu is heavenly! there are fresh bread and a great wine selection. definitely worth a visit!"
"fantastic for fisch lovers sea bream in salt crust with pasta and seasonal vegetables  perfect wines , and chef"
"chef provided our party of 13 with some wonderful food, mainly salt-baked cod and duck.  three excellent courses, all [i understand] prepared by the proprietor. from carpaccio to gateau! not cheap but great cuisine."
very good restaurant. small restaurant but owner is cooking and making delicious italian dishes. i really liked open kitchen over there. i recommend this place for a lunch or dinner!!!! enjoy
i usually dont like to go to italian restaurants when im traveling outside of italy. this time we decided to go as one of the people on our groups had been there several times. owner is italian the set up is really cool with a small kitchen thats visible to everyone. its a two man show. no menu basically they make what they have fresh that day!!! the antipasti were very fresh and really good! the meat was incredible and the deserts (i had tiramisu)were even better . ive heard some comments on how pricey it is etc . i guarantee you wont find a restaurant in italy that serves the same quality food at a lower price. 
"passion, creativity and refined dishes. everything is prepared with fresh ingredients. no detail left untouched. it would not be fair to rate one specific dish as the best, because they were all go "
my gf and i visited this restaurant in march 20 
"i went to this restaurant together with a business partner for launch. we are both italian and we like our true, authentic flavours. the choice was perfect. we started with a special veal with tuna sauce...it was awesome. giulio made it with some slices of fresh tuna on top, it was tasty and nice. also the ravioli that followed were great. tasty, unique. our lunch ended with a sublime lemon cake, home made, very light...something unbelievably good. i will definitely go back the next time i am in arnhem. well done, giulio!"
"the waiter made the pasta while we waited! my duck ragout pappardelle was delicious.      my wifes carbonara was equally good, with fresh pasta and home-made sauce made from scratch.  the other meal was a plate of freshly grilled vegetables/antipasto."
"as an american, i can recall when gelato came to a city i lived in during the early 1980s. it was considered ‚Äútrendy,‚Äù and sadly did not last. to my surprise this shop has been in arnhem for numerous decades. it had wonderful flavors, homemade whipped cream, and was sparkling clean! staying with airbnb, the host took me there - ‚Äúit‚Äôs my favorite!‚Äù i have to agree. a very nice experience. mangia!"
since i was a young boy (now i am 64) we loved to visit this. icecream saloon. and now after all these years we still love their icecream since its traditional italian with immaculate taste and looks.
my friend had the carbonara and she said it was one of the best she‚Äôs ever had (& she loves her pasta!). i had the stagioni pizza. it was quite good but it was meant to have mushrooms on it but it came with onions (i would have given a 5 star rating had it not been for this). i thought perhaps i had mis-read the menu. one of the waiters was really good and knew exactly what he was doing (i did inform of if the pizza topping issue); the other waiter appeared disinterested and was not really engaging. cappuccino was the best i‚Äôve had in arnhem 
"stopped here for lunch on a cold day after a quick check of tripadvisor: we were greeted warmly and served quickly. the starter of bread and dips was fresh and tasty, as were the pizzas with extra bits and bobs added as requested. great service at a good price and happy to be given the english translation menu!"
very nice pizza!! they serve great pizza and the waiters are very nice and competent. worth a visit!
"stopped for lunch on a rainy day visiting arnhem. great toasties, beer and coffee. v friendly service. what‚Äôs not to like?"
tasty thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients. pasta dishes were also delicious - went there twice on a recent stay it was so good. they let you customize your meal and are very nice. prices are excellent especially considering tax is included and the staff was delighted by a 10% tip from this silly american.
"here you can order pasta or pizza in the way you like most, even possible to add more spices or ingredients.   a real fun to enjoy your meal, served by a young enthusiast team,very tasty food in a cosy environment.  its just a must!!!"
we came to the restaurant with a group of hungry jujitsu guys after a tournament. the staff and merel couldn‚Äôt have been more kind and helpful. i even left my hat there that they mailed to me next week. thanks merel and zappa‚Äôs!
we wanted to go for n italian diner - bumped into zappa‚Äôs n sat down. our drinks came very quick but then....it took 45 min to receive the pizza n past 
"we only ordered one course, and we both had the same thing, a salami pizza. it was good, though. really good. proper roman-style base, perfectly judged topping.  ...oh, and the service was excellent too!"
zappas is a very nice place in center of arnhem. good food and nice people! pasta is very good but remember to ask al dente :) highly recommended!
"we had two superb pizzas for a family of five. salami and spinach. they were excellent, thin and crusty. we all enjoyed it very much."
"small, busy corner restaurant with friendly enthusiastic staff.  excellent thin crisp pizza with the perfect topping ratio.  the inside decor is clean and bright with a great atmosphere.  although great value, there is no compromise on taste."
"due to the positive feedback in the reviews so far we wanted to try out zappas tonight. located in a street around the corner from the train station, we were welcomed by a very friendly waiter who hooked us up on drinks immediately. we ordered a margherita for the kids, a parma and a special cheese version for one in our family with a tomato allergy. the waiter proactively suggested some additional ingredients which were great suggestions) and the served pizzas were all excellent. overall service and food excellent, great for families but also just to stop by with your friends for a good meal before you hit the bars just down the street on the korenmarkt. we will definitely eat here again!"
"went with family with 3 kids. nice crispy pizza, good size and excellent made and friendly staff.  very good prices."
"i recently went back for dinner. first time was enough to long for a second time. and again this visit was very enjoyable. vegetarian choices enough. you can create anything here yourself to your own taste. a perfect formula. staff is attentive and know the trick how to deal with many people in a small place. fresh ingredients, fair priced! reservation required. the home (white) wine was for me a little too dry (my teeth twisted in my mouth) .. there must be better ones. i will figure out next time ;-)."
it says a lot that i returned to this place a second time while in arnhem. it is a street restaurant but lovely on a warm evening. the service was excellent and friendly. i had the carbonora which was first class. the bill was so low i thought there had been a mistake!
the pizza is very good! we had the margherita with pepperoni. so american.  the service was very friendly and had a smile. they brought us a menu in american.
"very good pizza, 5/5. made from fresh indegrients.  convienet location, 5 min on foot from arnhem station, in city centre. very good customer service."
"would totally go there again, there was a little mix up with my order but they sorted that out very quickly. food was good, though we only had pasta. drinks are very small (200ml coke seems to be the usual size) overall a great experience!"
nice place ... good atmosphere ... very good stuff ... fresh food ... live cooking ... tasty food ... pasta and pizza
"nice p!ace in downtown area closed to the train station. food is fine, good pizza, not so good the cesar salad but is a good place to eat something quick while you are shopping."
"this a interesting restaurant, you can taste different italian food, very creative, with new shapes and new tastes."
"nice, cozy place. food is freshly made and tastes great! friendly staff. great place for a quick bite or to sit a bit longer."
superb pizza and fresh pastas! been here a few times now and every time the value for money was stunning. friendly people and a nice italian style interior of the restaurant make you feel being in italy for real. and of course finish off with a great caf√© espresso (love the illy bean 
"we were seated outside on the street, and we got two thin and very tasty pizzas. very nice waiter. good value for money."
we were trying to decide among the great variety of restaurants around the square and thankfuly stopped here. the food is excellent in taste and price!
we are here on a quick visit to arnhem and were very pleased. the service was friendly and fast. we had the carbonara and the margarita pizza. both dishes were very good.
"the pasta is very good, pizza was good but i could noticed that it was reheated due to the fact that their wasnt good communication between the kitchen... so it lost a bit of its freshness and pala "
by far one of the best places to eat. not over priced and great food. loved the thin crust pizza. beer just ok..
"really good food for the price point, especially compared to the surrounding restaurants. fresh pasta and pizza for under ‚Ç¨10."
"i arrived at arnhem at lunch time and zappas is nearby the station, perfect. i notice it from the unique sign (a white bike) on my way to the centrum. it is a small, nice, warm, and pretty cafe, nice ambiance for sure. i sat at the corner, charged my phone, and got free wifi. i order spinaci pizza, it was crispy and yummy, tasted good. my friend ordered carbonara pasta, it was big portion and a bowl of french bread. we couldnt finish all so we took it away in a nice package. the cakes look nice too, im gonna be back for that next time."
"fresh ingredients, plenty of option and all at a very good price. food is prepared in view by friendly staff. not my first visit nor my last and definitely a favorite in arnhem center very convenient when you are close to station and shops. i have tried the pizza and pasta and was never disappointed."
"great italien meals, friendly staff, nice & cozy ! if you are a fan of italian cuisine, its the place to go ! small, warm fast & confortable."
"ive been a lot of times here and i really like it. the pizza are very cheap 7-11 euros and very tasty ! (good spices, vegetables..). i tried also their pastas (carbonara) and the plate was huge and good too ! moreover, they propose some salads you can compose by yourself."
"nice italian food, but watch out they dont take credit cards ......really in 21st century, and a visa didnt work either! guys, sort it out, travellers dont walk around with large amounts of cash anymore!"
"this restaurant is just a perfect place for a delicious and cheap bite. the concept is great and the service is good. it is in the middle of the center of arnhem, so easy to reach from either central station or any other place in the centre. the design is lovely. great place to go to!"
great pizzas and delicious chocomel (chocolate milk) a little small but cozy and nicely decorated good service and staff
having eaten at 6 different restaurants in our weeks visit to the netherlands this was definitely the best meal that we have had. fresh ingredients always make the difference and seeing it being prepared shows the confidence of zappas in the quality of the food. friendly service - but that is normal in holland!
"we called in to the restaurant without a booking and we were lucky they could fit us in. we both chose pizza from a very wide selection, which were delicious. the service was very friendly and there was a pleasant atmosphere. totally recommend this restaurant but suggest you book before you go."
i went here with the family last weekend when we were staying in arnhem. its a little place just on the outskirts of arnhem. the waiting staff and the cooks looked like they had just walked out of college but the food they cooked was love 
"visited with family and friends, great food to a great price! we all got pizza, all of which where tasty and crisp."
"awesome food.  just what we needed, and the service was great.  if im in arnhem again im going back. great prices."
we tried the pizza the pasta and the ice cream. all were high quality and tasty. excellence service  and good english.
"cracking pizza, good thin base and fresh toppings. really friendly and helpful staff, english speaking, well behaved dogs welcome. would not hesitate to go back."
last year we visited this restaurant twice in a week and this year we did the sam 
"medium sized menu with great meals. friendly staff and very nice, small and cosy restaurant. we had dinner in june and this was so good we decided to return the same week. this year were returning again to the warnsborn campsite close by and will definitely return to this restaurant."
although tables are available and food can be served this is actually a plce to order pizza for home delivery. the quality of the ice is italian so good
"we had a great evening on the outside terrace of what is now called trivio, food was really good so was the service. we had the mixed anti pasti for starters and the bruschettas, pizza salami, pasta vongole and as a desert the absolutely gorgeous tiramisu! at rome level if you want to compare. the pinot grigio primi soli is also a very good choice with the food. we had two bottles."
"very good service. the little one had a cheese toast, and me and the misses had a chicken sandwich which was amazing!"
we stayed at a breakfast around the corner and decided to have dinner in this restaurant. service friendly and fast. food was nice and tasteful wine top. we highly recommend this place
"we were here for my burthday, so we took the surprise menu...and it was great! everything!! one of us does not eat meat, one other no fish and no shellfish. and that was no problem, we all had great food and a great time!"
"small restaurant. the menu is kind of upscale mediterranean, and we were surprised by the excellent quality of each of the dishes we ordered. good wines too... location is some 10 min walking from the city centre, but still in a historic part of town. (late 19th century or so). not sure if they take reservations, but give it a try."
"an easy going restaurant. entrance and bar are downstairs, main part of the restaurant is on the 1st floor. nice atmosphere, good food.they serve a bottle of tap water on the side, which shows their hospitality. pleasant service. the kitchen is open, which is fine... untill they started scrubbing the floor. the noice of cleaning and the soap doesnt combine well with dining. for the rest a place to go back to."
i had a meal here with my 22yr old son and 15yr old daughter. two of us had pasta bolognese and the other had a salami pizza. servers were friendly and attentive and offered conversation easily. the pasta itself was delicious and very generous portions. my daughter assures me her pizza was amazing. we had panacotta with red berries for sessert which was so yummy. the entire bill for food and drinks for three people came to ‚Ç¨43 which is very reasonable. be aware that this restaurant only take card payments - no cash. there servers do make you aware of this before they take your order. we left the restaurant feeling like the 3 stuffes little piggies. 
although this is a chain restaurant it has a good level of choice for pizzas and other italian food. the girls had carbonara and us guys the largest pizza (meat feast i think) on the menu. all reasonably priced. there isn‚Äôt a large choice when it comes to alcohol but that‚Äôs not a problem. food is very affordable and portions were generous. a place we visit yearly when in arnhem. no need to book it‚Äôs a very large restaurant. 
we visited for the first time on my sons 10th birthday. pizza was his choice of food so we decided to give this a try. the food was delicious!!!! the menu had somthing to suite everyone with a very large selection on pizzas and pastas. i opted for a calzone and i can honestly say it was the best i have every had!i also sampled a little of what everyone els had ordered and that too was perfect. the pizzas were very big and well topped. to make it all even better the prices where amazingly affordable! we payd ‚Ç¨65 in total for 3 adults and 4 children and we all had drinks and our own pizz 
we only had a main course but the pizzas were amazing and high quality - and very reasonably priced also!
came here twice while staying in arnh 
"my girlfriend and i went on a friday evening. it was busy, but we were seated right away. we got service right away for drinks and we ordered pizza. the pizza was ready within 10 minute "
portion was also really huge on top of the affordable prices. wait staff was attentive and quick to serve us. the pasta and pizza was amazing! couldnt recommend this place more
"hearty proportions with cheap prices. cant comment about it being authentic italian cuisine or not, but for a price range from 3-10 euros, happy italy is a nice choice for a dinner with your family or friends. good service too."
i couldnt believe that you can find tasty italian food somewhere outside italy. but this restaurant proved that its possib 
"stopped here for late lunch the night before we were to leave. place looked packed but still got a table in short time. menu is mainly italian so we had the cabonara and salame e capra. was a wait for the food but the restuarant was packed so not really fussed. food arrived and it was pretty tasty. well worth a visit if you feel a bit sudo-italian. just go there, have some italian food, i am betting you wont regret it. they also do take away boxes for the pizza you just couldnt finish. prices are reasonable for this place."
good piza and pasta in good price.   beautiful place good servis. wa allso did take away and took piza home
"even though happy italy is part of a chain, they offer nice italian food for fair prices, combined with quick and good service. maybe not the place where you would bring your italian business associates, but otherwise a decent place when you are strapped for time and still want a decent meal."
this is not the best italian food i‚Äôve ever tri 
"nice ambience, friendly staff. there is 100% no cash on hand - only takes credit cards. food was very quick and good value. not gourmet but good. building design and atmosphere nice."
its a chain restaurant. very nice and a great value. large and taste portions.  i definitely recommend! do not miss.
we stopped here for lunch. amazing carbonara.. and lots of it. busy but service was very quick. we enjoyed it so much we returned the following evening for takeout pizza which was also suburb. only wish is we had one near us in england!! very reasonably priced. 
dropped in here on the off chance that we would get a table on a saturday night. seated almost immediatel 
"we were 2 families, hungry :-). the food came quickly, large & tasty. good prices as well. recommended"
"this is the essence of this review. for the price they serve (quite well), one cant get anything bigger and more substantial than here. worth the queue-up. two-three pizzas serve three hungry adults and two kids, you can take home whats left. not of the best quality but good enough. the best aspect for families with smaller kids: upstairs, theres an nice little indoor playground."
"visited this restaurant prior to seeing a movie (it is located just below the pathe movie theater in arnhem and directly next to the train and bus station). we were in and out in less than an hour. selection consists of mostly pastas and pizzas. pasta carbonara was really good. creamy well cooked pasta and great taste in the bacon and ham. the other two members of the party had the pasta bolognese which they also praised. service is fast, but once served he waitress somewhat lost track of our table, and the extra mozarella ordered at the arrival of the meals was brought when we were almost finished. price is good to the point of being really cheap. good place to have a fast meal before a movie, but not really a place for an intimate dinner as the restaurant is vast and crowded."
"i came here for a quick lunch before catching the train. astonishingly cheap (10,70‚Ç¨ for drink, salad & desert) and the food was good. good wifi to work, nice atmosphere... loved it!"
"excellent value for money  huge portion size  but not the highest quality but at this price its ok friendly staff  card payments only, no cash very fast from ordering to food on table, even when busy.. well worth a visit"
we went to happy italy in arnhem to have lunch during our holiday. it is a great place to eat with kids. fast service and good pizzas for a great price!
"whenever im out with someone and i wanna grab something yummy in a lovely place, this is where i end up most of the time. the pizzas and pastas are always amazing. the nutella pizza is soo worth ordering!!"
"nice and modern place.  pizza was really quick, even before drinks :) food is good with a lot of pizza types. recommend for dinner."
"i could not image better italian food in heart of arnhem. it was my random walk in arnhem when i discover happy italy. it was amazing big portion of food. taste like you would have pasta in italy, great wine.....mmmmmm.....amazing! i highly recommend you this place!"
"it is a huge place, with huge portions, super fast and for a very low price. and the taste was also not so bad (at least this time). since it was a surprise for us, we did enjoyed a lot. it is a kind of italian fast food... but we all enjoyed! perfect with kids, not good for a romantic dinner. just try it once..."
"variety of pizza and pasta, everything with a reasonable price tag. fresh interior. great location. recommended!"
pizza - pasta - all freshly cooked and delicious and quick a lovely surprise to find on the station plaza. highly recommend
"first time at happy italy , didnt know the place but turns out is an american style fast food italian . huge portions, good quality and very fast service , all for very cheap prices  not fancy but simple and good"
"great service and friendly staff. large portions great for sharing, there also the option to take out your uneaten pizza . crispy light bases and lots of topping we all really enjoyed our choices.  tuna and salmon ones we can recommend."
i can appreciate the well thought-out marketing concept of this place. the food served is cheap and good portion ed (although i never had a problem finishing my plat 
visited this restaurant after a long day of travelling. great atmosphere with pleasant helpful staff. food and portion size is really good value for money. a must if you visit arnhem.
"my wife and i loved arnhem and looked for a comparatively inexpensive place to rest our weary bones and enjoy a light meal and some beer and wine - after spending a long day at the fabulous k-m museum. the staff were very friendly and the management gave us a wonderful table next to a window. patti chose pasta and i enjoyed my pizza. lovely atmosphere. i recommend the place to all south african visitors to arnhem, especially those bemoaning the current rand exchange trends. by the time we left, there were queues outside the door, in very cold temperatures!"
"this is a favorite amongst us broke college students since you get a good amount of food for a good price, and pizzas are usually on the table within 6 minuet "
happy italy is really fast and provides loaded plates for little money. salmon salad was fine. salmon pasta was too much pasta and too little salmon. passed on this comment as staff are pleased to be informed on this.
"they have good italian food but i love the pizza nutella most. the menu is in dutch, germany, and english, althouh i wonder why they dont have menu of drinks ."
"afligem beer. tasty pizza. very good value. fast service, apart from the second round of beers. we will be back!"
"nicely decorated, great atmosphere. good italian food for a great price. fast service and responsive staff. located right in arnhem city center and right next to arnhem central train station. next to a big movie theater called pathe. recommended :)"
great tasting ice cream. a huge selection of flavours so there is something for everyone. nice service.
great ice creams. also vegan option. downside is that when the wether is good there always is a line. mostly it will not take too long however. parking in the neaighbourhood is not too difficult
"a well-furnished modern restaurant, young and very kind waiters. thin and crispy pizza. recommended for a quick dinner. price reasonable"
nice restaurant in nijmegen at plein 44. easy parking at the molenpoort passage roof parking. 5 min walk to plein 44. restaurant was almost fully booked..tuesday evening around 18.45 arrival. ordered pizza and bread which was good. personnel is very customer friendly although i had to wait 15 min for my bill.
the food is delicous and zappas has a nice atmosphere and its a good place to go for a night out.     .
great place for lunch and dinner. superb food quality and friendly service. the restaurant has a very open atmosphere and the seats are comf 
"the food we ordered was excellent, well worth the wait, but unfortunately the wait was quite long. there were 5 or 6 people behind the bar and in the kitchen, but only two on the floor. judging by a sign theyre still looking for staff, but they could improve service by assigning specific tables to someone, since the tables more to the right were constantly looked after. it took some time before someone gave us a menu and asked us if we wanted something to drink, but the food did make up for the wait + it opened recently. hope/expect service will improve once they have more experience. if you have some time, its totally worth it (which the full tables prove)"
when i have dinner in nijmegen solo i often end up in a burger place. a regular restaurant usually takes to long and i feel a bit uncomfortable by myse 
"8 of us stopped in for dinner. we all ordered pizzas, the quality was really good. the prices were decent, typical netherlands so a little above average. however the wait staff forgot most of our orders and it took a while to receive our food and to finally pay at the end. wont be too harsh though since they seemed new. would definately go back and give it another try. "
friendly & fast service with great cafetaria food and awesome pizza!! their delivery is super...the food is still hot.
dined here this evening ... friendly ambience on the street and inside. nice selection of wines and tasty bites. clearly a wine bar patronized by locals and what better compliment can an owner receive. we enjoyed a nice spanish tempranillo along with a tasty charcuterie board and bruschetta. terrific place ...wish it was closer home.
"good evening ensured at this place. great staff, good service, amazing wines, special beers and tasty bites. they also have a great basement which can be used for parties, meetings or workshops."
"i really like a nice winebar and have found no better one than lebowski in nijmegen. very nice wines, professional and good service, they actually know their wines. and also nice bites to go with the wine. they have (normally) pricey wines by the glass for an affordable price, which makes it easier to try something nice! a must go in nijmegen."
"we ordered pizza‚Äôs on line, pizza new york and carpachio pizza tasted great and ready on time, its a disadvantage that they cooled off to much during transport home next time we will eat at the restaurant again"
"the pizza is very good, the restaurant very spacious, and the service is also good. nothing bad to say about the quality of the ingredients, which is definitely good."
"after having had some other pizzas in the same village i choose to go to la piccola...and man what a great place this is. yes its small and cosy and has great tasty pizzas, great ambience, great service and nice looking cooks ;-) . id say keep on going anne (the owner that service you)!"
"what a great place. the owner was extremely friendly, serviced good food and the atmosphere was brilliant.  would definitely recommend to all wanting to fill that gap."
"this place is great. the pizza iz pretty good. the wine is not terrific, but passable. if you want ice cream for dessert, he will go across the street & get it at the ice cream shop & bring it to you. yes, the best part about this place is the owner, who is a retired merchant seaman. he just does this for fun. dont be alarmed when he takes a seat at your table and starts talking. hes got a silly sense of humor, and you will be happier after your chat with him! if youre a snob, have no sense of humor, think too highly of yourself or dont want a stranger chatting away at your table, dont come here. for the rest of us, its a great, friendly spot!!!"
from outside hard to realise but going inside you see a well situated restaurant with a very nice terra 
"visited with my husband, daughter, son in law and 5yr old grandson. from the moment we entered we were made to feel very welcome. the staff were friendly , helpful and professional. the food, well what can i say, it all was amazing. the seafood pasta i had was the best i had ever had full of flavour, nobody else had any complaints. yes it is a little expensive but well worth it. there is an eating area outside too. we will definitely visit again. "
me and my colleagues really enjoyed our dinner(s) at the villa borghese in amstelve 
we were staying in schipol overnight and after seeing the menu in hotel decided to eat out. found on internet this place via a gluten free app. my wife has a gluten allerg 
"very good fish, nice setting. the mix between keeping some indoors space and still leaving a lot of open room for outdoors was nice. acceptable distancing between tables given corona. not necessarily the best view but nice setting inside"
"the food was good, service alrig "
"i was in amsterdam for work but staying near schipol and searching for a cozy place to eat that was also budget friendly. wow, i lucked up and found this elegant spot less than two miles from the renaissan "
"villa borghese is located near the amstelveen town hall , in the old village and close to the lake called de poel  we decided to enjoy come good italian food and when you are in italian cuisine mode vila borghese is the obvious choice. the restaurant is modern , stylish and you can feel the mafia eating here :-) the service is friendly and excellent at the same time. the food was prepared in a true italian way."
"this restaurant has had various guises and names over the last 40 years plus. the lay out remains the same and the menu is definitely italian. its a very large restaurant ( reminds me of restaurants in turkey..rooms and rooms) but remains friendly and intimate. one of its most attractive points is the gorgeous terrace, with huge parasols/ umbrellas ( they work so well have remained eating desert, and and on the house limoncello, even during a a huge storm. when the weather is good its a beautiful sheltered spot and one forgets there is a huge motorway down the road and is transported to somewhere in ita "
"we, four adults and two young children, had a dinner at this italian restaurant and were the first customers at that day. soon the restaurant was full so i recommend to book a table in advance. there were lots of families with children there so this is a child friendly restaura "
i have been on friday and it was a great experience. i picked very italian dishes such as burrata and pasta with seafood. definitely enjoyed the dinner with my partner
"we had dinner with a group of 14 persons. we didnt order from the set menu but left it to them. they brought lots of different dishes, all pretty good and tasty food. we only skipped the second piatti because we were getting full. i loved the gnocchi! we will go back. no such thing as bad staff they paid attention and were quick to come by without asking for it. had a great time!"
"we went to this beautiful italian villa restaurant for dinner. its a big restaurant with nice ambiance. we tried ribeye, grill chicken both were nice!"
"it was my first visit with a good friend, near my neighbourhood. didnt expect much the rating is good so we tried. that evening turned out to be the best itialain in amsterdam! a combination of great value for food, sophisticated interior, every details made the big difference. not to mention friendly service. definitely will be back."
"from the moment you enter this restaurant, you can easily see and feel the higher standards of quality it offers compared to many other italian restaurants. it is very clean and spacious, with lots of room between the tables, and the lighting and d√©cor are extremely good and provide a nice atmosphe "
"if you like italian food this is the place to be, lots of choice of pizza, pasta or meat. nice atmosphere, friendly service"
"a lovely restaurant near de poel, an artificial lake. in the summer you can eat outside. food is good and it quite spacious. service is fine. all in all a very nice dining experience. and free wifi."
the food was very good and the service also very good. the place is very nice but maybe if there are some groups having dinner can be a bit noisy. even that i recommend you to go there to enjoy very good italian food.
our friends have visited villa borghese many times in the past and wanted to take us ther 
genuine italian restaurant. quite a big place but atmosphere is ok. decorations are photos of italian movie stars. never knew marilyn monroe was italian though.  pizzas are large and well filled. pasta was wxcellent and tasty. good service by friendly waiters.  will go there again.
"went here with the family. we had great food, some delicious starters (fish and meat platter and well cooked aubergine). main courses were great too, good pizza, rich tasty tomato sauce, lots of toppings and some great pasta dishes."
"had an early dinner sitting at the garden ‚Äì a lovely atmosphere surrounded by nature and a relaxed environment. cuisine is typical italian, from pizzas, past to fish & meat. good wine list and attentive service. had pasta with a glass of montepulciano and it was very good. prices are reasonable. a place to share some good food with friends and family."
lovely meat and mozzarella platter. tasty bread. lasagne was ok. very friendly interactive staff.  we sat in the conservatory but the inside looked good too.
"visited one evening and dined outside in a very pleasant area in the sunshine...lovely. waiters were very busy but still helpful and friendly. i had a pizza which was made to order and very tasty, dessert of tiramisu was excellent. would recommend."
very good place in quiet area as remote from the city centre. food is delicious and the service is perfect and quick. i visited it with my friends but i believe this place to be good for romantic dinner as well. enjoyed it very much:)
villa borghese is a older restaurant under new management since early 2016. i was with a small group and had dinner there on a monday evening. i had a reservation but it was not needed although the waiter said they were quite busy on weekend 
"i ate there with my friend and it was delicious, the people there were very kind and friendly. i advise to give it a tryüòÅüëç!"
the italian food with dutch touches served in this place is one of the best i have ever tried so far. i would highly recommend it to anyone who happens to be in the area. super deliciois and very friendly staf!
well im not much of a pizza eater. but it was a helluva day with my ongoing flight to bergen cancelled. i found myself in a lovely boutique hotel in a gorgeous su 
"when you are a poor frenchman looking for a good evening, go for it. nice and charming welcome to strangers in research for a warming ambiance."
very friendly and fast service. good choice of delicious pizzas prepared in an original pizza oven. can recommend. it makes sense to reserve a table.
everything was fine and delicious and perfect served the pizza guys know their job. better reserve for table it‚Äôs completely occupied in a few minutes
late in the evening we have zearched some good food. found this restaurant. perfect service. tasty pizza. 10/10
excellent pizza‚Äôs.  family friendly and good service. one of our favorite restaurants in amstelveen for a friday evening pizza.
"coming back from a visit to a hosptal we took here our dinner. the restaurant is cosy and the staff is friendly and helpfully. we ordered a pizza quatro fromagi, al funghi and verdure, drinks: ginger tea. the pizzas and the drinks were delicious, like in a good pizzeria in italy! we will come back for sure."
nice restaurant with a real wood oven where excellent pizzas are being prepared. the house red wine is nice as well. the staff is young but professional. will come back for sure
"...which justify the prices (av. ‚Ç¨12-14) at this friendly place on the old amstelveen high street. bookings arent taken, so dont be surprised if youre turned away or asked to wait. the menus we were given were solely in dutch, but we understood enough to make a choice, and in any case the waiter spoke fluent english. pizza and a glass of house wine cost ca ‚Ç¨20 per person."
"excellent crust and ingredients. the margerita, verdure, and gustosa (ham and arugula) are the best choices."
i have been here few times now. very nice atmosphere. very nice pizza. service good. free parking outside.
friendly pizzeria in centre of the old village of amstelveen. staff friendly. pizza prepared by italians in wood oven and italian red house wine was perfect. price very reasonable   16‚Ç¨ for pizza and two glasses of wine. easy relaxed restaurant. highly recommend.
"restaurant has great atmosphere and staff are most friendly. pizzas are made in a wood fired oven and are no doubt the best in town, bar none! highly recommended!"
"this italian restaurant with its traditional pizza oven in the open kitchen is a very nice addition in amstelveen so called oude dorp. yesterday was our 3rd visit of which the second time with kids. this visit we took as a starter the misto tagliere, which is a nice variation of meat, grilled veggies and cheese. the menu is not very big with 12 pizzas on it however this makes it a little bit easier to choose. sufficient and friendly staff. our kids were already looking forward to the pizzas and even more to the kids desert. we will be back for sure."
"definitely the best franchise pizza in town .  quality was consistent with the north american stores , though it is a bit pricier than other shops in town."
we regularly order from here as it is my childrens favourite pizza. the ingredients are fresh and tasty and the pizzas come quickly. there are lots of offers so you can get a bargain.
"we just want a simple dinner when we saw papa johns pizza. we order one and it was prepared quickly for take away. it was hot, nice, and delicious. perfect for hungry stomach.."
"we have been living in germany for the past three years. when i seen a papa johns motor bike i was super excited. we ordered a large pizza. at first we were skeptical about it being authentic. the pizza arrived on hot and on time. it even came with the signature garlic sauce and pepper. the taste was amazing. i felt like i was in america again. we were sad that we didnt order two. if you are in the area, order from papa johns!"
"after 3 times in italy and many ice cream, trust me this is the best ice cream . try the strawberry ice cream , the pistaccio and the banana"
just great handmade ice-cream. a lot of different and very tasteful varieties. also very helpful and interested staff. all in all great stop for a nice ice-cream.
the last view weeks we ordered delivery from  the italiaan restaurants in amstelveen area that deliver to our home and this one is the winner. tasty pasta and well made pizza. only negative is that the delivery took long but it was worthwhile the wait.
"we were staying across the road whilst on a rugby and whilst helping heineken boost its annual turnover we got a little peckish. this was a little gem of a place, great food and was happy to customise pizzas to accommodate our british pallet. really friendly staff and great food give it go. the waiter asked if we wanted garlic on the pizza, boy did we get it. made a good pizza in to a fabulous one !!!!"
"the atmosphere and food are very good.  staff is friendly and the child friendly. pizza, pastas, entrees with many choices.  quality of food and level of flavor has always been high."
"we enjoyed the food here, its very italian, tasty and very reasonably priced. pastas are good, meat as well."
"absolutely one of the best italian meals we‚Äôve had! the cherry tomatoes with burrata in warm olive oil, linguine truffle creme done by the table, cooked in a solid cheese bowl and the warm service from this family from napoli, were just a wonderful treat on a cool spring evening in amstelveen. highly recommended! we are sure to find our way back there again."
one of the best meals anywhere  italian done very well . superb flavors. 6 of us for a business dinner and no issues only complements  tirimasu to die for and veal outstanding
really nice and cosy italian restaurant. good and friendly servive and outstanding food. have been there twice already and will come back again when i am in the area.
the best pasta i have ever eaten!  very delicious. kind service.  i will be back there soon! cant forget that taste üòç
"the best italian food around amsterdam ive had so far. the staff is really friendly, and the food is to die for. the menu is so extensive, you have to go back there multiple times to try everything."
went there for dinner and lucked out to find a seat. i had the carpaccio and the pasta .....which was finger licking good. my wife ordered a salad which was also awesome as was the lamb chops my friend ordere 
i love this carbonara ! and i like this veri sapori family. the busiest restaurant in amstelveen. need a reservation.
a gem of a place! home away from home by all means. and the highlight of a superb dinner was the sgroppino made by mario himself at our table. an amazing italian cocktail..
"....make sure to visit this secret hideaway! stuck in the suburbs of amsterdam this local hangout serves mouthwatering italian dishes. as they make very clear before you enter the restaurant, they don‚Äôt serve pizza. well, you don‚Äôt miss the pizza for a second. fresh prepared dishes served with a smile. this family really loves what they d "
we were able to be fitted in after coming after 21.00. very busy but also very good. i would like to return there soon. nice people owning the restaurant and serving.
when going to amsterdam on business trip ive never imagined that i could find such a great place to taste italian cuisin 
ive been there two times and both were excellent. the attention was very nice and the food incredible. the place its not much big so it is worth to make a reservation if you wanna go there. i recommend you all to go there if you like true italian food!
what a treat! typical southern italian atmosphere with great service and excellent food. two brothers and their families who know what they are doing. a must when you are in amstelveen
"the food is excellent, the ambiance lovely. but the service is not so go "
i was early and was given a table despite not having made a reservation. making a reservation is definitely adviseable as the place is packed every evenin 
"aouthentic italien restaurant. staff talk italien. food is made italien way, tastes like million dollars, italien hospitality, every thing reminds italy, but it takes place in amstetdam. run to the restaurant...."
"my wife and i visited veri sapori yesterday. delicious italian food, one of the most traditional you can find in the area. pasta with truffle, pasta with tomato sauce and shrimps and shrimp salad with rocket. definitely worth a visit."
"i need to go back there soon, would really love to try out all their dishes!  also go to the italian icecream shop next door, its also very good!!"
veri sapori is a small local restaurant that will surprise you with its dishes of unusual quality. the true tastes of italy give you the feeling that life is good and want to have more of it. it is a little gem you do not expect in this hidden corner of amstelveen. we have been here a couple of times and we have changed our favourite local italian restaurant to this one immediately.
"my husband and i just moved to amstelveen and came across this place by accident. we walked in on a friday evening and got the last table. the service was great, food was delicious and atmosphere was really friendly. we will definitely be going back!!!!"
"after a cold and wet afternoon, all we wanted was a warm and tasty dinner nearby. veri sapori is the perfect place for excellent italian food with cosy ambience. menu isnt elaborate but each item we ordered was executed very well. we will make this place our neighbourhood italian kitchen. do make reservations. "
"my friend invited us this restaurant, outlook of that does not give any idea. the place is not large and has limited seats. the italian family whose operates this restaurant creates fantastic tastes. steak which is sliced as small bites taste can not be explained it has to be tasted. also desserts are fantastic. everyone who wisits amsterdam must go to this restaurant "
"this a great place to seek out if you are in the amsterdam area.  good food, service and italian atmosphere. when you leave there is great ice cream shop next door, expect to join a que in the summer."
"by chance we came to veri sapori, it is tucked away in a corner and does not promise what it actually offers: great italian tastes and  an informal admosphere. try it and know you will return..."
"this is definitely a must if you are in the area. in amstelveen veri sapori is really a good quality restaurant driven by a full italian family since more than 10 years. they bring the really italian quality, not always granted for an italian restaurant, but here all is italian, from the people to the real quality food. they made dessert on their own instead of buying a standard one, the quality and the variety of all the others plates are super "
after 2 terribile food weeks in amstelveen we found very sapori at about 30 minutes walking from the hotel and seem like found a oasis in the desert. real italian food in nederland!!!  the best plqce that you can find!!!
i have eaten here a couple of times and the food always meets the expectations. i like this restaurant although the decoration is a bit poor.
a super little italian restaurant with a signature dish. a pasta dish with truffles flambeed in a huge parmigiana carcasso.    great owner and quite a wine list.     enjoy.
there is no way to go in the last minute without reservation to they great italian restaurant in amstelve 
excellent italian food. tastes like its come from italian mamas kitchen.  service is sometimes friendly. there is space for improvement.
"tucked away behind an italian ice cream parlour. nice inside and good to be able to speak italian with the staff. service is efficient, but could be a bit more personab "
"be sure to make reservations, because this restaurant is always fully booked. why? because it is so good. the real taste of italy in amstelveen. a special dish is the pasta made with parmezan cheese that is carved out of a big round parmezan cheese after being softened with burning liquor. if you like meat, the ossobuco is scrumptious. so are most of the dishes they serve."
"my favorite italian restaurant in the area. its quite a weird location, but worth the travel, because the food and wine are truly great!"
"one of our favorite restaurants for real italian cuisine. you really need to make reservations in advance, because they are usually fully booked. besides the regular dishes they always have daily specials, but my favorites are for starters the prosciuto crudo danieli; and the mixed plate with vitello tonnato, bell peppers and other delicacies. for main cours try atleast once the pasta with mushrooms prepared in a large parmezancheese. after putting burning liquor in the hollow parmezan cheese they add the pasta (already prepared in the kitchen) and than add the flavour of the chees by scraping the cheese out end mix it with the pasta. scrumptiou "
"visited this restaurant for lunch today. what a treat - run by italians and a lives up to the true tradition of good italian cooking. its not terribly big, so for the evening booking is a must, but it is open for lunch, which in the netherlands is always a bonus. we had one of the best spaghetti vongole ever and the choice of wines was equally good. will be going back on a regular basis."
this restaurant captures the true spirit of italian cuisine and atmosphe 
"after traveling regularly to the netherlands and having got rather bored of the same menu at the hotel, i was taken out to this restaura "
"having traveled to amsterdam for many weeks with work and after getting very bored of the same hotel food, i was taken out to this little restaurant. it was a tuesday evening and the place was fully booked (thank goodness we had booked a tabl "
"hadnt been to veri sapori for many years, for a number of reasons one of them being the comments about the nigh prices. and no, this is not a pizza restaurant so prices are higher. but the food and the service are definitely worth it! the vitello tonnato was wonderful: nice thin and tender slices of veal, not the dry thick cuts you sometimes get and great sauce. the other starters were just as good and the main course ( which 4 of our party of 6 had) of risotto with scallops and green asparagus was so go "
we have eaten in this restaurant many times and not once were we disappoint 
"the location is horrible, but the food is gre "
"the first day in amsterdam and the first pizza here, it was the best pizza weve ever ate and the waiters were so lovely!!!thank you !! i can only recommend it :)"
"we come for a date night, all the dishes was great and tasty , the service was wonderful . we come back 2 times after!! we will come back next time !"
"we were a bit concerned when we got to the address using google maps. it took us to a nearby shopping complex which was part closed and a bit run down. most people were eating outdoors but it was still quite cool in early may so we ate inside with one other table occupied. in the end the food was delicious - we had the assorted meats antipasti and the crostini, both of which were very nice. our son had pizza which looked good, my wife had ravioli which she said were delicious and i had lasagna because i needed some comfort food! it was the real deal with rich cream and tomato sauces. the panna cotta was homemade, had a good wobble but lacked a little flavour. we had a bottle of chianti which was very nice though a little pricey. overall a genuine italian experience."
"i can highly recommend this dolce verona. there were six of us:  four adults and two children and we all were very satisfied with the food, atmosphere and service. thanks :)"
"the atmosphere is warm and friendly. it is home-style restaurant, located in a quiet area in amstelveen, near by amsterdam. we karpaccio, steak, pasta."
"after an incredible day in amsterdam, we decided to cap it off with a visit to the restaurant recommended by our airb&b host: dolce verona. we had no expectations, which made the marvelous evening we had even more surprising. we were greeted and seated by jj, our waiter for the evening. he was very concerned about my wifes food allergies, and went to great lengths to recommend menu choices that were safe for her. his good humor, charming personality, discrete but thorough attention, and intimate knowledge of the menu made the evening special. his equally personable colleague eva visited several times to ensure things were going well. the kitchen has some very talented chefs. we ordered homemade minestrone, which was delicious and generous. my wife had the salmon, which was grilled to perfection and served with a delicious sauce and excellent fresh vegetables. i had the lasagna regina, cooked al dente and smothered in a flavorful bolognese sauce. dessert consisted of several house-made specialties that outshone all previous versions in other restaurants. the wine selection was appropriate, and the coffee after dinner marvelous. the combination of kitchen, service, and ambiance rose above most restaurants wed previously visited, and we immediately booked a table for the following evening. i rarely offer five stars, but but dolce verona deserved every one of them."
"the food was delicious, as was the wine. the price of food was more reasonable than i first anticipated. staff were friendly and attentive. would definitely go again when i return to amsterdam"
"nice service, quick, good food, i had half pizza and tortellinis with truffle sauce. this was quite ok. sauce was very good, the waitress was very nice and the prices are really in the good average. to be recommended"
"calm and nice place with very very delicious italian food, very helpful servants, you shoul try it and then pray for me ü§£ü§£ü§£"
"great place, excellent service and very italian taste! its good place for couples, family visits and friend reunion."
"perfect pizzas,great meat dishes,ok service.nice restaurant with a good food,have no home wine only the wine in the bottle."
we love taking our children to this restaurant. always good service and the food is great quality. would highly recommend for a great value meal. we particularly like the carbonara and pizza
i had dinner here with a friend. the menu consisted mostly out of numerous pastas and pizzas. but the good stuff is found in the meat dishes. we started our dinner with a big plate of antipasti for two. but in reality this was easily enough to feed three peopl 
we were recommended this restaurant by the owner of the b&b we stayed at nearby and it was exactly as he described it. a vast range of pizzas (i have never seen a menu with so many different kinds of pizza!). clearly very fresh ingredients and the staff were all very friendly. definitely recommended.
"we had something to celebrate and went with 4 people for a dinner. when we made the reservation we were advised to change our arrival time a little since also a large group came at the same time. always nice if they think ahead! when we arrived we were welcomed very friendly and we could choose where to sit. they didnt mind our baby and were very friendly to the baby. good and timely service, very good real italian food, friendly people and a real good price. like in italy they dont mind if you order a pizza which is not on the menu. even gluten-free for my wife was no problem."
best pizzas ive had in my life so far. has a section where kids can play until the food is served.
"stopped for lunch on our way to a football match. great choice, everybody happy with their choices and would come back again next time in doetinchem"
we had a delightful time with friends at this italian styled restaurant. i ordered the lasagna with salmon and it was excellent. all the pizzas that passed me by to other tables and my friend looked very good but my stomach was just too small to eat more. i also had the sou 
italian restaurant stretto (eten & drinken) is situated close to the market square in the centre of doetinchem. when we visited them we were lucky with the weather and could sit at a table on the terrace. where you can observe all the passers-by and have a great meal at the same time

"the service is quick, polite and helpfull. the pizza tastes very nice with a crisp crust. nice place to go with your family"
we tried pibia without specific recommendation but were not disappointed. we received a warm welcome and enjoyed the food. you can opt for many different pizzas and also listing of ice cream variations is impressive. for us a pleasant experience.

"for us italians living abroad is not easy to find a place that really makes you feel at home, but il caminetto does just that. fresh ingredients and italian products cooked amazingly by the young chef, a traditional menu but with also innovative recipes, great wine and most importantly a very warm and welcoming atmosphere! a real italian dinner, ended up with dolce, caff√® e ammazzacaff√® accompanied by a lovely chat with the owners and waiters. totally recommend it!"
"visiting this restaurant very often, food is allways nice and fresh. shefs are really good at their job, staff is allways friendly. i wish there was more chicken dishes. overall 9/10"

"what can i say? its a pizza place, and the pizza is good. they have all your usual topping with a few more uncommon ones."
the prices were excellent and the pizzas were very good.  even though it was very crowded it didnt take too long for our pizzas to get done.
"new york pizza serves excellent pizza for a great price, especially at take away. love the gyros pizza with tatsiki"

"the restaurant has an outside terrace, but that was unfortunately closed. staff is quite young but very friendly. food is good italian pizza, but also the normal secondi piatti. it tasted quite good! the restaurant serves french fries with the italian dish!"
we checked in for dinner in this restaurant in the historical fortress of hellevoetslui 
"we were there o the hellevoetsluis fortress days, so it was very busy and all tables were reserved. but despite that, the service was fast and friendly. the food was very good;my granddaughter had a salami pizza from the childrens menu which was excellent! the restaurant is on a nice location with a terrace with beautiful view on the harbour with museum ships and marina. the good service, very good food and nice location we liked best."
"we where with a large group and had a high top. the service was friendly and fast. the drinks we ordered arrived very quickly! the food was oke but not very special. the pizza quattro fromagio was for my feeling not with 4 cheeses but oke it is the way it is. conclusion nice place, good service / friendly and oke food.

there are many ways to fall in love with someone. but there are also many ways to fall in love with a restauran

no standard pizzas and pastas but a proper modern italian restaurant! also good for lunch or a drink after work.
they have a little card with season meals. if you want to try something you can choose for a meal with little portion for two persons. nice. free wifi.
they have a good italian kitchen. in summer you can also sit outside and have lunch or dinner. or just relax with a cappuccino or a glass of wine.
we were looking for the restaurant when suddendly it appeared across the water. some nice outside lights are giving the old building the glamour which it deserves we enjoyed a 2 course dinner at fortezza which was perfect and more than enough.
my family and i visited la gondola on our way through nl. found it on tripadvisor.   the food was tastefull. not the very best italian food we ever had. but still very good.
great and fast service. friendly and good organized staff. great and tasty food. super environment and location. open kitchen.  i think the largest and best restaurant of lemmer.
best pizza in all of amsterdam zuid for sure. like italian bodem thin but crisp great fresh products all self made
i was on my own in lemmer and was recommended la gondola! i had a lovely pizza and the restaurant had a great atmosphere and the staff were very attentive!  i would certainly go back with friends!!

"good food, although the pizza was far from being an italian style & quality.  good and prompt service, well organized"
it took a few minutes wait for an outside table and worth the wait. full menu with full array of italian options. i enjoyed the putanesca. the salad bar had lots of choices i don‚Äôt see in the u 
"this is a popular place with the locals so worth booking or arrive around 7.30pm when early diners are finishing. if you walk along the waterfront to get here you will pass quite a few quite reasonable restaurants but if you like italian food and that means more than just pasta and pizza this is the place. it‚Äôs a much bigger place than it looks, the locals enter from the other end where there is car parking. all dishes are good ranging from excellent meat and fish dishes to pizza and pasta all at sensible price "
best pizzas in town and super fast service.  they have a super big menu so it takes longer to choose a pizza then waiting for it when its ready.
"foods were really good, ingredients used are super fresh. service was efficient too. price definitely reasonable.   highly recommend!!"
"we visited this restaurant for dinner. it is located in a nice spot on the harbourside, parking is available in the area. its a big place and we were amazed by the extensive choice of pizzas in various price ranges. we tried a few and also ordered some starters that turned out to be excellent. the house wine that came with it all was fine for a reasonable price. fresh strawberries with cream topped everything off nicel "

"perfect place to enjoy the canal action,the small town activity, the locals and the tourists.perfect for  a group and for a family with children.good quality, fast service with a smile."
"we were with a group of 5 and had a good experience. we all loved our food, which was the main deal. a little disappointed in the waiting staff, they seemed a little inexperienced. therefore, no 5 stars, but the food wouldve be worth it!"
"good restaurant in the heart of lemmer. warm atmosphere, good food, friendly staff. must visit for pizza lovers!"
"as usual the best pizzas in vecht area, thin and crisp! try the choco pizza for desert and enjoy your favourite food twice in one diner."
best pizza i have ever had! pasta specials are equally delicious. family friendly and a nice outdoor terrace. we were visiting from canada stayed in the village for 5 days and ate here for 3 of them. thanks cynthia for your wonderful hospitality!

"good pizzas clean place, the prices of the menu are not expencive the only minus point is the position of the restaurant"
"we came there after our trip to zaane schans as the restaurant is just few steps walking from the village. it was not busy at all at 1p.m. the two waiters were super friendly. we got a table next to the window with an excellent view to the other bank of the river. they got a huge menu with plenty of choices. the food was okay, not very impressive at all. what surprised me was the way they charged us ‚Ç¨6 for two cups of water, which we think it shouldn‚Äôt be there. "
"this restaurant turned out to be an excellent choice for lunch at the end of our zaanse schans visit. the day was perfectly sunny and hence we sat in the outside (under an umbrella shade) with amazing view of the zaan river and windmills. such a peaceful place to have your lunch and savoir all the natural beauty zaanse schans has to offer. along with it, we tried two type of pastas - both were well prepared. loved the place and the food here."
the restaurant was a real surprise. it has the menu on the street with the price too so you can choose your dish before you ent 
"staff were great. salad ,cheese and lasagna,also pizza were so delicious and fresh...we loved it so much."
this was a very positive surprise during our visit to zaanse schans. the day was warm and it was nice to enjoy some lovely canneloni on the terrace outside. the food was amazing and very authentic and such was the service. absolute must visit in zaanse schans. 
by the end of a wonderful day in zaanse schans is good to have a break on a terrace looking over the canal and have pasta or pizza with a beer. we were 10 frinds but does not seems to bother them. the orders came quick and the food was ok. you can see also the bridge nearby closing for traffic in order to be lift for large boats to pass it. enjoy!
"the nicest little place, to relax, have a beer, coffee, an excellent pizza,  and one had to try the tiramisu."
the menu has good variety of italian dishes to choose and the food was also very go 
"very nice boat trip you can buy a ticket while visiting the zandschaans it takes you up the river zaan and it points out all the old industry that still exits along the zaan and the barges that still bring the products that the factories need, on the orher side of the zaan you see lots of typically dutch zaan houses, the canal trip is not expensive, and you get to see the zaanse culture, the boat trips in amsterdam by tours & tickets are much more expensi "
excellent restaurant and very friendly staff. the menu is very good. we indicated the restaurant. great experience.
we were lucky to get a table next to the water.  so we had a great time having excellent pizzas and very good local beers.

coming for business i stayed in zaandijk. this italian restaurant with the best view has the perfect pizza! after just having a beer at the terras and seeing all this great dishes i decided to have dinner here and that was a good choice. the waiters are very polite and working really hard. but they give everyone attention and having fun with each other. a pearl across a great view is worth trying. i would definitely recomend this italian restaurant if you visit the netherlands!
after seeing zaanse schans we saw this beautiful terras accross the bridge. italian restaurant il mulino in the netherlands. as italian we wanted to try this. perfect italian food made by a cook from roma italy. the people working are really having fun with each other and you can see they are like family. we took 7 pizza and it was like eating at home in ital

"we have vouchers for this restaurant which is part of the hotel next door. nice service, but when busy it takes a while before your dish arrives. this was not a problem at all with a quiz handed to my son to keep us occupied. all in all a good place to eat."
"as hotel guests, we had complete breakfast there. coffee/tea, bread, yoghurt, and all kinds of jam. on the afternoon, we had broodje hawaii (with pineapple) for lunch."

"great service, excellent kitchen, enjoyable atmosphere, cosy! we dined with colleagues for a business party. exquisite wines."
"artusi is attached to one of the bilderberg hotels, normally not my favorite type of setup. but this is different. pretty authentic and good quality italian food. good parking. but the al fresco dining is awesome. terrace faces south so sun all afternoon and evening. view of the lawns and the woods. it all has a lively but distinguished atmosphere without totally breaking the bank. pleasant service. "
"had small dinner but very tasty.  mix of italian antipasti, second homemade ravioli and as a dessert the tiramisu. friendly and warmhearted service! good wine selection."
"for sure i will keep in mind that particular dinner . i loved it so much . exquisite food - italian style - with a perfect wine , cozy atmosphere and good vibe an energy . i had as a starter a mix plate with italian appetizers, from which i can surely tell you that the chef was good . not just some salami and mozzarella but a fine touch of truffles and asparagus . quality of food high ! . as well as the oil /vinegar and all other extras which were served at the table . as a main course i had pasta which again matched my expectations . i highly recommend to try this place ."
"as with other aspects of the hotel artusi is part of this restaurant is puzzling. are we in artusi? where is the italian food? ahhh... we are in the part that does not serve italian food. set menus more based on french with a meditteranean touch it seems. as food came with our room, we had four of these set menus. unfortunately moving over to the tables where we could have italian was not possible given the arrangemen "
"had a great dinner on new years eve. fantastic italian cuisine in a very nice setting. all dishes are very well taken care off, authentic."
"the trattoria is situated within the bilderberg hotel. the cuisine is good, although not exemplary, and for a reasonable price. the staff is friendly and knowledgeable."

its been an incredibly long time since ive had such gourmet food. really great.  i had 4 courses and every course was an experience
we are having a trip with friends and we visit elburg 
"the title says it all. i ordered the cod, which looked magnificent. the taste was even better and the combination of flavors was great. the staff was very friendly and i was overwhelmed by the extras (amuse, seasoned popcorn, etc.). would definitely recommend this place. it is wise to make a reservation as it is located on a main street and fills up quickly. "
such a nice evening in da pietro.  very original food. good wine list very decently priced. the atmosphere is great and service outstanding
"just returned from a wonderful diner with friends at da pietro. we choose the suprise menu which consists of four courses. we let these courses be joined by complementary wines. and complementary they were. after some startup problems (busy evening) everything just clicked. the service, the food, the wine. just go there and experience it."
"da pietro offers excellent food and keeps coming with surprises. location and restaurant interior are real cousy, adds to a great evning enjoying your company. staff is very friendly, doing all necessary to give you a nice enjoyable time."
"i eat at da pietro many times and held bigger and smaller parties/celebrations here, which are always exactly as i hoped for as pietro and hetty full with nice ideas and because the restaurant (interior and patio-wise) cater perfectly for it. the great thing is that you can also hop by for a shorter, casual dinner. i love that they change the food with the seasons and make inspiration-trips to pietros home-country every year to get inspired. because of this, the menu changes regularly so that there is always something new to try. absolute quality (and real-italian food) for your money."
what a great find in the lovely town of elburg. the surprise of the chef was outstanding! the pizza was superbe too but regretted not having taken something from the menu! with the biological wine and the excellent service the evening was a huge succes
"we went here to celebrate a birthday with friends - and were so glad we did! its a gorgeous restaurant in a charming little town, with a beautiful terrace in front to spend a sunny sunday afternoon (though inside is lovely and cosy, i can imagine its perfect in winter too!) the food is italian, with unusual regional specialities and favourite family recipes. on a sunday they lay the bar out buffet style, with a fantastic array of dishes - im still dreaming of those baked eggs in tomatoes and leeks! take a plate and go up as often as you want. we were completely stuffed by the time we left! as vegetarians, we were thrilled to see how many options they had for us. brilliant place with fantastic, friendly staff (thank you hetty and gerritjan - hope we spelt that right!) "
"recently visited this restaurant with my friend. the restaurant has two ding rooms, the main one at the entrance and one at the back. the one at the back is more pleasant, but we ha door place reserved at the entrance. we went for the 3 course menu and for the main meal we had the pesce rosso (roodbaarsfilet) and the pettine di vitello (kalfsoester). the first one was very good, the latter a little bit chewy. we enjoyed it a lot. the service was great and we even even enjoyed a free limoncello at the end. we will surely be back again...."
great tast experience. friendly hosts. make sure to make an reservation otherwise you will be disappointed. tip try the brunch on a sunday mind blowing good !!
"on the way back from a business trip north we diverted to da pietro in elburg, which is rumoured to be one of the best italian restaurants in gelderland and wide surroundin "

we ate at lucca twice last week during a break near elburg. there were around 20 of us in the party and every single one of us left happy and satisfi 
a good coffee and very good service although they also do food - pleasant position by the harbour to watch the world go by.
"lucca is located in a converted warehouse just outside the old fortified city centre of elburg, overlooking the harbour. the renovated interior has a modern, spacious, yet warm and welcoming feel to it. we had dinner on a sunday evening after an active day outside. starters were good: fresh focaccia with olio & aglio, olive oil & balsamic vinegar and tasty home made pesto, and jumbo cerignola olives. main course for the kids was pizza, they were nicely done with beautiful crust. but the real treat of the evening were the proper italian dishes: mouth watering porcini and wild boar risotto. delicious aubergine with parmesan roast. and my favorite: filetto in a porcini & thyme sauce. best piece of meat i have had for a long time, straight from heaven! with roast potato, red beets and roast pumpkin on the side. feeling quite full by this point we still had to try some dessert and we werent disappointed again, with the tiramisu just right and a beautiful nutella & pistachio dessert topped with delicious hazelnut ice cream. all of this brought to us by fun and friendly servers... what more could you want. elburg is not around the corner from us, but im coming back for another dinner at lucca!"
nice italian bistro. great view of the lake. good selection of drinks.  nice place to have a relax afternoon. different type of chairs and lounge to choose from. i like the 2 funky chairs facing the water. good service. i will come back.
"we enjoyed a lovely lunch today at lucca restaurant in elburg. great coffee and we had the chefs surprise, the kids chose italian style sandwiches with chicken/carpaccio. friendly service, cosy ambiance. enjoy!"
"great to enjoy italian food, specially when the restaurant maintains the no pizza standard. so its the antipasto, a primo and a secundo and the dolce afterwards. great smooth carpaccio, antipasto misto followed by some filled pasta or straight & specials e.g. their special al tartufo. the menu changes each month so dont expect the real treat, rodlofos veal liver, the fegato veneziana, to be there, but boy, did i enjoy that! the rag√∫ we had was a bit dull, had it ten times better in bologna, but you cant win them all. great open wines, fine cakes. a bit on the pricy side, but friendly professional crew."
limoncello for everybody by the owner. no discrepancy by table .  gives more klantvriendelijkheid.  see you  next time
the service and food here are great.  i will not order from any other pizza restaurant.   delivery always hot and on time and delivered with a smile everytime!
great food not too expensive. enough on the menu to choose from. great atmosphere great service. had a good time. enjoyed it.
a fantastic 3 course menu with a fantastic steak of deer as the main course !! our first time pappagallo but for sure not our last. great and friendly staff that went out of their way to make our dinner night a more than total success!

"good food, great service, great italian menu 100 neapolitan chef! i hope to return soon.  i recommend it to all"
i was fascinated more by the process of making antipasti and enjoying the italian language - advantage of sitting at the bar. love the sphere here - piccola italia! cannoli tasted good and veeeery sweet.
"we arrived here at 3pm on a very hot saturday afternoon. the welcome was immediate and genuine. could we sit inside? no problem. gluten free? no problem, i will tailor things on request. our needs were anticipated even in 30c heat a real keenness to serve up something specia "
"the chefs wife is celiac, so he has gluten free in hand - no worries! excellent meal starting with antipasti (no gf bread - next time ill bring my own crackers), followed by a choice of fish, meat or pasta. we opted for the sharable beef which was cooked to perfection, accompanied with arugula&parmesan, grilled veg and side salad. simply fantastic. i had a limoncello for dessert - my husband passed on the tiramisu, but it looked to-die-for. excellent wine selection as well and service was impeccable. reminded us of the naples we remembered! cant wait to return!!!"

"i have visited this restaurant many times for lunch and dinner. i love the place especially when you can sit outside on the terrace at the back or at the bench in the front of the restaurant. whether you take a sandwich, pasta or meat/fish its always made with care and served with a smile. i personally like the pasta puttanesca the best. the portions are generous and if you take the full menu there is hardly any room for desert. however we always manage to finish it anyway, guess why;)"
"they serve the best italian food, all home-made and have great wines to pair your meal with. great staff too, it feels like a small piece of italian soil right in my own home-town"

"a family saturday lunch. just so special at this restaurant. the chef remembered our family from about 18 months back, and exactly how the girls enjoyed their carbonara. not on the menu, but made perfectly from scratch. really really worth a visit."
popped into my local italian deli/restaurant for a quick bite. had only been for coffee before: what a cool surprise. superb italian pasta and a wonderful garden. so good one on the herenstraat in oud-voorburg. mind you: open for dinner on thursday-saturday too :)
really enjoyed my icecream with a nice coffee on the outdoor terrace of zinn. located in the julianabaan shopping centre on a pleasant little circus. service friendly and prices altogether reasonable.
very tasty! you should try it once! in general next to the delicious ice cream variety one can find delicious cakes as well as interesting warm dishes!
"simply the best ice cream in the area!! we‚Äôve tried others, but this is the best! so creamy! such good flavors!!"
this place has a high quality standard and offers excellent coffee aways served with fresh whipped cream on the side and offers home made pastries as well as tarte flamb√©e for those of us who prefer salty dish 
cosy place in the middle of the central square in voorburg. go there for their excellent flammkuchen and friendly staff.
"okay, zinn is a really cute ice cream shop. you can sit and enjoy your ice cream inside or outside on the terrace. its a very happy cosy place in white and orange. service is with a smile, very nice! besides the most delicious ice cream ever, the serve illy coffee and espresso which is one of my personal favorites and small stuff to eat like toasties, paninnis, soep and poffertjes (organic) sort of like a one bite pancake. the presentation of the coffee, tea, and everything is really nice with just that bit of extra that makes it kind of festive. its really a wonderful place for lunch with ice cream for dessert, just ice cream, a snack, coffee or tea, glass of wine."
"i have been a regular of fratelli for a few years and it has never dissapointed. i apprecciate the excellent service, the kindness and permanent aim to make customers feel welcomed and well attended."
we come here often for take away. the pizzas are great with a good thin crispy crust. they also have a salmon lasagnato die for. kind and friendly staff.
"enjoyed a lovely dinner with family tonight at il tortellino. we enjoyed delicious salmon carpaccio, vitello tonato, mushroom risotto and cheese and walnut fresh tortellini out of the oven! highly recommend the place for a casual dinner or visiting the trattoria (same lovely italian owner next door) to enjoy the delicious meals at home! "
this is a nice little place to get carryout! we especially enjoyed their prosciutto pizza! their meatballs were quite tasty as well. give it a try!
we have been coming here for years.  the pizzas are delicious and very reasonably priced. service is always speedy.  the place could do with being renovated though as it is dark and dingy and looks like it hasnt been decorated for many many years.
"ordered another great takeaway pizza at this restaurant. when it comes to pizza, this restaurant is one of my favourites!"
"having tried quite some pizza restaurants in and around the hague, we decided to give fratelli a sho "
"always good for dinner. make sure to make a reservation, as they are always fully booked. food is great. good flavours, fresh ingredients, big portions, great value! staff is friendly and helpful. wines are tasty!"
service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good and the price/quality ratio is great. i could see myself getting takeout from here since the atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired.
despite being busy the three of us were given a warm welcome. we ordered off the menu and had a few drinks and still thought the total cost was very resonable. ambience 10+ service with a smile. if anything it seemed a little warm inside. there was always seats outside if it had bothered us too much:)
"my wife and i have visited voorburg once to three times a year for the last 20 years. one of our regular visits there is to fratellis restaurant, where we always receive a friendly welcome from the maitred and an excellent meal. the service is friendly and efficient, it is cosy without being cramped, and there is a good ranging wine list. starters are generous, the steaks are always excellent, and although there is a wide range of main courses we almost always plump for one of the steaks. a well-travelled italian friend came with us once and described it as the best value italian restaurant he has been to outside italy. i would heartily concur,"
this is probably one of the better medium priced restaurants in voorburg. the staff are accommodating even if the place is busy. at the weekend there could be larger parties so pre-booking is advisable. its possible to have a pre-dinner drink outside but seating is limited. may best to aim for a meal about 18:30 as the dutch tend to eat early.
after my son recommended to taste fratellis excellent pastas we went there with the family and i totally agree that their pastas are excellent
great food. great service. great pric 
"oddly enough for the past 15 years i stop here every time i go to holland to eat their pizza. i think it is one of the best in the world. the menu has many other wonderful choices. if youre in the area, i recommend you stop in. voorburg is also a nice little village."
"fratelli have several restaurants, but we like the one in voorburg the best. early in the evening a lot of families visit the restaurant so it can be busy with children. when you visit later it is usually more relaxed. food is always a good standard as is the service. it also possible to order pizzas for take-away, the pizzas are awesome and way better than dominos, new york pizza and other pizza deliberatie companies! prices are very reasonable. "
ive been coming here for at least the last 10 years. it is ideal for quick  dinner with small kids. bu sure to make a reservation in the weekend. the place is packed until 8:30.
our experience at fratelli was very good.. as a fan of italian food i would surely recommend it. the waiters were very nice. he recommended an appetizer for us and it was very tasty.. all our orders of pizza spaghetti lasagna soup appetizers and everything was tasty 
cosy little place with good food. calamari and pizza with a beer. olives to the table to get me started. nice window seat to watch the world go by. would return if back in the ar 
"surprisingly good pizza. delivered exactly on time and still hot. fair price. go for it. the salad was average, but our expectations for delivery salad are low."
"the restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere and the staff is overall friendly and helpful. they do not, however, always have the wines that you ask for. the food is of good quality, especially the pizzas. definitely, recommend it, but it would be smart to either reserve a table or go monday-thursday night, as friday-sunday nights tend to be extremely busy."
"good food n good service, well priced, helpful waiter, good pizza, good wine. you should try for dinner at this restaurant. good atmosphere as well."
"i know i am a bit too late to write a review about this restaurant, i visited this place during my holland visit in 2008, but i am writing this, believing, that its never too la "
"been awhile since i went back to donati. today was exceptionally good! maybe the chef was in a good mood today! had my usual spaghetti carbonara, and it was splendid today! taste was exquisite to the letter! also loved the calamari fritti before my main course!"
one of my favorite restaurants. always went with the spaghetti carbonara. service fantastic but make sure to reserve a table in advance if you go during peak hours and days.   today tried the warm molten choc cake too. awesome!
"at donati, the food is prepared with good, fresh ingredients. the flavors are good and the menu makes sense. service is very friendly and attentive. the wait staff are young but professional. the atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, it is laid back and lively but not too noisy. just right. i found the wines a little expensive, but overall our meal was reasonably priced, very tasty and very enjoyable. we will be back!"
"spaghetti was good for me. went there 3 times in a week! good location, car park easy. good atmosphere and good service too."
good (but not great) italian food in an uninspiring restaurant. interior needs some tlc (certain parts near the kitchen and toilets even look a bit tired 
what do you do when the sun shines and the temps is around 24c: you have your lunch on the roomy terrac 
"had a nice dinner here, friendly staff and a pleasant atmosphere. liked the tiramisu desert. surprisingly full for a wednesday evening üòÄ"
"donati is always a good option for a romantic dinner or a nice gathering with friends. the food is excellent, attention has always been payed to details, i particularly like all the raw and grilled fish and seafood dishes. the staff is also kind and friendly. i simply love this restaurant. "
"the atmosfeer in the restaurant is very nice. its not to busy and not to crowded. also the staff is very friendly. the menu is diverse and offers plenty of choice. nog too much, but just good.  i would definitely come back."
"yesterday wed had a small birthday celebration in this restaurant, 3 people in total. it was quite busy for a tuesday evening so i was happy id booked a table in advan "
"not at all what i expected from looking at the restaurant from the outside... a friend of mine booked it and i was very pleasantly surprised! the service was very friendly and good, warm atmosphere and and stylish furnishing and the italian food was very good. overall very good price-quality!"
"thank you very much for the nice evening and the delicious pizza. super service and beautiful premises, the store is also excellent."
"da tano is named after the italian chef and owner, we very much enjoyed the fresh italian dishes, the nice atmosphere and the sunny terrace in the lively centre of sassenheim."
"visited the historical city of ijsselstein. have been to this restaurant before and what a difference! the restaurant has been modernized, which has made it a lot more spaceous.   food was good, did not have to wait long. friendly staff."
this is an excellent restaurant with friendly sta 
every time i come for a meal at this awesome italian restaurant the service has never failed me. always friendly always eager to serve dont wait long for service or long for scrumptious italian meal. good going guys. really fantastic. will always come here for a meal. 
absolutely thrilled to have come across this coffee spot with delicious baked goods!  beats stopping at a gas station which was my plan. friendly service.
"even if you are in a hurry and already in your car, you can still have a slow handmade coffee on you way to the highway a2. just park at the carpool location in ijsselstein, and relax to tast real coffee with a warm heart."
you can drop by for a coffee to go (or stay) or order via de special leut-app when youre in a hurry. your order will be ready when you arrive.
i love these pizzas. they have a delivery service very fast. the pizza is perfect! i recommend this pizza shop.
"we visited this pizzeria in search for a quick dinner bite without a long wait. the pizzas were very large and tasted excellent. moreover, it was no problem to take the left-overs with you. only disadvantage is that they dont serve alcohol, hence no beer or wine to join your pizza ... many people came for a take-away which is well understood!"
"good food for a good price, nice personal nice menu. in the middle of the old part of houten nice terrace available under big trees"
we were here some time ago and went back and found this restaurant nicely renovat 
"nice place for dinner. the menu offers plenty of choices and prices are friendly. interior is nice, well decorated. the food is very well presented and good taste."
"it had been a while since i visited this place, but they maintained their high standard. they serve a very good 3 course choice menu offering the full a la carte menu for options. to accompany the dinner, they serve a fine selection of wines as well as beers, both on tap as well as bottle "
we always visit this restaurant whenever we cycle into the old town of hout 
was surprised to find a lovely restaurant like de roskam in the centre of old hout 
"the roskam is very well known because of its location, in the center of town, with a nice terrace where to enjoy a bit of sun with a glass of wine and some bitterballe "
the roskam has a modern look as well as a gezellig atmosphere. girls catching up in houten is fun too!
it is always a pleasure to visit de roskam on a sunny day youre welcomed at the terrace where you can dine or start your evening. coming inside you feel the cosy atmosphere knowing you will be treated well. there is quite a choice from the menu and the quality is very good. portions are more then sufficient and there is always a good companying wine available. the servants are friendly and are always there to help you when you need something special.
"great selection of beers in houten. a good place for having lunch with family and friends. by the way, their french fries is really crispy ;)"
"the pub atmosphere is relaxing, by there is a variety of menu options. there are choices for all tastes and the preferences. the staff is attentive and fun. it is a great choice for a dining experience."
"the food is great, tasteful and enough options to choose from.  they server all kinds of beers (over 80 types) so whatever you might like, they serve it."
"lovely little houten has a nice village square with some nice restaurants. de roskam deserves a visit. place has been modernized but still has the traditional easy-going atmosphere of an old family restaurant. non-pretentious food, good service and value for money. worth a try!"
"we ate at de roskam last wednesday evening after work. it is in a cobbled square in the centre of houten. as it was a sunny evening we decided to eat on the terrace and were lucky enough to have a large table outside. as the evening got late the overhead heater came on and an electric awning enclosed the terrace, so it was very comfortabl "
"i come her quite regularly with friends or family. a good price- quality rate, nice atmosphere, very clean, friendly service.  the restaurant and kitchen have been completely renewed quite recently. with other words, its a pleasure to visit this restaurant."
went here with my work colleagues for dinner. service was really good. very attentive and service focussed staff in the restaurant. good selection was good and food was cooked well and well presented. a pleasant evening
restaurant is located in the centre of houten. it was easy to park a car which is great advantage. food was really delicious. athmosphere in the restaurant really pleasant. staff competent and friendly. make sure you make a reservation if you go here on the weekend.
this was one of the best pizzas (and tiramisu) i‚Äôve had for a long time! again compliments to the pizza chef! i will definitely come back as the place and atmosphere are fantastic and the food superb!
"it was a real pleasant experience to visit nonna‚Äôs. sweet staff, amazing food, cool atmosphere üáÆüáπüáÆüáπüçïüçΩüçù"
we had pizza take out from this restaurant. it was really good and ready in 10 minutes! a really thin base and generous toppings. i had a spicy salami pizza and my husband had a tuna pizza. it was just as good the next morning when i heated up my left overs for breakfa 
had an excellent crispy pizza here from a wood-fired oven that occupies a major part of the rear of the restaurant. i intended to have a pasta but i found the menu limited so opted for a pizza instead. the pasta of the week is an extra to the menu though. the place is smallish; on an unannounced visit on a weekday we had the last vacant table.
lovely restaurant on a charming little square with free parking. a fee tables outside. nice menu with plenty of choice. friendly staff and owner. lovely desserts!
"the food is delicious, the service is excellent and the prices are good.the pizza is the best one i have had at that time. my impressions are very nice."
this is truly one of the best italian restaurants in this area.  their food is delicious and their prices are good.  service is phenomenal.
"we moved to the netherlands from belgium and have been going here a couple times a week all through summer. the ice cream is great especially lemon pie, pistachio and coffee (although i wouldnt combine those). scoop size is heavily dependent on the employee (and they seem to have a lot of different ones). overall, highly recommend."
"hands down, my favorite restaurant in veenendaal (and i have visited the majority of the restaurants here at least once "
"we every now and then pop in to this little restaurant in a not so obvious location in veenendaal. we really like the italian food, the fact that they change the menu with the season (certainly autumn is our my favourite, for eating game). kitchen is mostly southern tirol oriented. very good, tasty food and good portions. also very nice wines available, as also very nice desserts (like the strawberry tiramis "
this was probably the last sunny & hit day of summer 2019. we spontaniously decided to have dinner here. we had a nice (large) table outside. the staff is very friendly. there is a lot to choose from on the menu: from meat to pasta & pizza. you can even order a pizza with a choice of your own ingredients. the menu holds appox. 10 differents sorts of deser 
"whenever we‚Äôre looking for great italian food, we visit this place (or arrange for take-away). has been our favourite for many many years. we‚Äôre particularly fond of calzone and quatro formaggi. they have expanded and have a nice terrace too."
a quaint litte italian restaurant with an actual italian as an owner. great food and good service. the pasta was delicious.
very good italian food. no english menu but waitress was very helpful. great service and very friendly.
so good that eating out is possible again. we really enjoyed a generous pork filet and a most tasty pizza.
"walked past this place many times but only visited first time this week with family. we all went for pizza and they were amazing - just right, crispy thin crust not too much tomato sauce . we got some nice warm bread to start with for free, which was a real nice gesture. pizzas are big so i didn‚Äôt have space for dessert but some in our party did and they liked them a lot. service was also very good "
"great flavours, excelent service, fiendly atmosphere. i recomend the mango flavour and the limoncello."
"this place is located in the dennenlaan, next to bakery nieuwburg. it offers outside seating, very good ice cream of all sorts and very friendly service. worth a visit."
"good food good prices,friendly service,very helpful the menu in english,,it was clean,we order a hawaiian pizza"
"very pleasant pizza cafe in zwanenburg. excellent friendly service menu also includes english translation. we ordered the soup of the day (onion soup), pizza (no 29) and the house red wine. they brought out some olives, and warm bread, yum. good food, wine and company and enjoyed the passing views. "
good food and reasonably priced.  the service is excellent and there is a decent variety in the menu.
"its in the middle of nowhere, so we didnt have a lot of options, but it was a good experience. the waitress was super friendly, a sweet mother. olives and bread were served beforehand, nice. the pizza was fast and good."
"we had a lovely dinner here. they put us in the corner of the restaurant so the other guests wont mentioned us a lot. the food was nice, acceptable price"
a fine italian restaurant that served very good tasty pizza. if one craved for a very good one la brocca wont make you down.   i can recommend this to any everyone.
wonderful place with marvelous intetior. perfect salad minestrone pasta pizza and dolci. very authentic and friendly service. best italien restaurant around. we love it and will return as soon as possibile....
"a small cosy restaurant and an owner that wants to serve you fast, though once he figured out that we were in for the full monty and a junior waiter took over things improved. we were there for dinner and that was really good, makes sure you have a good at desert !"
"the pizza is great, but everything else is even better. love the atmosphere and owner jorgos is always a great host. dont miss the desserts!"
"the head waiter is a bit boisterous but the food is very nice and not very expensive. the place is small and often crowded, so do reserve! we live close by and have visited the place quite a few times over the years, always consistent."
italian food simply prepared and always served hot . i have eaten here several times and always receive a warm welcome
"looked for somewhere within easy walking distance of our hotel (ibis styes) so tried here and we were not disappointed. we were fortunate to get a table on easter sunday and it was obvious that the restaurant was very popular with locals, which tells a story. delicious food, i had the fish chowder, then tagliatelle with salmon and the tiramisu to finish. very friendly, helpful staff who added to our overall wonderful experience."
"loved this place. very busy, cosy and crowded - lovely atmosphere with families, couples etc. my calzone pizza was first class. offers a take away service."
"this is a lovely traditional restaurant that although small has a very friendly and intimate feeling that adds to a family atmosphere. the menu is varied and the food delicious. i had lamb, beautifully cooked and a huge starter of prawns which was delicious. carafes of good wine completed the experience. highly recommended."
"i had finished 600 km of driving, i was tired and hungry, but also very sweaty. the trattoria was completely full and many people waited outside, standing. i said to the waiter; im hungry, im a courier and i havent eaten all day. he invited me inside, offered me to drink and gave me the menu. i chose a pizza napoli to take away. they offered me drinks and they wanted to offer pizza too and i didnt accept it, because we are among decent workers. inside there are my sardinian and neapolitan brothers, the pizza was delicious and the scent that came out of the kitchen reminded me of the dishes cooked with love and passion, as the real made in naples should be. do not miss this place, you eat very well and cheap. they manage to make everyone smile, even the most depress "
fabulous italian food and great service. visited with friends who recommended it and would recommend it to anyone. thank you so much for a superb evening!
very kind host and a nice old italian vibe. the terrace is heeted in winter but if youre not close to the heaters it can still be a bit cold.
"having pizze/lasagne and vino on a sunny day has been wonderful. even if the terrace outside was overloaded, we got a place at the window inside, even better with airco on a hot day. pizze very crusty, great peppery sauce made specially for us on request through a very charming lady from south sardegna serving us. wonderful dining experience at a fair price, recommended!"
"went for a dinner for my birthday with the family. august, so we could sit outside under roof. the food was execellent, very tasty real italian. the service was very friendly and quick. we enjoyed our night out and my birthday was a succes."
during our stay in castricum we ate 2 times in this restaurant. our visit was ones around 5:30pm and the other visit was around 8pm. both times the restaurant was busy: a good sig 
what can i say? a faultless meal that we enjoyed from beginning to end. we were very hungry so we had a lot to eat! we got some olives and lovely bread to nibble on and then starters and pasta. seafood pasta was lovely - very fresh. i would say food very simple but all the better for that. really good flavours. and helpful staff.
"on the final stop of a month long tour of the netherlands, we stumbled upon this gem of an authentic italian trattoria in castricum, serving the best italian food ive eaten outside of my 3 trips to bella ital "
"the pasta parmigiana is worth a trip to the small town of castricum. whiskey is poured into a round of parmigiana, then lighted to melt the cheese. when melted enough, the pasta is added and mixed with the cheese. the result is a spectacularly rich and delicious dish. well be back for more . . . after weve worked off this one."
"together with my wife and my kid (4 years old) we were driving around and we stopped in castricum. it was fun we noticed this italian restaurant you would never think to find far away from big cities, well, we do not use to eat italian abroad but actually it was not like eating abroad because this is a proper italian restaurant. excellent food, friendly people, they did everything possible to make our experience great. congratulation to the chef and to all the team. we will come back!"
we were on one of our spontane trips to europe when we find ourselves in this small dutch town castricum.. a bit chilly to walk around in the evenings we took refuge to the warm and cozy atmosphere of la trattoria.. alex the chef owner and ugras our maitre de made us feel like in a small mediterrenean village with sincere and genuine service. i would definitely recommend this cute restaurant to whom wants to have an authentic trattoria experience in castricum..
i am italian and casually found this restaurant in a small town next to amsterdam. i was attracted by the napoletan accent of 2 waiters in front of the door and decided to stop for a dinne 
quaint little canalside b&b and cafe. we had tea and bitterballen followed by apple tart with cream. outside it is soft seating with cushions and blankets if you need them. inside is wooden tables with antique crockery and cutlery. it is adorned by a lifetimes collection of antique ornaments and pictures. 
it was really a good experience..italian style food mixed with dutch style...perfect high quality combination...you can relax and have a perfect dinner with a very friendly service....the combination between the style and the food create a perfect atmosphere...suggested!
"we visited the restaurant once more and once again enjoyed what i would like to call the serving of a wonderful meal with a human touch. not just customer friendly, but a real human touch that you experience in the interaction with the staff and in the tasting of the food. a real joyful experience in an intimate atmosphere!"
lovely place with home made food. weve visited this place during our happen en trappen trip. this was the place to receive soup and weve received a lovely home made bowl of soup. dietary restrictions are well met and taken care of. good place to go. 
on christmas day we had dinner at this lovely place. small and intimate. especially the service was excellent. the standard menu for this evening was adapted so that those of us who werent keen on fish were served an alternative. we have been to this restaurant a couple of times before and it has always been a joy! very personal treatment at a very reasonable price.
we took the 4 course truffle menu. all 4 courses were very good.  service was very attentive and fast.  wines by glass are very good.  to be recommended.
"dining at this suberp trattoria is a real treat. original and tasty dishes, all topped off with excellent service  close your eyes and you are in italy!"
"excellent carbonara, good calzone! decor was tasteful and cosy, wine and beer were reasonably priced. overall, excellent value and would certainly return."
"because of mothers day i treated my mother to dinner. the ambiance of trattoria aglio e olio makes you feel like eating in italy. great service, nice food and good italian music."

"great atmosphere, excellent food and food presentation, great service, very familiar. a must go place when you are in the area."
"we had a nice dinner. very good service, good pizza and pasta. wine was a bit expensive but certainly a place to go!"
"authentic italian cooking, everything was fresh and tasty. very friendly staff. definitely  come here again!"
"ok, this is something i really love! what a restaura "
it was so heart-warming even to arrive here. nice staff and the interior even makes it better to feel yourself like in an italian familys house for a dinner. everything was sooo fresh and tasty. it was the best italian i have ever been outside of italy for sure. maybe if i count the italian ones ive been in this one is still beat them. definitely a place to visit again!
"this restaurant is touching on a higher level of italian quisine. yes they do have the obligatory pizza and pasta; but you should really go for the more sofisticated menu. great food at a decent price ,little upmarket but fine value for mo "
we stopped at asten for one night. looked at trip adviser for places to eat and decided to go for italian food. as we walked in we thought the restaurant is empty but they have back garden or rather back yard but in nice italian style and atmosphere. that was on a very warm eve so we enjoyed every minute. prices are fair for what you get. btl of house wine is just under 20‚Ç¨ - in fact white is very nice; and main course you can have for about 10‚Ç¨ for pasta and pizza or 15‚Ç¨ +for fish/meat dishes. what is more important the food is delicious and staff very friendly and made all effort to communicate with us:)
i live in dubai and i never (seriously never) eat italian outside because i know for sure i will be disappointed. also i was wondering who would appreciate italian home made food in the middle of the netherlands.. well now am wondering who wouldn 
very nice people serving good italian food. the wine that i served is a good quality wine. the prosecco we can recommedate. ouside in a lovely cousy city garden you can eat. simply good and reasonable priced.
"looking for a place to eat in a small town is not always easy. i saw 5 reviews in a foreign language that i dont speak. i gave it a try on just the ratings. yes, its a real find. good wait staff, great italian fo "
"didn‚Äôt really know what to expect, but what a wonderful surprise, attention to detail was incredible, wonderful staff catering to your every need, good wine card, food was incredible, the attention we received made us feel very special, definitely going back, thank you danny rene and your team"
we asked to our b and b where is it possible to eat at 8p 
"i found this restaurant by chance. i am italian and i am always very curious to find out the way our typical food and products are cooked in other countries. my dinner at innesto left me speechless. an extremely varied menu, sensitive respect for italian traditional dishes which are reproduced in a surprising, pleasing way. at innesto you can definitely taste quality and have an unforgettable meal. the staff is young, nice and friendly, they made me feel at home. i highly recommend this restaurant to all kinds of clients, of all ages and nationalitie "
"nice atmosphere, great dishes and friendly staff. not only the restaurant, but also a great place for venues like a wedding. absolutely fabulous!!"
"very nice original italian food, very friendly service, good wines, cosy atmosphere, lovely terrace outside"
we attended a wedding party here .the restaurant did a really professional job serving the gues 
had a great meal here enhanced by our charming waiter;  the lovely lady chef even drove us back to our b&b - thats service!
i ate 3 dinner here.  great service and delicious meals.  the staff were first class and helpful with suggestions and recommendations.
"had the very tasty 3 course meal for less than eur 25,- . good choise !! my partner had the asperagus √† la brabantse way , which were exelently boiled and served . "
"i dined here when staying in the bw hotel next to it. they have a seasonal menu (not sure why end march they presented the winter menu, but ok), but also a la carte choic "
very friendly and good quality tasty food. i only had a main course and a desert. everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. certainly worth visiting.
it was my first visit to this restaurant. i was in the center of bergeijk looking for somewhere nice to eat. my i fell on the italian looking name. it looked clean from the outside with some people eating. so i went in and was surprised by the place. i had only the maincourse because i didnt have much time. i chose the seabass. it was very fresh and tasty. friendly and fast service. fully enjoyed it. will surely visit again.
"we eat here very often as it‚Äôs a lovely local italian, fresh ingredients, simple and not too heavy. the staff are very friendly and super accommodating and will adapt dishes when needed. they even always bring a lovely little amuse bouche! worth a visit!"
"we were there for camping and we went out for dinner due to someones birthday and we are all italian food lover, so we found this one. review says its good and we tried already once, they were fully booked (that is why we knew it should be good as in such small town, food much be good to be fully booked for dinner still!). the food we all had are really good; if you put the reults of michelin star restaurants, this restaurant purely bring you simply good food, simple but good service; nothing else. if you are a good food lover, you would enjoy as much as we do. you must try it if you are in the neighborho "
"it was our fourth visit to this wonderful restaurant and every single visit we have been ecstatic ! i started with a delicious home made bouillon and my husband had coquilles with parma ham. as a main, we both had the saltimbocca. the taste was very italian (having lived in italy we know what that means !) and extremely tasty. we ended with their excellent coffee, although we were very tempted by their desserts, but alas, age is creeping up on as, so we try to watch our calories ! this was all delivered with a natural elegance, attention and kindness in a very pleasant setting, the latter especially now they have added their wonderful (non-smoking) conservatory."
"found ourselves in bergeyk unexpectedly and did a quick check on tripadvisor to find somewhere to eat. pleased we chose buon gusto, it was a really nice location on the edge of a market square. good range on the menu. pasta dishes looked great from what we saw of other peoples. we had veggie lasagna and victoriabaars (nile perch apparently, not something ive ever had before) - both were excellent. nice wine and beer. no kids menu - my daughter only wanted soup anyway so this wasnt a problem. i think they would have done a small portion of a main meal if wed asked. friendly service. only complaint was that we asked for desert at 10pm only to be told that, although they were still serving drinks, the kitchen was closed! would have been nice to know that earlier."
dropped in for an evening meal on a quiet sunday evening. the service was friendly and attentive. the food was delicious and the decor/ambience pleasant. best restaurant in the area by far.
"great dedicated chef, friendly service in a small restaurant on a lovely square in the town centre. i had one of the most delicious chicken dishes. my husband had the rack of lamb which he much appreciated. it was accompanied by a few stir fried (?) veg and a great risotto. their wines are excellent and many of these organic. good fresh coffee ! this was our second visit and obviously we will be back."
"overall very nice concept and tasty food (is my 3rd visit here). my absolute favorite is the mexican buffet followed by the steakhouse and the italian (which is totally nothing even close to italian but hey the pizzas are ok). there is also a very excellent desserts buffet, probably the best i have ever had in an all you can ea "
"this new location has a spacious setup. more room to sit compared to the location in velp. the food is what you can expect quality wise from a buffer restaurant. there is mexican, fastfood, italian, chinese, a bakery, fish, steakhouse. so there is something for everyone. the food is good. just hope to have a little bit of a busy evening so the food is replaced often."
"very friendly and professional staff who explained the concept of this amazing restaurant, so much choice of freshly prepared quality hot and cold foods from around the world, as much as you can eat, we were so impressed and had a lovely evening, wonderful desserts, ices, cotton candy, cakes, waffles, pancakes, bottomless soft drinks and teas coffees, huge array of different varieties, we hope to visit again and wish you all the very best for your restaurant. would love to see this in uk ."
"i live near, so every time its my turn to cook, its star-time!! delicious pizzas. they are specialized in calzones: check them out!"
"i‚Äôve been here once and it‚Äôs really delicious, especially the pizzas have an amazing taste and there is not to much cheese on it. love this place!!"
"my first time ordering takeaway for delivery in the netherlands. ordered via the local version of justeat website and paid by credit card. everything went very well, receipt emailed to me, order was delivered to my door in a reasonable time and was certainly very hot - the carrier devices they use seem very go "
"raaaaaah this munch was most devious. some proper italian stallion skran. mandem arrived and the donnys put some meat and bread down before a word was even ushered man felt like royalty. man ordered a beer and it came bare cold like the north pole and dat. these mandem, gyaldem and theydem bare technological and whip out the ipad if u want wine. got man perplexed at the variety of drank. man ordered the pesto ting and the meal was volcanic, bare hot man be careful out here or u will lose a bud or two init. menu lil lacking variety but still got some villainous munch, wallet didnt enjoy it but man did. no paigons in sight either the bossmen, gyaldem and theydem were bless. big up."
"worth going, great authentic food, so not a dutch version of italian dishes. very pleasant spacious indoor tables and large outdoor area. the service was very pleasant, the food yummy, simply a wonderful experience. definitely worth coming back to and deserves to be in the michelin guide!"
"one of the more authentic italian restaurants i have been to in the netherlands (being an italian myself)  great dinner, good quality ingredients, nice and friendly service, nice ambience and well spaced out tables.  would definitely return !"
"an hour away from where we live, but every time its totally worth it. the staff couldnt be better and the chefs skills are simply outstanding. pure top quality ingredients delivering your moneys worth!"
we went already at 18.00pm and only had two hours because of the babysit. they offered us a very nice 3-course dinner and the service was really good. we love to bring a visit in the new accommodation.
"such an enjoyable evening. chic decor, friendly welcome & service. food delicious as always and no rush. if you want a relaxed dinner, time to talk and enjoy good food & wine there‚Äôs no better pla "
"i have been here on multiple occasions and the food and ambiance have always been superb! the pasta is excellent and always fresh, just as the vegetables, which are by the way picked from their own garden! also their secondis (meat/fish plates) are impeckable, same goes for their desserts (you should have the merenque - flawless "
decided to eat here with some friends after reading the review 
"i have really enjoyed our sunday night visit to pasta e vino: the service was impeccable, the hosts very welcoming, prepared and friendly (i was surprised by the knowledge of the waiter about the nonino grappas! actually, i was surprised they even had them there :)  "
fabulous experience. had a super meal in a fantastic atmosphere. friendly service and casual with class and style. loved the laughter og the waitress/owner:-)

"one of the most amazing place ive experienced in my gourmet life! imagine a posh village in limburg, close to a nice church, the most authentic-modern italian restaurant you can imagin "
we had a family meal in this restaurant and staff went out of their way to make the evening a memorable one! the kids food was tailored to their likings and they even got dishes that were not on the menu. advice on wine was excellent as these wines were amongst the nicest weve ever had! will definitely return here!!!
"we are americans living in beek for a couple of years and we kept hearing that we should check out this restaurant. so i booked a table for 10 for my birthday in july and it was fantastic! great italian food, great wine and slightly pricey but totally worth it. there are not too many restaurants i have liked in the nl so this is pretty high praise from me ;). its great for a romantic evening or a special occasion and we had great service (also rare!). we hope to go back! (i wish i would have taken more pictures!)"
we have been visiting pasta e vino frequently for over 20 years . only the fact that we still look out for a next occassion is enough to make it our favorite italian in the southern netherlan 
"a really great place for home wood oven made pizzas and more. we ate ossobuco which was excellent and the side dishes too. fresh pasta was also nice. the staff is more the accommodating so a great stay. price for value is also excellent, much more then maastricht !"

"went out for dinner with our company (large group) at il trattamento. we shared the meals family style. great selection of starters, followed by various pizza, pasta and finally a dessert. waitresses are friendly, with food and drinks coming round pretty quick. tiramisu was delicious! we‚Äôll be back..."
"came here for a dinner with my family. all dishes (pastas and pizzas) were delicious and, despite it being a full house, service and staff were quick and very helpful. for dessert we had a very nice tiramisu and upon leaving we all got a free limoncello which was home made and extremely tasty. i can highly recommend you try th "
"superb food in an astonishing environment with friendly hosting, it is a must to visit this restaurant."
"good atmosphere with kind service, family owned with a chef having great feeling for italian style of preparing food"
took a party of seven in desperation for a fee 
"pizzas with taste! from even the most simple ones for the children to the top of the range versions. the taste of all ingredients stand next to each other due to their freshness and doses. each desert that we had, tingled the tastebuds. all was fingerlickin go "
this italian restaurant was recommended by our b&b hostess. we immediately noticed it was extremely busy however there simply were not enough wait staff to adequately serve all the tables. wait time for our soup and main course was quite long. my sister ordered her beef medium rare and came almost well done. my risotto was not fully cooked. the arborio rice was still crunchy. the flavor however was really good. the tiramisu was exceptional.
easy accessible. lovely food.  good service  friendly staff. would recommend to pre book as it‚Äôs a very busy place.
"the food was really good, we had the 4-courses meal and they could change it for me because it had seafood and i dont like it, it was very nice! and the dessert was delicious! but the waiting time between courses was long, at least 45min... i recommend if you want good italian food and you are not in a hurry."
the food was fresh and excellent. there was a great selection of wines. it was outstanding meal! the waitress spoke english.
we visited this restaurant twice in one week - on both occasions fabulous food! it was great to sit outside and to soak up the summer sunshine while enjoying good food. best to book as it gets busy. service is a bit slow so make sure you are prepared to wait for your food. it is worth it in the end! it is well worth a visit when in the area.
visited this restaurant to celebrate a birthday. this was our first but definitely not last visit - we are new to the ar 
this restaurant we recomanded by friends of us. we went on a sunday evening and we ate the menu tartuf 
"family orientated service. everything is possible, split dishes, extra portion etc. great filets mignon from the grill and a choice of sauces."
came here by coincidence. what a nice restaurant in a little village like this. i had one of the best fish soups i ever h 
great italian restaurant. been there a few times and will go again. the food is delicious and service always nice. the place is very popular so book in advance. we usually book but once we didnt and were turned away on a tuesday evening!
"first class menu, service and staff.    they will cater for a table of 2 or ive seen up to 24. all are served with the same service"
"large terrace for the warm evenings, spacious interior, nice crew. but most imprtant: the food is very good. is obvious the chefs are italian. we had the risotto with white truffles (mmm!) and scallops. very nice."
"this italian brasserie was for 18 years located in horn, a village nearby, but recently the owners moved to this previous townhall. after only 8 months they already received more than 20000 gues "
good ice cream while being a walk on a sunny day in vaals right at the dutch/german border! we love the cookie & cream.
"ijssalon italia has the best home made ice cream in the area. the place is very popular in summer, but is busy even in the winter months. ice cream, coffee, chocolate milk, mulled wine, and soups. worth a visit if you are in the area!"
the restaurant is best known for its ice cream. there is a great selection of flavours and all delicio 
perfect place for a home made ice cream. we had the coupe krokant and it was excellent.  service is friendly.
nice ice cream shop with great icecream.  . enormous choice and quick service. neat interior but classy. just before bordercrossing to germany. many germans but also many locals. always busy. recommended.
"dropped in without reservation with no problems. its cost and with good service. not expensive at all, 100‚Ç¨ for 3 adults and 3 teenagers with mains and dessert. also has a nice outside terrace."
good food with nice atmosphere. friendly people. had a great evening. we ate pizza pasta and had good house wine.
"as others have said, we were not expecting to enjoy such a good meal in this lovely garden, from the outside it might deceive you but once youre in, its definitely worth it. the pizza i ordered was one of the best ive had in the netherlands and my family was also very satisfied with their choices."
nice food and top class service. definitely not expensive. i highly recommend this restaurant. they helped us with everything with a smile.
we didnt expect to find such a delightful garden to enjoy our pizza in! this was the best pizza we have ever eaten! service was also tops! we hoped to eat once more there but it is closed on a monday :(
great food good presentation attention to detail lovely service value for money i would definitely go here again to eat
"i enjoy every time when we go to this italian restaurant. there not many tables in the main restaurant, so reservation is recommended. it is an italian restaurant they serve what you normally get in a pizzaria, but what you get is very good. the atmosphere is nice and cosy. you will not be dsiappointed."
"we had √† great dinner again. the restaurant is run by 2 brothers.  try the special house cocktail, the viola. the mixend salad is fantastic. the pizza is fabulous. very friendly service.."
"vaals is a small town in the south of the netherlands, but they offer a few very nice restaurants. we went to this place nearby our hotel after we made a reservation based on some very good revie "
"we had dinner here and the food and service are amazing. food is delicious and fresh, generous portion too. we had dinner at the little courtyard at the back, beautiful!"
"excellent pizza and salads , good service , clean , nice decoration , friendly waiter and the prices are fair . i can only recommend it if you stay in vaals or nearby"
"i enjoyed a very nice pizza at della mamma. the service is personable and very friendly. the tiramisu was really tasty too. for non pretentious and nice tasting italian food, della mamma is the place"
arrived late as the restaurant was preparing to close. we were welcomed in and enjoyed a lovely meal. 2 pizzas - huge and tasty! and i had the delicious trio of lasagnes. warm and cosy on a freezing evening. house wine good - and whole bill so reasonably priced. highly recommended if you are in the area - hope to go back again before we leave.
"for starters, do not miss the chance to go here. we had a marvelous evening due to the impressive meal and the excellent wine pairings but that is not all. it was clear from the start that i was not in the driving seat here. just sit, relax and enjoy the show. this is a place that revels italian cooking and viniculture and that is where this place excels. the owner loves his wines and knows them and that shows. it is great to see someone passionate about wines, his place and cooking. this is a mom-pop business , and currently they may / can serve 10 people on a given evening. there is one menu with paired wines, i haven‚Äôt seen the winelist (remember not in the driving seat) but trust that there ample of choices. could not agree more with an earlier ta review ‚Äúdining here is not a meal, its an event.‚Äù"
"this is one of the best resto‚Äôs in the southern part of limburg. chef monique and dario start with a friendly and personal reception. we had the round table. nice! then the surprises follow each other in a nice order. food is delicious, starting with the olive variations. super! the wineselection by dario for every course makes everything top! the wildboar was superb. and the predessert and dessert show the magnificent culinary arts of chef moniqu "
this was my 3rd visit and again schatull impressed  
the taste of the different plates where always good and sometimes surprising.  we were warmly welcomed by the owner/waiter.  at the end of the evening the women received a rose to take home.  recommended but be sure you have enough time.
"we had a great evening at schatull. the food was excellent, as were the wines. there was an abundance of starters, each as nice as the other. very clear the cook loves food and likes to share. the restaurant itself is quite small (which we tend to like) so plenty attention from staff. we will definitely come again."
third visit and again a fun experience. no idea what was said by the owner but we let the food speak for itself. go and enjoy.
i was a positive surprise to find a restaurant serving this high standards in va 
was a little surprised on a bank holiday weekend there were only a few tables taken. i have no idea why as the food is excellent and the service too. you really need to speak italian or dutch although a little english is spoken too. time and effort has been taken here to prepare the food and you know it when you taste it. presentation is pure entertainment
finally we went to schatull. it was my husbands birthday so we went on a thursday. there was 1 other table of 2 and a group of appr. 15 people. everything from start to finish was great. the food was delicious and the wines really complimented the food. we would recommend this place to everybody who really enjoys going out for dinner and be a bit spoile 
its becoming a tradition to dine im schatull at the start or end of our summer holida 
we had a 5 course surprise dinner with wine arrangement. at first we got several tastefull appetizers. and then started the great 5 course italian adventure. every dish was a picture and tasted delicious. the accompanied wines also were great. it was almost as if we were in italy. we will certainly go back there soon!
"this restaurant serves real italian food. de cook is dutch, her husband is from florence and kwos a lot about great italian wines. a good combination!"
"our family spent 5 nights at the kasteel bloemendhal hotel and we were so appalled at the service by the restaurant and staff that we decided to dine in this italian restaurant across the road from the hotel........the dining experience and food was so good we went there twice more.......the owners thea and sjaak are the owners and wilma is the server and each one greets you with a beaming smile and a real sense of friendliness that the restaurant staff in the hotel are somewhat lacking. we have tried three different choices from the menu and each time the food has been superb. each meal is freshly prepared and so tasty and piping hot that you would be hard to find better in italy .....or anywhere else actually. also the price, it is very reasonable too which is an added bonus. but what makes this establishment so good is the warm welcome and attentiveness of the staff........thank you for making our holiday that much better because we really pressed for dining options at the hotel. (a review of our stay at the hotel will be posted on the hotel so "
"we have stayed in vaals 3 nights (hotel incl. 2 dinners) and had dinner here one evening. it was quiet around 21h00 monday evening. we could sit on the terrace. later on the lady asked if we wished another table because there in the corner it was a bit less windy. very kind. food was very good. we had al forno dishes. for me it was very nice but too much. so, you can ask a smaller portion, the owner told me. a nice and good suggestion. i dont if we would return to vaals or neighbourhood, but if we should, we would return to bellissima !"
casual italian with really good food. the people that work there are super friendly. i had the lasagna it was really good and i would come back here again.
"nice restaurant, very clean and light , delicious food , very good service. they have everything on the menu you expect in a pizzeria and a nice choice of wine ."
ate here one evening whilst on holiday and we were really impressed with everything about this restaurant. the pizzas and lasagne were amazing and the staff really friendly. although it was very quiet it has a lovely atmosphere and was decorated really well with beautiful lighting. would definitely recommend a visit.
"found on google maps whilst staying in a nearby hotel. what a find. extensive menu, much more than pizza and pasta. my curried chicken was amazing. husband had chicken skewers, so tender. being a rural area we struggled with language spoken and written menu but the staff were super helpful. massive portions and good value "
"before we moved, we ate here regularly and every time we are in the area again and can sit on the terrace, we like to repeat it. in fact, dogs are not allowed in the restaurant but are allowed on the terrace. and since we always travel with our little dogs, this is important to us. our last visit had apparently been a while ago because, to our pleasant surprise, the terrace had been refurbished and fitted with cosy elements. it all looked many times cozier and definitely contributes very positively to the whole dining experience. the food was delicious. i always find the carpaccio a bit watery and the addition of iceberg lettuce is mi unnecessary but my romaine skewer was delectable. the meat was perfectly grilled and the gorgonzola sauce will always be a favourite. the pasta always has an aftertaste that i am not a fan of. probably traced back to the spice mix used or perhaps the broth in which the pasta was cooked. no idea; the chef wont say and thats fine. just no more pasta for me. our waitress was friendly and extremely helpful. kudos to her for that. next time when we are in the area (and can sit outside) we would love to come again for dinner!"
"we dined here with 10 members of my dutch family and my english husband recently. the restaurant is not large but has a warm ambience and staff are very welcoming. my husband was given an english menu. we had the mixed grill which consisted of tenderloin, prime rib and fillet steak served with salad, fried or chipped potatoes with a choice of sauces and it was delicious. for afters we had dame blanche and tiramisu. everyone had different meals but were equally enthusiastic about quality and quantity and prices. definitely worth repeati "
"this restaurant is the only italian in heelsum. it has delicious pizzas (also vegetarian ones!). i have not tried yet other type of food here. they have now a terrase, which makes it more interesting especially in the summer mont "
"mostly very busy, but they do find space to seat you. especially since they have expanded. the food is honest and good value for money. the service is friendly and fast. we always enjoy this place as a quick alternative for a home cooked meal."
for italian food in a small village with almost no restaurants this a really decent italian place where they use fresh ingredients to prepare you pizza in a good oven.
"when my friend went in to make a reservation i figured id been there before and yes, that appeared to be the case. this time we sat inside and were met by a very friendly young man. the menu was varied and the prices very decent. the dishes we ordered were delicious and well presented. the place has a warm and relaxed atmosphere and nothing seems to be too much trouble. i would go back there - yet again :-) - wthout hesitation."
"we had already eaten in another village, but on the way back to our hotel we stopped at op de brink for some late-night desser "
"stepped onto the terrace late on a warm september evening looking for something to eat. though the kitchen was about to close it wasnt any trouble serving us the meal we liked to order. and there was plenty of it and very tasteful, accompanied by a very nice glass of wine. owner/manager was very friendly and pleasant, prices were very decent and we didnt have to go to bed on an empty stomach :-)"
went here for a birthday meal. little more expensive then the usual italian but they justify it by providing elevated italian dishes. the selection of 5 italian appetizers is especially great.
"the food was very delicious but it took a long time before it came, but it is definitely recommended"
food was delicious and although some reviews said service was slow (and it is a bit slow) it was definitely worth the wait. will definitely come back
"nice terrace, cozy inside with a couple of bigger tables. next to the obligatory pizzas theres also a lot of other choices. also a vast choices of wines."
"to start of with the positive, the food and athmospere are very good. they claim to be ‚Äúnot the average italian‚Äù and live up to that promi "
"been there with family and friends, excellent italian food, excellent service, even they were about to close they serviced us superbly and patiently. great gluten free pizza and pasta"
"a beautiful 1st day of august 2018. with two highly experienced and knowledgable food critics we challenged the asian executive chef to surprise us with the finest he has on the menu in italian dining. starting with a unique amuse in the form of an √≠ced drink consisting of clear tomato- and watermelon juice spiced with dash of red pepper and served in a stemless cocktail glass on a bed of crushed ice. an excellent refreshing start for lunch on a very hot day. next a smashing presentation of excellently prepared coquilles, served on a mirror of turnip cabbage puree, accompanied by crispy cauliflower flowers, slowly cooked leg of octopus and a finishing touch of lobster bisque froth. the main course a lovely variant of the classic tournedos rossini, mini-filet mignon with an excellent cuisson of duck foie-gras, sliced summer truffel, on a very tasty polenta crust & green asparagus and accompanied with a marvellously flavoured reduction of jus-de-veau, madeira wine and truffled with il mondo del tartufo white winter truffle butter. the apotheoses a composition of lemon sherbet, marinated/lightly sauted pineapple, crumbs, a friable of pineapple and the sauce of the marinade. all dishes accompanied by fabulous selected wines. from the local prosecco till the very fine italian white and red wines and a marvellous desert wine. an exceptional culinair/gastronomic experience. thank you albert/jimmy and your disciplined crew. we will certainly will be back again."
we had lunch with albertos. it is a rather new sqare with old looking buidlings. we had lunc on the terrace. it is a pleasnt view. we had a bread lunch with some drinks. it al tasted very good and fresh.the service was pleasant. prices are usual. good experience at albertos
we arrived early and spend some time in the winebar for a couple of drinks. nice place to sit and relax. got some reading done. later we moved to the restaurant. it was quite busy but the service was nice and we had a little time for a chat. the food looked great and tastes likewise.
my sister in law invited me for brunch and we went here she was telling me that the food is great and she was right! i ordered warme panini called pollo and it was very good. would love to comeback!
since the holiday came to an end we went for diner to albertos in nijkerk. we arrived just after 21.00h and that was no problem at all. for nijkerk this time for dining is pretty late but we felt very welcome and the evening had not at all come to an en 
"good restaurant, wide choice, from pizzas to ossobucco. very friendly service, bit of a limited wine list (3 each of white/rose/red). maybe the win bar inside has more to offer? my secreto iberico was really good, pork with clobbered potatoes (translated from dutch)."
"not your standard italian restaurant. nice variety in dishes, they even have pizzas. friendly service, sometimes a bit hectic. the combination with the wine bar works well."
"best italian in the area - superb of food, cool ambience & friendly staffs. what more one would need for an afternoon out!!"
this is a refreshing addition to the restaurant options in nijkerk. it has a laid back atmosphere and the food is good. would definitely recommend.
nice cosy place for easy snack food. not the nicest atmosphere due to high amount of people coming in and out for takeout in the adjoining snackbar.
"bellini‚Äôs pizza and pasta is a decent formula italian located at strand horst, exit 11 of the a28 on the northbound route. great opportunity for a fairly quick meal with better quality than at the neighbouring golden arches. on tuesday they have pizza night, and on wednesday pasta night - all menu items for 10 euros. big helpings. not bad! "
"we came with the kids, got a place on the balcony next to the water (amazing vie "
"the best pizza we had outside italy. service is great also. aparently the place has a very good reputation as most of the tabes were occupied. a starter and a pizza was a little bit too much as the pizzas are very big sied. a real recommendation , perhaps next time we will try some pasta."
the bistecca della casa for many years my number one drive 25 km extra for hospitality wonderful for many years
we had great first dishes also fresh oyster.  we had an excellent red italian wine.  the team was super friendly patient and warm. really recommended
"the atmosphere in the restaurant is nove. the service is fine and very quick. we had pizzas and they were delicious. and, not unimportment, the prices are fine."
"a most pleasant, informal restaurant where the owner participates in the kitchen and checks the meals before they are served. as a result, the quality is excellent and consistent. we can especially recommend that visitors try the fish dishes, which are expertly cooked. we have been regular guests for some years now and certainly will remain so!"
"the food is to die for! great taste and large portions. staff is friendly-ish. some go out of their way, others are a bit cool (no smiles "
"this restaurant never disappoints me. every time the food is great. it does not matter if you order pasta, pizza, fish or meat: everything is fresh and has a great flavo "
"the restaurant has been in ermelo for years and it keeps being the best italian restaurant in the area. they do take aways, but please take the time to go inside, order some authentic italian food, enjoy the fixing in the open kitchen and enjoy your diner. the service is good. young people, but they know what they talk about at your table, instead of telling a line and being nervous when asked a question. pizzas are good, and so are the other dishes on the menu. especially the tagliata a manzo. authentic italian and with your eyes closed, you dream away...enjoying."
"real good food. one advice, reserve in advance, because its almost full everyday, except for monday ( closing day ). you can see the chefs being busy in the kitchen,  "
restaurant with a spacious sunny terras in a tiny village. if you are craving for a good burger i couldnt recommend this place highly enoug 
gorgeous location along a waterway overlooking a small bridg 
we have been checking for restaurants in the area of emmeloord or urk and found da enzo in emmeloord. very nice service and great food. amazing foccacia and pasta. we will come back next time!
we were to feel really welcome when we arrived at the restaurant. we noticed that the restaurant was busy and had a pleasant atmosphere. everyone in our group of six ordered different things and everything was beautifully cooked and well presented. thank you for our lovely evening. 
"had a great tapas meals with my dad and auntie. we were a bit squished in, but it was very busy so forgivable. the staff were brilliant and very helpful with everything. i would definitely go back!"
"we loved the family character of this restaurant and the food that was on the menu. the risotto was yummy, but of course you can also get lots of different pizzas here!"
very nice and cosy place. good size portions. tasty food. polite service. will definitely come back again.
this italian restaurant is in this area the best place to be. nice food and good quality. very friendly people.
went here for a large group dinner and experienced a very nice evening with good italian food served in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. would happily go again either for business or for social dinner as it had a nice authentic feel and everyone enjoyed their meals.
"my wife and i have visited da enzo several times 5 years ago and this year while on holidays in the netherlands and we love the food, really enjoyed it. the staff might sometimes be a bit inexperienced but they are friendly and should maybe get a bit more education on wine , red wine is not in the fridge, but this happens a lot in australia too , some waiters with a hospitality diploma do not know the difference between red and white wine, something about lack in education from ( private?) courses?anyway a lot of hospitality workers are doing their best and are friendly and helpful, the ones that are not interested in hospitality should reconsider their profession. "
"with local friends to the very popular italian here. midweek and busy and good ambience in well appointed restaurant which previously was a simple pizzaria. extensive typical italian menu and huge list of pizza. my seasonal special of a pork rib with mushrooms was delightful with a side veg plate and salad. others had tortellini (rather gigantic), risotto with beef was ok and a saltimbocca ok but the veal was a little tough. small italian wine list of reasonable quality. an enjoyable evening at good price and a friendly italian host."
"always a pleasure to eat here especially when the owner starts his solo mio. a friendly, unhurried atmosphere with attention to service and food. reservation recommended"
"good combination in food, value, quality & atmosphere. during the weekend make sure to make a reservation in time."
randomly came across this place after a series of coincidences. i am so glad we d 
"my friend invited me to go here for dinner. both of us order pasta, which are really good. we come here year ago, we feel it is maybe the best italian  restaurant here."
"very nice authentic italian restaurant. cosy feeling, good atmosphere. food was prepared fast and everything was on point. we had pizzas and the dough is prepared with biologic flour from italy, raised over 24h and you can feel it! ingredients are from italy and all comes together perfectly. i can really recommend this place for a good italian pizza (nothing like the fastfood chains nowadays). i have noticed that the pizza was rich in flavor, but not oily, like it often is in other places. no heavy feeling afterwards :)"
"fine restaurant, good quality food, all fresh and handmade. the pizza and the pasta were really good, what you would expect for these kind of price "
"super friendly staff, quick preparation, and yummy toppings.  they do delivery, takeaway, and (as we did) shared tables or window seats.  reasonable prices as well."
"we visited this restaurant twice within a stay of 3 days for dinner. the pizza is really nice and it almost feels like you‚Äôre in italy. the portions are big ! also, the place offers ice cream, which is really nice for a refreshments."
"certainly on a sunday night, this place was doing most of its business by telephone/delivery, but has a several eat-in tables right by the window overlooking the canal. the food was simple but plentiful and very tasty - and very reasonably priced. its nothing fancy but definitely a very pleasant place to eat in a nice location."
"great pizza take away, especially like bari, pesto en vulcano. rather quick delivery and still warm,"
best pizza in abcoude. not many places to eat in so its best to take out. its always busy there so better call in advance. they also deliver in the neighborhood.
"this is one i specifically asked tripadvisor to add, as it was an impressive enough meal to make note of. youll find porta e porta less than one block from the church in the main town square, and its pizza, salads, and even its desserts are worth tasting. excellent choice for inexpensive, good italian (at least dutch-style italian)."
"on the main street of hillegom , good authentic italian food, with excellent service. over the years i have dined here on a number of occasions it‚Äôs nothing special yet at the same time it‚Äôs a perfect place to eat when on holiday or working in the area . serves good food with excellent service nothing more."
dined here recently on a trip to visit friends in hillegom.  the staff were very friendly and the food was very good.  prices were reasonable too.  will definitely visit again on my next trip to hillegom.
"although located in a small dutch city this is a very good italian cuisine restaurant. the menu is quite rich, with dishes suited for all tastes. the wine is also good and not so pricy. and to complete everything the service is very customer oriented."
"roma antica is located at the far end of the main street in hook of holland. it is a typical neighbourhood italian restaurant which seems to have a loyal customer base and friendly atmosphere. the menu is a standard italian with pastas, meat dishes and pizzas. there were 3 of us and we had spaghetti bolognese, veal in a lemon sauce and a pizza margharita. all were very good. if you are looking for a place to eat before the ferry this fits the bill."
"great food and service, if you are in hoek van holland then this is a recommended restaurant. please note open from 17:00 - 22:00 but not monday."
"hotel and conference centre blooming has a perfect restaurant indicated as zndhv meaning zandhoeve (i.e sand homestead) . my wife told me that it is new, with a new chef. we had dinner here and it was perfect. flexible, friendly and helpful staff, good choice of drinks and a perfect, well created menu, also for vegetarians. we enjoyed zndhv, indeed. fair prices too."
if you are in bergen you need to check out this restaurant for it‚Äôs lovely italian food. you might even bump into a famous az football player. the staff are ready to help with you your order and also really engage with their guest. as for the food it was delicious and i can‚Äôt wait to visit again soon.
authentic italian food. a lot more than just pizza.. which is excellent by the way. nice staff. all good.
"you are right in the center of bergen. its fun to watch passers by. enormous windows let the sun shine through, the service is correct, the food has a touch of italian, pizza and pasta in the foreground. all in all, not very different than the other three or four places in the same location: nero, wonders, loetje. ..one comes here more for the pleasure of watching and beeing watched than for the gastronomic experience."
"i had amazing pizza, very simple and delicious, with adding a little bit of green to it, absolutely amazing and the staff very friendly and and seating area is beautiful and the restaurant located in the middle of the little town."
the pizza was very good and the service aswell. 15 norwegians was all happy. nice prices also! one problem to pay seperatly !
we descended on this place on a friday evening and found a table towards the back of the restaurant. managing a high chair for the 2 year old and a place for our dog and the large pram was done with minimum effor 
"pleasant place with a really good pizza, you can sit in the glassed-over part, but it gets very noisy when it rains - rather amusing if you dont mind."
"have had pizzas at this terrace restaurant at both lunch and dinner time, they offer take-away if you dont fancy eating in, i would recommend you did though. great prompt staff. friendly family atmosphere. nice wine and great tasting pizza. on this occasion i had the capriciossa pizza and shared a half carraf of house red. the two blended perfectly and the price was spot on. i was more than happy to leave a 10% tip. given how busy they were and how well they managed to get the food and drinks out and keep everyone happy. its located on the strip of restaurants and cafes in bergen. a quaint village feel and although i was quite casually dressed the vibe made me feel comfortable and welcomed. the space inside the restaurant is large and has a nice italian feel with column fixtures and a big traditional pizza oven. very impressed indeed "
"la terrazza is a very nice place, with great ambiance. service was excelent, and food superberb.  absolutely worth going for a nice meal.  only minus was that all doors on the terazza was open, and that smokers was allowed at tables outside smoking."
"i really love this place! the staff is really really friendly. the food was very good and we didnt have to wait long. the choices on the menu are very different, good! we highly recommended this place if you are around."
this is an italian restaurant in the same way that clogs and windmills are an experience of holland. it has all the pastas and pizzas you would expect and of a good quality but also nothing beyond that. the price is on the high side but the friendly staff and large portions make up for a lot.
"this is a classic italian restaurant with quite a number of choices on the menu. the service is very attentive, though a bit slow. it may have been the lunch peak when the kitchen was the bottleneck. they give a good value and i would definitely visit again when in bergen. "
"great for family fun or to have a romantic dinner. we went for lunch and had a table for 11, which wasnt a problem. the food was great!! cute little town too :)."
"actually, as a regular visitor i have been recommending this place to people i socialize with for as long as i live here. you see, it really feels like a privilege to live within walking distance of a good italian restaurant. at montagne, even your pizza quattro frommaggi or your pasta bolognese is beyond reproach. if you are a visitor from italy, youll probably be able to determine the region the cook is coming from by the way he prepares a side dish of zucchini that you wont find on the menu but that would make his mother cry out with delight."
"cozy place and friendly staff. good quality and you will need a good appetite! nice menu, good price. but where is the soup? staff told us they really dont sell soup..."
"ok, if you are looking for excellent food in a really nice setting, look no further than la cucina. we were lucky to find this place and had a wonderful meal, fantastic service and all set in a lovely garden."
very nice and well setup restaurant with one part of it being in the yard . i only had dinner 3 times but inside. i found their food to be of high quality after trying the pizza and pasta from menu.
we have visited hoogerheide five times for cyclocross and have walked past the restaurant many times. this time we decided we should eat here. the restaurant was busy and the earliest we could eat was about two hours later so table booked we went into town for drink 
"good food at the local italian restaurant in hoogerheide. the grilled octopus as a starter was great, the carpacio to. the pasta vongole is good but a little to sharp and pizza with grilled vegetables was very tasty. good place!"
"its a good italian restaurant, the food was delicious. the real italian taste. the carpaccio was  amazing, just simple with no other competitive flavors like rucola and cheese . the carpaccio was like it should be, all about the meat! üòÉüëçüèº"
"la cucina italian restaurant in hoogerheide netherlands close to the belgium border was a great surprise. the service was very friendly, the open kitchen concept behind a glass wall was unique and the food was of course delicious. everyone in our party ordered different selections of meals from seafood pasta, lasagna, ossobuco to steak dinner for two persons which i shared called costata di manzo alla brac "
"sofar we have dined several times in la cucina, surely a place to come back to! good hospitality, great food!"
"we visted the restaurant on a weekday in january, whereby the open fire gave a comfortable atmophe "
"we have visited la cucina repeatedly over a 10+ years period. their menu has (always had) great variety. this is also an italian where you can buy superb pizza of course, but their true quality gets revealed when selecting fish, meat, pasta, or their specials outside the menu. nice atmosphere, quiet outside dining is possible on a small court during summ "
"i never write reviews but feel that the proprietors really deserve praise. a well oiled machine with a simple menu. i appreciate what other review said about the cuisine being basic, and as a family of vegetarians we were preparing for the worst. but every lovely staff member went out of their way to translate for us and accommodate our needs. pizzas were think based and delicious (dont expect exotic, you wouldnt get it in italy either), pasta well presented and deserts were authentically italian - id go so far to say as the best tiramisu i have had in years! most importantly the atmosphere was lovely and our little one was treated to a special present when we left. cant recommend the simple but warming restaurant enough. takeaway also available."
"pizza is very tasty, but a little bit expensive (~15‚Ç¨). over this there is no real vegetarian pizza, you can pick between margarita, mushrooms or pesto/mozzarella.  the staff is young and very friendly, the ambiente is wonderful."
because i have an issue with dairy fat and they did not blink an eyelid and told me that would do a meal for me.  very good service and very busy so it good
"we walked in to divino on an uncomfortable night; but they had awesome food, good drinks and the best service. we still talk about it after visiting 4 other michelin restaurants.  just make yourselves at home and let it happen."
always love it to come here. food is amazing and the staff and hospitality is always on point . is amplified you can take everyone .
we had lunch and it exceeded our expectations both in food and service ! people care ‚Ä¶ place is very clean we will be back !
with eastern we had an excellent lunch with the whole family peters. on a sunny day there was reserved al great long table on the terras. we orderd ala cart en each choise was very tasty and excellent. the wines we chose were also very good
"we found this a very interesting and intriguing concept. italian cooking with a fusion twist. different than what you would expect from italian cuisine, this restaurant combines with surprising results and flavors. dishes look like pieces of art. very different from pizza or pasta. autumn ingredients, were combined, with italian traditio "
"the first impression from outside was inside totally confirmed: very friendly service, fine meals (good choice) and the appropriate wines per glas, so that you could try several tastes of wine. we had a very nice dinner evening and we enjoyed from the beginning with apero snacks to the end (good espresso with cantucci and vin santo) and the main courses were delicious and beautiful served. prima!!"
"we have been here for three times already and will return many times. superb meals and fitting wines, great staff who take time to inform you - and they are informed well ! - about the food and the wines. great open kitchen on which you can look at the staff preparing everything in a quick and relaxed mode."
"tried out this restaurant/ bistro and was pleasantly surprised about the menu, wine list and especially the service. staff know their food as well as their wines and are very service oriented. tried the de luxe tapa meat platter which was fantastic. the dinner party enjoyed the scallops with bisque foam sauce, and the latter one showed up on the ravioli as well. the bavete looked small in size but this was compensated by its tenderness and taste. highly commended. "
"in case youre in the neighborhood of eindhoven, this restaurant is for sure worth a detour. the restaurant has a very nice interior with an open kitchen; also nice outdoor seating and even a small playground for children. the menu has simply too many great options to choose from and the service was outstanding. our waitress had an good knowledge about the wine list and you dont see that too often."
"we went away for a quiet weekend, and the guesthouse recommended this restaurant. as it was a sleepy village we did not expect much but we were pleasantly surprised. firstly service is not always good in the netherlands, however this place was as good as anywhere in paris or uk. very attentive staff, friendly, quick and well presented. secondly the terrace is great on a sunny day, we sat outside if a very comfy snug... was just perfect. thirdly the food was a great selection of seasonal food and very tasty and relitiviely cheap for what you got (in fact we came back for lunch the next day!). one small criticism was that the vegetarian selection for my girlfriend was a little limited. and finally the drink selection of wines was amazing, and the coffee was the best i have drunk in the netherlands... was almost as good as in italy"
"visited for a saturday evening meal with our oldest son. excellent service, atmosphere and meal. we had the surprise menu divino and we were done for +/- ‚Ç¨54.00 pp including drinks. unobtrusive, efficient and friendly service.  a real discovery. well be back."
"we went for lunch and wanted to the wine selection. bottles start at 20‚Ç¨ and the sky is the limit. we were very happy with the kerner. main dishes are around 15‚Ç¨, and everbody from our group of 8 was en joy ing it. friendly employes also contributed to a great stay at this pl "
"every option was absolutely fresh and tasty, especially prawns and salmon were the best. staffs were great, very nice location/ decoration. in short was a great experience."
good choice and quality comfortable with good service and friendly at loopuitpark julianadorp easy to park
‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è in my book all day long!    thanx for a beautiful evening üòä all the food was great and even got a little present at desert üëç
the team (chef and service) is very friendly and always try to get you a table when you have no reservati 
the restaurant was able to accommodate a table for 10 without booking. the menu is incredibly extensive making it hard to choose. the pizzas were huge with very generous toppings which does make the base a little soggy in the middle. the wine wasn‚Äôt the best. we thought we had ordered red but it looked more rose! 
i enjoyed this place! really nice pizza and stuff!! you feel that you really eat an italian pizza!! recomend it for sure!!!!
"we were a group of nine people and everybody was happy with the food. we got a nice table outside and the service was friendly. please note however that there is no english menu, as most foreign tourists tend to be german. there was a fussball table outside which entertained the kids while we waited for the food. all in all a good experience. we went twice while we stayed in the area. make sure to book a table in advance - it is expected, although they forgave us for not knowing the first time. :)"
"usually go for the pizza, however the other dishes are nice as well. sometimes it is quite busy and noisy, in summer you can sit outside. parking is free and available."
"service was friendly, pizza was good and all this for a price that was unmatched by nearby restaurants."
we ate at one restaurant on site at center parc port z√©lande ‚Äì nonna‚Äôs on our last night. the food was quite good ‚Äì the majority of us had pizza and they were very accommodating for the five vegans among our group of nine! the waitstaff even broke out into a dance and all the kids in our group joined i 
we have spent sometime in andijk but had never tried this establishment what a great mistake that w 
the location and the view are really beautiful. the waitress was so helpful. we enjoyed the food so much.
we stopped for coffee and were given fabulous friendly welcome and service - beyond anything you should expect.  the coffee came quickly and was very good.  lovely location on the dyke with beautiful views.  excellent.  cannot recommend highly-enough
"we came here in may for dinner. lovely ambience, super service! they are sticking to a small menu, therefore products are fresh and divine. a place where locals meet."
lovely hotel bar and restaurant in a beautiful setting by the creek or what ever they call it in holland. english speaking of course. english and dutch menus. huge rooms. great breakfast included and really great dinners. plenty of parking off road. highly recommended and run and owned by a local family. 
"service is very friendly, food is great, timing is perfect. a family ran restaurant which is really focused on their customers and with a good menu selection. i will for sure return!"
"our last night in uden and this restaurant was recommended to us. we both had pasta dishes. my husband the spaghetti bolognese and i had pasta filled with spinach and ricotta. mine needed a little more salt and more ricotta because the spinach really over powered the dish but my husband said that his was the best he ever had. we then had tiramisu and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce which both were very good! the atmosphere is very nice and romantic, but good for families as well! i love the fact that they had a diaper changing table in the bathroom because a lot of the restaurants near our hotel do not. would definitely recommend for good italian food!"
"this restaurant in uden is one of my favorite restaurants in uden. the taste of the food is excellent and a lot of choice. furthermore the staff is always friendly and i always feel welcome. the interior is modern, not very traditional. the restaurant is quite big but most of the time it is advisable to order a table. the prices are not budget, but the quality is good. there are choices for vegetarian, but more is always welcome. the only thing i miss in the interior is the traditional italian feeling.. it is quite modern."
"we had a 3 course menu. turned out to be an excellent choice! as starter we had 5 different amuses. main course was a pasta or a pizza. dessert was a plate with 5 different sweet snacks. all for the very democratic price of 19,95‚Ç¨!"
"pretty good. ive been here a few times now, and its a solid italian restaurant. very freindly service."
we had really good pizza and pasta here on tuesday night along with some beers. friendly small restaurant although we were the only people there on this night. very helpful waiter and chef. food was all freshly cooked and ingredients were fresh. prices are good too. definitely recommend for hungry cyclists like us.
"went there for dinner about 3 times, the service is quite friendly, the restaurante is clean and pleasing ambience. food quality is goog, the pizza recipes are not the best, but still good ingredients and tasty food.  good for every dinner."
very fun italian food.  great pizza and the prices were reasonable.  i would definitely recommend it.  located near the large church.
"this was a random find as we were trying to find anything open on a tuesday night (the greek spot is open, though i dont recommend it... "
this restaurant offers nice food & service with an italian bite. pricing is average /higher than a take-away pizza restaurant. you can have some problems parking your car. reservations not necessary.
"im living in italy for more than 10 years and usually dont eat pasta when i go out of country, but in this restaurant, call my attention the colours and the good taste with which it has been decorated, surprise me the love and dedication that the owners have for work on it, smiling and attentive to more minimum detail, so enthusiastic for the good energy in this place i decided eat penne di nonna and surprise was delicious!!!"
the place offers a great variety of ice cream flavours..some of them really unusual but tasty. we took also a cappuccino and it was very good.
the coffee is good and they have a great selection of ice-cream for very reasonable price  the coffee also came with a small mini ice-cream and syrup which was nice and cute.
nice selection of ice creams - refreshing after walking around the interesting locality of baarle-nassau and baarle-hertog with its many border crossings between the netherlands and belgium.
very delicious ice cream served by very friendly staff. no more no less just good! i took the vanilla and mocca with a touch of cream. i also taste the coconut and citrus.   mix some flavors and you won‚Äôt be disappointed!
"la pergola is the only authentic italian restaurant in baarle-nassau. located on the chaamseweg, this is where to go if you want a tasty italian pizza. dont be mistaken by the cheap takeaway across the street. la pergola sits hidden in the back of a driveway, right behind a french restauran "
"they serve pizza, and they serve it good! about 8 pizzas on the menu, all delicious with a little twist."
"on a business trip my hosts suggested an  italian  restaurant. from the outside looks inviting. on entering into the main restaurant one can immediately see it really,  fine dining , italian style. re inforced, when asking for a gin and tonic, to be presented with a small bound card with no less than 8, g+t options ( italian gin). the food was also as exciting, with the nice feature of a small gift starter from the kitchen. the staff were also very friendly and professional. a place to go again."
after stroking a few sheeps in dutch highlands we decided to arrange a dinner at adriano and it was a blas 
"this was a real treat. the food was delicious (we had the 4 course surprise menu), the service was lovely and the decor was great, too. such an enjoyable night!"
nice location and authentic italian (no pizza!). good food and good service. place cares for a refurbishing though and price vs quality i found it overpriced (not michelin star but prices are). pretends to be very posh but sometimes too informal. very good and robust choice but it could be better...
"always love to come to restaurants where real italians cook! this one is according to my favorite tastes: sapori italiani. they also prepare for you what is not on the menu, like anti-pasti. they make what they have available, delightful. atmosphere is cosy and intimate (didnt overhear our neighbors talking e.g.), service is personal and swift. food was delicious to me, and i am not complaining about the prices. it was a treat, all the way! love to come again. please adriano, stay on!"
"as a guest, we were unsure of our destination other than itali "
by fabrizio was the nearest restaurant to our hotel on sunday evening and we booked a tab 
we discovered this wonderful restaurant on our drive from weert to our hotel in hee 
"it has been a long time ago that we have eaten such great italian dishes. great food,friendly service and nice location. warm and inviting! compliments!!"
"hidden behind a bit inconspicuous facade lies a very good restaurant where chef massimo and tonie serve the greatest pastas, pizzas, meat or fish dishes and exquisite desser "
if i could use one word for this review it would be excellent! you wouldnt expect such top quality food when passing this facade .. it was not cheap..but that was our choice.
"lovely friendley small italian resteraunt, we had the chicken pizza unbelievable so much fresh vegetables and so much chicken breast,love the atmosphere there we will be back"
"i have twice recently had the pleasure of eating at la fortuna restaurant in heeze, the food was excellent of both occasions, the helpings good, the service pleasant and genuine and the value overall was very good. it was very clear this restaurant uses only the best and freshest ingredients (local if possible) and has a passion for delivering his customers the best they can, a rare quality in many restaurants today. the second night i was there, it was much less crowded than my first visit and that gave me time to appreciate how good it really was. if you are anywhere near heeze or eindhoven, i could highly recommend la fortuna, especially if you like good food."
"the village of heeze,in the province of brabant (the netehrlands) is surrounded by an extended heath landscape in which it is nice to walk. but do not get lost! it has a nice castle and a lots of restaurants amongst which one with three michelin stars. we just discovered, however, a cosy, small italian restaurant just 10 metres out of the centre called la fortuna. a great choice of home made dishes, pizzas pastas and what have you, good ingredients,decent prices."
this is a locally owned little resto. in the middle of downtown limbricht.  friendly service with good food for the buck (or ‚Ç¨). wines good as well. parking around the corner.  we recommend this trattoria!
the ices were very tasty and super service provided by eleonore. the ice coffees are also very good prepared.
today we ordered pizza online and i must say that these were the best pizzas ever! here is why we say th 
"schiedam, a small city on the rotterdam fringe, overlooked by many tourists who barrel down the freeway. this city is well worth a stop and a look around, from the stedelijk , jenever,( dutch gin), and servers other museums and then the tallest windmills in the country. explore the windmill museum,take a boat tour around the city which is a real highlight. or just enjoy a drink on the stadhuis plein. a very relaxed , friendly city to explore and enjoy. something for the whole family. dont pass this city. close to the the hague , rotterdam and easily reached by public transport. explore this city, whilst some parts are still under regeneration, this is normal for any city,. a very relaxed enjoyable day. well worth the visit."
it is in principle a top wine bar and more recently they started to serve smaller meals in between tapas and a fully fledged restaurants. very cozy atmosphere. fantastic alternative if you don‚Äôt want a full meal.
"this relatively new ice cream parlor in schiedam has taken off with a good start, the ice cream is creamy and very flavorf "
i was very impressed by the italian tastes of the dishes and i think everything was delicious!the service was excellent and i surely will came back again with family and friends!!!
we had diner at al bella rose. a nice little italian trattoria. simple but excellent food. my companions had delicious pasta and i was treated with a very sovoury pizza mare nostro. very nice and friendly staff. worth visiting!!!
"had a really nice dinner here. friendly staff. very good food. my only point of feedback is that when i wanted to order the nduja pizza, staff warned me that the nduja would not be sliced sausage but a paste of this sausage. i can imagine people being disappointed with this, so i do appreciate the caution (which probably has a reason). but having the nduja sliced rather than as a paste would be my preference."
outstanding service!! we ordered a big order on-line on saturday 6/24 at noon and the order was ready for pick up by 5 
"i had the calamari as starter and it was very tasty esp. the aioli. i can also recommend the carpaccio. the highlight of my evening was the tagliatelli with mushrooms and truffels, so delicious. the portions were generous so be warned. the ambiance is very welcoming and cozy. the staff was very friendly and accomodating. be sure to visit if you crave italian food"
"in august 2017, we visited pronto! for a family dinner. choices for pizza are enormous, for fish and meat limited, but good in variety. the food itself tasted very good, well cooked and seasoned with the right herbs. overall a very good meal, also for the kids."
"an perfect place to be! original pizza`s and other food. nice about the place is the space to sit: the room is high and there is a lot of room arround your chair, you cannot hear your neighbour. also nice: there is a lot of parkingplaces outside, not uninportant!"
"the restaurant is nice, the italian chef, massimo, is a master. i had the honour to meet him before dining and i can confirm his proficiency. staff is good and girls are kind. i suggest you this place for a nice pizza or an italian dinner. "
"excellent value for money! good, fresh food for reasonable prices. friendly staff although i do recognize an earlier comment about staff asking for a reservation and then taking a long time to decide where to seat you in a clearly half-empty restaurant."
"pronto offers very good quality pizza and other food for a very reasonable price. they have regular special offers during weekdays which are even sharper priced. the atmosphere inside is very nice with a great view in the kitchen on the traditional pizza oven. i would definitely recommend to go and have dinner there with the family, or just with your partner."
we were here for the fourth time and we had a wonderfull meal again. personal is very friendly and fast and the interior of the resturant is modern and good. were going bach sometime
"excellent italian restaurant, pizza with genuine ingredients. the owners are italian and cook very well, they are very kind. the dishes are real italian, with no dutch or touristic influences!"
very good and very professional! a very good place where have a nice meal with fresh recepies in the heart of schiedam
we had a warm welcome and we had a good dinner last friday. everyone in the company enjoyed their meal. i certainly want to go back when i go back to schiedam.
we ate here a few times whilst in schiedam for a business trip. it was exactly what we were looking for - good food for a reasonable price. the service was friendly and there was a nice atmosphere outside with views on to the square.
"every guest is welcomed by the owner, a nice and friendly person, i a way that you feel at home immediatly. the dishes are all very tastefull."
"we sat down at the terrace with the sun setting, looking for a nice dinne "
"dropped in for a spot of lunch and found an amazing italian. some of the best italian food ever had, despite living in milan for 10 years. very reasonable prices, fantastic service and a real passion form the owners to serve you great food with an open armed italian welcome. will be a regular now! thanks for a lovely welcome and fantastic food. "
"ive now dined here numerous times. a very simple restaurant, more cafe like at times but located overlooking one of the nicest parts of schiedam. the menu is simple but provides a good range of pasta and pizza. the recent addition of alcohol has certainly added to the appeal with italian beers and wines now available. dining is best outside people watching the beautiful square. upstairs is not so pleasant but downstairs allows you to see the wonderful owner organise her staff. the service can be a little slow at times but is always friendly. and the food is fabulous. fantastic pizzas and pasta. proper home style cooking full of flavour and at very reasonable prices. my favourite place to eat in schiedam for a relaxed, flavourful and friendly meal. grazie mille. "
"after i left italy it was hard to find a real good italian restaurant in the netherlands. cotto e mangiato is a rare place where you can get a real italian food, great quality and fine prices."
"very recommendable italian restaurant, we had a dinner and we ordered different types of pizzas. the ingredients were very tasty and the dough well cooked! to drink, they have a variety of natural juices which are very recommendable too."
cotto en mangiato is a combination of deli and (lunch)restaurant. i have lunch here regular 
i am not a great ice cream expert but good selection of flavours ranging from silly (smurf!) to exotic fruits and usual favourites like chocolate. friendly staff made allowances for my terrible dutch
nice location opposite old town hall and next to small lift bridge and manual lock on canal.  good selection of flavours and (gluten free) sorbet.
the pizza is amazing‚Ä¶ the best pizza in netherlands. a very friendly and cozy family owned restaurant..the girl was also very good.
"we a visiting fresco already for years. the ice cream is great, especially the apple flavor in combination with the nuts on top off."
"de olifant is an italien restaurant. not the standard ones with pizza, but original italien food. we are sure we will go back one time."
"very nice restaurant. friendly staff and tasty food. as usual, i could not decide between the main courses, and the staff were flexible enough to serve a combination of two (codfish, risotto with some cheesy sauce and, i must admit, the best spinach). although im never a great fan of pronounced desserts after a savory main dish, this modest dessert certainly met my expectation."
"the first night we ate here the food was great and the service was excellent. we had a lovely meal and liked everything we were served. so, we returned the next night and we were very disappointed. we were seated in a room with a table of 8 people who had too much to drink and were very loud - when we got there! we indicated we would like to sit in another room and we were denied the change. the first half of our evening we could not even hear each other - until the party of 8 left. we were the only other group sitting in the room, so that left us alone but it was quiet. unfortunately, we were then ignored most of the evening. luckily we were leaving for another part of the netherlands the next day. not sure we would return here as it seems to be hit and miss."
on this historicall place is situated the olifant. beautiful view on the river vecht. you can eat inside or outside. we had a three course diner on the terrace in the early evening. the place was quite full. personel is friendly and professional. food is italian but no pizzas here. there is a small card with enough of choice also vegetarian. wine card leaves enough variety.all courses tasted very well and made up nicely. prices are a bit high we found but the food is good so why worry.
"comfortable, modern relaxed restaurant serving high quality food. saturday night visit so it was busy, staff very helpful and friendly."
"great service, basic food served well (the freshness and the choice of ingredients do the sell) 50th wedding anniversary also happened to be booked when i arrived which also created a lovely atmosphere. shame it was the evening as i couldnt appreciate the surroundings."
"the food was wonderful and the staff were lovely, we were given english menus and were seated quickly. there was a large selection of food on the menu and our server answered any queries we had happily. the food came quickly and was delicious, we all enjoyed our meal very muc "
"recommend for nice pizza. quick service, cook knows what hes doing. decent price. liked the choice of sweets"
this italian is located in the tiny brugstraat (bridge street) with two way traffic but one and a half street width. that street itself gives entertainment when cars come from both sides (with care and attention cars can pass). the restaurant has a welcoming atmosphere and lots of menu choices. you wont leave this place hungry and you wont leave this place broke either. they serve meat and fish dishes as well as vegetarian meals. there is also pizza and pasta. it is an italian restaurant! we would definately revisit.
"very nice restaurant with a big pizza oven that makes very tasty pizza‚Äôs. great place, i am sure i will visit it again, when i am in the neighbourhood üëåüèº"
"great service. the waiter was very nice to us and made good reccomendations. food was very tasty. we were five people and we finished it all (2 starters, 3 pizzas, 1 steak and 2 pastas)."

"we have going to this restaurant for 5 years now and we are still very happy about the quality of the food. the ambiance is romantic and is perfect for a nice date. the service is friendly and welcoming. pasta, pizza and meat all dishes great taste and specially the dessert tiramisu."
nice italian family serving good price-quality italian food. lots of pizza and pasta choices. dine in restaurant or pizza delivery are both good. no outside terrace and delivery is sometimes slow... will come back often.

very nice italian restaurant with terrace outside. the pizza and pasta dishes are very good. friendly staff.
nice business diner  good food and service  bruschetta was very good   good selection of beers  palm beer was good   lasagne was ok   colleague enjoyed the steak
it‚Äôs the second time i come here. once in the evening for a risotto which was cheap and excellent in a great atmosphere since there was a high quality singer that evening. today for lunch for an excellent and well-priced pizza burrata. i ordered an orange juice: generous glass of fresh juice at a very reasonable price. the place is big but very nicely decorated. not to be expected in this area. 
nice pizzeria in a shopping centrum. for lunch you can make a reservat for bigger groups.  the is good and the service friendly.
we decided to visit this restaurant on a hot thursday evening in ju 
this restaurant offers excellent pizza.  also the pasta dishes are good prepared.  the service is fast and friendly.
i have visted this restaurant the first time in february and since this a returned several tim 
"nice italian restaurant. sometimes a little bit sloppy service. because they also serve gluten free food, our doughter has coeliakie, we have eaten here a few times, she never had problems afterwards, big ok for this restaurant!"
"it was lovely dinner with family here. good food, it comes in big portion. we ordered pizza and pasta. my fav is pizza margharitha."
atmosphere in the front is very nice. in the back a little bit less with too much light. food was good. bit very special but price quality it was good.
"after a busy day at the local knitting festival we visited this restaurant on the strength of the reviews and were not disappointed. the service was prompt, the atmosphere great and the pizzas were quite simply as good as we have ever experienced. we understand the chef is italian - and he clearly excels. the base is nice and thin and the toppings generous. the soup and desserts were also very tasty. its the sort of place we wish we had back home - thats how much we enjoyed  "
this was the perfect stop for dinner before going to the hook of holland to catch our overnight ferry. it‚Äôs about 30mins drive to the ferr 
"we love their pizza‚Äôs!  we visit the restaurant once in the two months and we remain excited about the pizza‚Äôs. the taste, the size and the price are all great and totally in balance.  we are happy to live in the neighbourhood."
"i ordered a green salad. this was reasonably priced and a very large salad with beetroot, pine nuts, a wide variety of salad etc. i then had the 5 cheese pizza. this was accompanied by a sparkling mineral water. this came to 15.5 euros. not b "
"a pleasant atmosphere in this place, large portions, and very tasty (pasta/pizza), a good selection of wine, one minus - a small selection of draft beer, but in total a very cozy and modern place. with nice and friendly staff."
a new restaurant we discovered by coincidence. has a very nice and cosy setting and great service. great choice of authentic italian food. our group of 12 (!) choose from a wide range of entries and main dishes and all was served perfectly timed and without having too wait long. well be back!
"we came in for lunch, so the place was very quiet and thus finding a table was easy. the coffee was great and the food was delicious. we didnt have to wait long for our orders to be taken or for the food to arri "
"made in italy is a large and modernly decorated formula italian restaurant on the edge of the bogaard shopping centre in rijswijk. service was quick and pleasant. food came very quickly despite a moderate amount of guests in the house. helpings failry sizeable. taste rather bland and a bit oily, but doable. overall a good experience for a fast meal ahead of the election debate."
it is a very cosy restaurant. we love going the 
"weve been here several times. with my family or with a friend and our kids. theres a great space for the kids to play (small kids tables, toys etc) so mamas can have dinner while kids are playing. we loved the pizza and the tiramisu. my friend also had ravioli with truffles and mushrooms which was excellent. and also important, very good prices and very friendly and quick service. can only recommend. "
"made in italy has only been opened for a few weeks and as it is only a few minutes walk from my house, i decided that i needed to give it a try, the restaurant has a very modern d√©cor, no straw covered chianti bottles hanging from the ceiling in this establishment and is split into a bistro area at the front, the restaurant in the middle and an area at the rear, set with a few large tables for big partie "
great dinner with real italian food.  very nice atmosphere inside. i recommend pasta with gambas and proseco
after at least one year i visited this restaurant again.  the fillet pepper steak with two sorts of was excellent.  also excellent the gratinated aubergine. the variety of starters is as usually.  the desserts are also very good. friendly staff.
"we have been to gran sasso several times and this is place where you want to return again and again. the service is excellent, the food and wines are delicious!"
fantastic experience at gran sasso. authentic food and nice people. wine offer was good and presentation of food well done.
the staff and the food is great! the food is cooked carefully and therefore it is really tasty. the prices are affordable for the dutch standards. i definetly recommend.
"when we walked away after terrible experience in a nearby restaurant , we felt very welcome in gran sasso.also the food was really tasty, and the staff is very helpful."
"if you search genuine italian food or a good pizza, this is the right place. the food is really good and the place in the center of rijswijk is cozy and warm."
"great service and wonderful italian food. we love to eat here. nice in the old centre of rijswijk. you must eat the carpaccio,"
"lovely restaurant, delicious food! the service was a little slow as the owner was training up the other two serving staff. they were able to make a dish of gluten free pasta for my mum. the layout of the restaurant was nicely laid out, though a bit cramped."
"wonderful evening with some dear friends. good service, excellent food, carpaccio fantastic. nice atmosphere, friendly staff. all food freshly prepared by people that know what they are doing. great spot for dinner in rijswijk"
the food was great and the service was excellent! we asked for vegetarian food and they went out of the way to make our lunch one of the best!
"i have been eating at gran sasso several times in the recent past and each time was an enjoyable and rewarding experience. while modestly priced, the authentic italian food is of very good quality."
visited alone on busine 
"we love to eat here. the food is fantastic, the season menus very well put together. the desserts to die for. without doubt the best restaurant in rijswijk."
"the new owner has given the restaurant a nice, modern but stylish interior. the restaurant is fairly small. the owner and staff have personal attention for everyone. owner, staff and chef are all italians which adds to the atmosphere and authenticity of the place. when it comes to the food and wines, they know what they are doing. everything is fresh and well prepared. after many trips to all parts of italy, i can safely say that the food served here is as authentic as can be. good food, good drinks and a friendly atmoshere. you cant go wrong with gran sass "
"great italian, not the simple traditional one, but a real fine one, each day evening menu is a surprise and has never been a disappointment. excellent food and wine. great cook, great service with it, and angelo what an italian charm."
we found this restaurant unexpectedly while walking through the charming old streets of old rijswijk.  we were greeted with a lovely welcome and had great service from all the staff.  the food was just perfect and matched the warm and inviting atmosphere.
"very friendly, verry welcome, verry helpfull! ah yes and the cook verry good!"
"you are warmly greeted when you walk into gran sasso. located in the heart of the older part of the town of rijswijk, just south of den haag, it is easy to get to. the menu offers a great variety. each night there is a special 3 course meal at a discounted cost. we often find the 3 course meal more food than we want but the flavors are so well blended that we still order it. if you speak any italian the owner will be delighted and lavish you with extra attention. see http://www.gransasso.nl/ for more information"
we visit fellinis for several years now and when coming to holland it‚Äôs one of the first things we do. we visit the best italian michelin star restaurants abroad but the pizza and pasta from fellinis are seriously the best in the world! the staff is very nice and nothing is too much to ask.. the ingredients are fresh and a lot is homemade. my 4 year old never wanted to eat pizza but since he tried the one from fellinis he loves pizza! worth a visit!! 
"outstanding food, outstanding and friendly service and wonderful ambiance. the truffle pasta is to die for‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs just one of the great dishes on offer"
"this is real honest perfectly prepared food like you will find in a well known good bistro/restaurant somewhere in italy not contaminated yet by mass tourism. one tip for the chef shop for better quality lam chops with more taste. the preparation and cooking is high quality, but the meat itself is too blend. lower the amount of 4 chops to three to compensate for the higher price of better lamb. "
"excellent! a real italian restaurant with a nice atmosphere and delicious food. its like eating in italy. very nice and friendly staff and excellent food. its a must for me in this area, when i want to eat good italian food. recommended."
the surrounding is decently spoken not breathtaking.  however the food is really very good.  it doesnt matter if you choose meat or pasta or pizza. it is tasty and well prepared.  nice atmosphere and great staff.  its better to make a reservation.
"the food, wine and atmosphere takes you to ita "
"i went twice in 2 weeks to this restaurant; many locals, quite busy but very friendly atmosphere..the first time i took a pizza calzone, a bit too moisty for my taste, but reasonable. second time i took the spaghetti carbonara, good taste portion a bit sma "
been here with my family on holiday and found this location cause of tripadvisor. scepticle because of the surrounding we went in and had a wonderful dinner with perfect dishes. thank you for bringing italy in my mind and stomach. we will come again.
one should not feel worried about the surroundings of the restaurant... a meaningless shopping area in rijswijk. but the heartfelt welcome of the staff of marea and the excellent food make it more than up for the ar 
"the food is great, the atmosphere as well, so recommended! you if love real italian food, thats where you need to go."
"we had dinner there, antipasti very fresh, saltimbocca very tasty, tiramisu really homemade, you can really taste it. one of the best italian in the hague area, to be highly recommended!"
"probably chosen by a blind man during a misty night, the location of this great pizzeria is a mystery: its ensconced in an old commercial mini mall on the back of a brandless supermarket. difficult to find and easy to miss at the same time, the place doesnt look like much on the outside and is quite average inside. if you find it in your heart to forgive them their poor location, you will be rewarded with great italian food like pasta with generous shaves of truffle and cheese or fantastic pizza (try blue cheese with spinata romana).go ahead have a carb fiesta, it will put a smile on your face and wont dig a hole in your wallet!"
"its not only about the food (always fresh and amazingly good). is also about the people. if you love italy, italian food and italian people, you must love restaurant marea. hidden in the gallery, you wouldnt notice it just driving by, but be sure every evening youll find it full! it is that good"
when you enter you could think you are somewhere in the south of italy but the languages spoken are dutch and english. the pizza are very good and the crew is very friendly. reservation mandatory.
"an italian expat told me that the pizza made is marea is the only pizza in the hague and neighbourhood which is made from authentic italian ingridients. well, thats true, the pizza is absolutely decilicious and tastes different from pizzas in other location. and there are a lot of kinds of pizza hard or impossible to find in other pizzeria "
in the meantime i have visited this restaurant another three times.  it is a nice and cosy restaurant with very friendly service.
nice pizzeria with some tables outside.  we have had pizza. it has been good prepared and has been tasty.  the espresso has been also good.  friendly service.
"firstly, this restaurant has moved. the address on both tripadvisor, as well as on the restaurantt own website is wrong. we found this out only after walking for hal an hour with hungry kids. not coo "
i wanted to give 5 stars but then the beautiful blond girl said she will leave soon. 4 stars for this place with also spainish music
i know this hidden place now for several years and i have a pizza there every now and then (at least once a quarter). not the shiniest place but best value for your money and heeeeeel lekker!!!!
"been eating at casanova for years and the pizzas are great. agree with other reviewers that the decor leaves a lot to be desired and leo the owner does things his way. service can be variable, but the head waitress monique is great, so hopefully she will be on, the night you visit. can recommend the calzone, but in general all the pizzas are great."
i have ordered again and it took some time. all in all 45 minutes. they told it in advance.   the large italian pizza mexican has been tasty at usually.   very friendly delivery service.
i have ordered quite often during the last years.   my favourite is the  mexican hot & spicy  italian style. i dont like pan pizza.  the taste is great and the home delivery works very well. for me the choice in rijswijk.
"nyp makes the best pizzas: order one and you will confirm. great flavors, healthy ingredients (no e-numbers), freshly baked, quick delivery. good prices too, and always special deals. all ok!"
by far the best pizza doll i ever had. i am not sure what they put in it but i have to say it does worth every penny :)
"the owner got us a freshly made pizza as the vegetarian options in the ready-to-eat slices were next to none. loved the freshly baked, crispy medium pizza which was garnished with veggies and garlic powder."
attractive restaurant in old rijswijk. the place is beautiful and the food excellent. the variety of food and wine is superb. the only issue is that they do not accept credit cards. in todays digital world this is unacceptable. as an englishman or frenchman this means carrying cash around. in such a beautiful resto this does not make sense. it seems to be the norm in quite a few places in holland. an oddity in such a modern jurisdiction.
"randomly chosen this trattoria, situated in the nicest area of the old rijswijk, only for a drink but when i saw the oven here, we ended up ordering piz "
i have been two or three times.  it is an excellent italian restaurant in rijswijk.   may favourites are the involtini and the pizza crudo.   nice atmosphere and friendly service.
"we decided to spend our 2nd christmas evening at maximo with the family. the christmas menu was a lovely 6-course meal. starting with some anti-pasti, the 2nd course was home-made ravioli with a filling of pumpkin and cheese sauce wich was absolutely delicious! the ravioli was perfectly al dente, combined with the tasty and silky smooth filling. also the fish (zeewolf) and tenderloin with black trufflesauce were very tasty en very well prepared. maximo has the perfect location and atmosphere, the young, yet capable waiters and waitresses friendly and apt and food is delicious! we will certainly keep making the trip to enjoy good italian food at maximo. and i can‚Äôt wait for spring and summer to sit at their cosy terrace!"
"great italian place, very nice calamari, excellent pizzas, real italian feeling in rijswijk! friendly service, good menu with a wide food selection. good open wines as well. we will be back!"
"we visited maximo on a monday evening, reading all the prior reviews i was almost discouraged to do so but since all other restaurants in rijswijk were closed on monday, we gave it a go. we ended up spendig a lovely evening in a very nice setting, it was very warm, the fire place was on, nice music contibuted to a very relaxing athosphere. i would really like to compliment the two waiters, they were young but very attentative and professional. we ate parmiggiana and seafood pasta and house made tiramissu, which was especially delicious. the food was very tasty, nicely presented and portions were quite generous. very pleasent evening and for sure we will come back to try their pizzas."
"to tell you the truth, we went for the lunch but the pasta and pizza were so good that we came back the same day for dinner, the personal is very friendly and the service was excellent."
"amazing food, amazing people, amazing service, amazing atmosphere. love going there in the mornings for a delicious espresso and a business meeting, for a lunch with my family or with business partners, for dinners... already had countless meals at maximo and maximo always delivered... and, have i mentioned the surprises from the house? sometimes it is a cheese cake, sometimes it is a delicios chefs panna cotta... it feels great to be welcomed almost like a member of the maximos family. 100% recommended."
"always a pleasant experience and good, wholesome food. maximo is usually our go-to restaurant for lunch here in our village, located on the outskirts of the hague. their extensive menu and selection of vegetarian items are ideal for my family, whose tastes are varied. the caprese and grilled aubergine and courgette sandwiches are served on oven-fresh ciabatta and served with a bit of salad garnish. the pizzas and pasta are generous as is the dessert offering, which includes one of the best tiramisus ive had. service is usually good, however, they have recently revamped their staff (and menu) and the server i had during lunch yesterday was very cordial and professional. im hoping theyll add a fixed-price lunch menu during the week which would probably be a good draw. they also have some great deals on pizza takeaway at the beginning of the week. definitely worth a try, especially if youre looking for a new regular place to feel at home and be well fed and cared for."
i went there with friends on a summer evening.  the staff were very helpful as we had a small child with us.  the restaurant is lovely inside and has a lovely terrace.  i had pizza and it was fantastic!   prices are very reasonable!
"great pizza, friendly service and stylish atmosphere - a real pearl in the heart of rijswik! perfect location for a family with small kids, free parking just by the door and spacious garden, just as in italy!"
"best italian experience up to now in holland. i decided to celebrate my birthday at maximo, and i got more that i was expected. my friends and i enjoyed a lot the delicious fresh homemade food , everything was great in taste and also thanks to the staff which was enthusiastic and welcoming. highly recommended !"
a nice place for a fine dinner with good wine with your partner or for a pizza with friends. the place is elegant and the dishes are beautifully presented.
"a tiny italian restaurant and take-away off the beaten-track serving excellent freshly made pizza and pasta dishes. small and plain, its not a place for a intimate evening but it is a bit special. my pizza was wonderfully thin and crispy, but my wifes pasta had very little of the meat it was supposed to have (ossenhaas) and the truffle was non-existent. that said, the home-made tiramisu is to die for - save space for it!"
"when we visited gioja we were blown away by the quality of the food. the taste, everything was as my friends told me. perfect. small point of improvement: the pasta with seafood was very heavy on salt. but h√©, this could happen.."
this is by far the best italian restaurant in the neighberhood; everything is freshly made by italian people for a good price. once you have been here you never want to go anywhere else!
one of the few places in the area to get a good selection of great coffees and some good cake too. the only downside is that its located in a rather bland shopping centre that you wont be in for long enough to warrant stopping for an extra half-hour for the coffee.
this restaurant opened in april 2017 and was a succes from the start. the family run restaurant offers very good quality coffee and food.
this review is about the beachline in ‚Äòs gravesande. it is a beach sports outfit but also very much a regular beach club where you can have a drink or eat food. innovative and working very well is their ordering via a table specific qr code which leads to a well working mobile web site. no more waiting for the waiter! delivery was quick and accurate.
it was a very funny trip and the workers are very friendly. the wind was good at this day. first it is hard to learn but when you know it you can drive fast.
nice place to have fun on the beach. lots of different activities from adventures to just fun. professional guidance from supervisors that will stay with you throughout the entire activity and make sure you have a great time. afterwards you can enjoy a nice meal in the beach pavilion.
"simple but cosy beach pub, with good food. tuna salad on ciabatta was very nice; wiekse witte as tap beer in the sun at the wind shielded terrace was great. toilets not so clean, unfortunately."
"cozy italian, a little pricey but pleasant. things we lik "
"wonderful pizzeria with traditional stone oven. tasty and sumptuous pizzas, pastas and more. perfect for a date, family dinner or just take away even. competent pricing, value for money and a cosy ambience."
"this review is especially for italians. if youre looking for a very good pizza with birra moretti, bruschette, sorbetto al limone and much more just come over. you can find also home made linguine and ravioli. its a tiny cosy place, always crowded so reservation is a must. its not for a quiet romantic night out but if youre looking for a good pizza this is the pla "
"great pizza, owner and staff very friendly and helpful  i highly recommend this restaurant  good selection of pizzas and starters and a range of delicious homemade desserts"
"good authentic italian pizzeria with quality ingredients, traditional stone oven method of baking, justifies slightly expensive menu. you can choose to enjoy the ambience in the restaurant with some wine or coffee, if not, you can just take-away your order. either way one would be full and delighted by tasty pizza "
"what a nice surprise! me and my wife are always looking for a good pizza place- well we found an excellent one, with a very quaint nicely decorated interior, good service, tastey pizza, very nice house wine, finishing with a great lemon tiramisu. highly recommended-we will be making this one of our regular stops."
"very nice returent,  the prices are great, and the service is wonderful. comfy and charming place, good for families"
"one of the best pizzas in the utrecht area. very good wood-fired pizza. friendly staff. cozy place to eat, although i normally take out."
"honestly, the oven pizza here is awesome!  i felt as if i were eating back in italy. i never expected to find such authentic, cozy italian place in utrecht area. they focus on quality rather than quantity."
"again we ordered some pizzas here. pasta is not an option yet, its all about pizza and anti past "
pizza and pasta a la mama! very good food served by friendly staff. all the right flavors are there. ingredients were very fresh and tasty and that my friends is the most i lik 
"very small restaurant that also makes pizzas for take away. the pizzas are light and thin with a loverly crispy dough. they are absolutely delicious and you can see that the owners truly care about their food. unfortunately , the pizza are so light that they are also not terribly filling. my kids managed to finish their grown up pizzas without batting an eye, which meant that as an adult with an average to larger apetite you leave feeling like you could probably have eaten at least another half pizza. but at 12 euros for a pizza, you dont."
eating with family for a nice christmass  5 course meal. great service and even better food. authentic italian food and great wines !

i went here with a person who was allergic to gluten and lactose. i informed ahead and told marco what she wanted to eat and he made sure that the diner was allergen free. the food was amazing in taste and we had beef that was so soft you could almost suck it and grilled to perfecti 
"almost every 2 weeks we get pizza for take away. they are the real italian pizzas! once a while we eat in the restaurant, very nice people and the real italian stuff! dont forget to bring something from the wine shop!"
"a good variety of italian appetisers, main courses, sides and desserts. set meals are huge, so make sure you ask about it or at least share with friends. vegetarians and vegans are welcome and the staff speaks good italian and english (as well as dutch, of course) at this cosy restaurant with a rustic atmosphere."
i was so excited to hear that they were opening an italian restaurant right in our little town of vleuten. a real authentic italian restaura 
"finally an italian restaurant, in the area, that makes me feel back to my country: the friendly people, the quality of the food, the quantity of the food, that wood pizza oven. all the ingredients to make me looking forward to go back again."
"authentic italian food and service. the spaghetti vongole tasty, risotto milanese made well and the panzerotti very good. service good, quick and attentive. table close to door spoiled the fun for a few minutes as winter temp. was allowed in. suggestion to already good staff; take even more time to explain food presented. in short; please visit as we will for sure again."
the ice cream here is very good. on a warm day me and my son always go here to buy a cone of the home-made italian ice cre 
"been coming here for years, still havent found my favorite cause the sandwiches are all favorites! the coffee is of good quality, the ice creams very tasty. best option in town!"
"stopped here on a very hot and sunny day for some icecreams and were not dissapointed. located in the center of vleuterweide, this little cafe offers fresh icecreams, sweets and tasty sandwiches."
"small deli with seats for approximately 16 people. we came in at a quiet time and ordered a large bun and a sandwich. unfortunately the spelt bread was sold out, but the waitress asked me politely if it was okay if she made my sandwich with a wholegrain bun instead. fine with me, glad she asked. the bread was fresh, crisp and royally covered. the pastries made me drool, but i didnt try those.. hope someone else will and let me know if they were just as tasty as they looked."
"tasty pizza. can be even better if they add more garlic oil in the bred. other than that, the food is ok. chicken is very good."
lovely pizza very good customer service and delivered very fast. would recommend to everyone. go here every week
"i‚Äôm from albania and i have never eaten at such an amazing restaurant in my life, i want to thank the people who work at new york pizza ‚Äúmaarssen‚Äù for my pizzas thank you so much i love you forever"
i love the american crust pizzas they offer. the 35 cm is good for 2 persond. service and staff very friendly
"i must say this was one of the best pizzas, if not the best pizza i have ever had. their service is amazing and whenever they give you the pizza the walk around and hold the door open for you. this is a place where everyone should go. not only is the food the best. but also the service. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"great pizzas (secret recipe??) and good deals too. you might get addicted :-)  and they have some new flavours now, gyros and chicken avocado. sounds healthy to me.  ps: love their lava cake."
"i love the pizzas, they also have really nice burgers. wil def come back again! also right across the train station. (:"
very nice restaurant above all to sit outside in a sunny day. the italian owner is very professional and polite. pizza is great!
this is a great local restaurant with a interesting and tasty menu featuring various food ranging from local specialities to a dish with 5 different indonesian curries. there is a good selection of beers. the restaurant decor is nice and the bar area is music themed. staff are extremely friendly. the is in the hometown from a work colleague and one of his favorites in the are. i plan to return.
"it was indische avond when we last visited de noot. 3 courses of gorgeous indian food, we ate it all."
"we eat here fairly early on a friday evening in october. it was very quiet but the pizzas were good and the service very friendly,"
ive been there for a pizza and i discover a verry nice restaurant with a good service and a big menu.
"i had visited this restaurant on december 2016. i found it a nice place, lovely workers with a great hospitality and friendly atmosphere. the food was delicious especially the pizza and the shoarma. the prices were very reasonable. we spent a lovely evening there. i hope to return back someday."
the service was paerfect. the waitress was very friendly and poli 
"since i discovered papa johns i can‚Äôt eat other pizzas in amsterdam. the pizza is almost all the times really soft and delicious, tanks also to the unique salsa garlic! but a special thank you to the super positive girl delivering me the pizza by car, sometimes i wait too much but its worth it!!! when you will see her you will forget all the time that you waited, she changed my day a lot of times!"
"very good pizza, i really enjoyed it and recommend it! :) thank you pizzaiolo andrea!!! i will be back."
the best pizza in amsterdam!!!the pizza four cheeses was delicious and creamy!  highly recommended!!!
"the menu at margherita tutta la vita is a celebration of authentic italian cuisine, with a focus on wood-fired pizza and homemade pasta in a funky decoration environment. the ingredients are fresh and of high quality, resulting in dishes that are bursting with flavor. the pizza crust is thin and crispy, with just the right amount of char from the wood-fired oven, and the toppings are generous and full of taste. the pasta dishes are cooked to perfection, with rich and flavorful sauces that are made in-house. each dish is a true taste of italy, and you can tell that the chefs take pride in their craft. the prices are also very decent, 15eur for a pizza in amsterdam? "
pizzas were good but a bit on the expensive side. service was friendly even though it was rush hour. bonus points for multiple vegan options. one of the better options to check out.
"the chairs are sh1tty. the pizza is good. the quality of the pizza is high compared to the low prices, thats great. drinks are a bit small."
we stopped off on the way into diemen suid and the pizza was exceptional. highly recommended and very tasty
"definitely the best pizza in amsterdam! a friend of mine suggested me this place once, but honestly i was sceptical at first after several bad experiences with italian restaurants in the netherlands, which could not give me the feeling i was eating the food of my homeland. this place is different: the vibe, the personnel and the food, they all make me feel like i were back home. if i ever feel homesick, i know this is the place to go!"
"by far the best place in the whole of netherlands. authentic, real passionate food and atmosphere. prices are and quality are italian and far above any dutch standard. check this place out and...you will fall in lov "
"best pizza of my life, nicest people, great team üòç i will warmly recommemd it to everyone! thank you!"
"all the pizzas are really good, never disappointed when eating here. staff is also really friendly. only thing that it can be really noisy"
very very good pizza made with good quality ingredients. the place is full every day of the week so it is good to make a reservation beforehand. other things on the menu are not the best but the pizza beats it.
"real italian taste and atmosfere, amazing pizza and (home made!) pasta :) pizza is made in a traditional way thats why is soooo gooood and unique in amsterdam. stuff is very helpfull, nice and professional, all the time! the prices are very affordable especially when compared to the quality ‚ù§ best place to go! book the table its always busy there! fully recommended üôÇ"
this was quite possibly the best pizza i‚Äôve ever eaten! the staff were incredibly helpful and the food arrived very quickly. my only regret is that i didn‚Äôt take any pictures before wolfing down the food. definitely recommended!
"a really nice casual restaurant! very good prices, quality of food was also excelent, generous portions! totally recommended!"
"quite good for nl. this is not roman or napolitan pizza though. i think the guys running it are calabrians so it is a calabrian version :) spicy, oily and bit crusty. if you want something hot and super filling order their volcano pizza. it will keep u full till next day. "
"welcoming and familiar atmosphere like being in italy. fresh italian and genuine products. spectacular dishes of the authentic italian cuisine. delicious pizzas with low prices. fast and always available staff. highly recommended, not to be missed if you are in the area."
"if you want to have a really taste of italy, that‚Äôs the right place! pizza is outstanding, good quality ingredients, the dough is perfect and the nduja from calabria is super! the tiramisu is next level, so yummy!! the service was nice and italian, attentive, and friendly! the best pizza in amsterdam so far! good job margherita tutta la vita! grazie"
"the family name is secret pizza since it is difficult to find and if you don‚Äôt know of this hidden gem, only worth of mouth will guide you here. that being said, it is well worth the exploration - nothing here disappoints. the staff is friendly and responsive, the pizzas and pasta fresh and absolutely fantastic (and the 2 sizes offered fantastic for families with children), deserts wickedly good (if you have room) and prices incredibly reasonable. in short - no reason to not go, but recommend a reservation as walk-in can be a gamble given the popularity of the place. "
as i live and work close to tutta la vita i come here regularly. i always have a pizza and my favorite is sarenza 
we went there in three for dinn 
this place was great. a hidden jewel. really good pizza. one of the best i have had in a while and a really nice straff! visit this place! üíñ
"the pizzeria is in a students campus, right next to the metro diemen zuid. the location is humble but the food is fantastic. for me stillone of the best and authentic pizzas of amsterdam. you get great food (try also the cannoli for desert!!) for a good price and people are nice and the place is really italian. if i miss italy i go there to eat. fantastici!"
the staff is friendly and greets you even if they are free. the food is lovely and the prices are very good. the best itialian in town!!!
"the restaurant is close to a metro station, out of amsterdam centre. on the wednesday evening we went it was very full and lively. service was friendly and efficient, and the pizzas were delicious. three of the four of us were unable to finish ours as they were such a good size, but the leftovers were packed up for us to take away."
"a great place to sit outside in the sun, and delicious food for a good price! as this is quite a boring neighbourhood, it being mainly residential, i was really happy when these italian heroes came to stay!"
best pizza in the netherlands!!! really welcoming staff and wonderful food!!!!  stefano is the best karaoke limoncello night
"excellent italian food for a decent price. in my opinion normal size pizza can be split for two people (unless you eat a lot on daily basis). crispy, delicious and well prepared. pasta also looks very promising but i didnt had opportunity to try one. i was just a bit disappointed that a couple of positions from pasta menu were unavailable around noon (12:00). polite and helpful staff is working there."
"as an italian i can safely say that i‚Äôve had a lot of pizza in my life, but at margherita tutta la vita it is sooooooo good. i honestly struggle to find a pizza this good in italy let alone in the netherlands. the vibe is great, the staff is great, everything is great! awesome to go with friends, family or even alone!!!"
"i love this pizzeria and their pizza. i love thin and slightly crusty pizza, with carefully thought ingredients. and if you want anything else on your pizza, or you want something left out, no problem whatsoever. the service is always with a smile and there is always the possibility to have a doggy bag if you cant eat all of what you ordered. the pasta is hand made by a lovely lady from bologna, i love her tortelloni. the best pizzeria so far in holland"
my friends introduced me to this place who live in dieme 
we found this as we moved nearby! but wish i had known it earlier! perfect pizza! home made pasta en delicious antipasti! only one risk to become a bit addicted to the pizza! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
christmas lunch. food good but particularly impressed with service - smart enough to start prep of pizzas before we had ordered so food arrived in good time.  good value too.
"great pizzas with fresh, genuine ingredients. perfectly baked in the wood fired oven. some appetizers, homemade pasta and desserts. good simple wines and great beers. we regularly come all the way from amsterdam centre to eat here. my daughter simply loves it. it is the only place in amsterdam really like a local pizzeria in italy: simple, delicious food , friendly and informal service, incredible value for money."
"amazing place!! awesome pizza!! nice environment, friendly staff!! try tiramisu as well!  highly recommended for authentic italian pizzas!"
"often go back to this place for their delicious pizza. it is located near a student campus and thankfully isnt overpriced and is affordable for those on a lower budget. do keep in mind that the place is really busy and its best to make a reservation, otherwise you might end up without a table. their pizzas are made in an authentic pizza oven and the staff are friendly too. not sure about their other courses, only tried the lasagna which was nice as well, but if you had to pick between the two, go for the pizza! their chocolate cake is delicious as well!"
"went there last sunday with my son and family who live in amsterdam. we ate pizza and pasta and it was excellent. the waiter was gracious and helpful, the food, beer and wine was good. the value was also good and we were given three limoncello on the house. will definitely return there, given the chance."
"after searching for a real italian pizza in the amsterdam and surrounding we have finally found a real pizzeria. personnel is very friendly, children are very welcome and pizza is really delicious!"
"visited on sunday afternoon with my wife a daughter, great atmosphere, great service, and food to die for, the pizza where the best i have eaten in amsterdam seeing that i have lived here fo 20 years that‚Äôs some praises, this will defiantly become a regular visit."
"i was in netherlands with my friends, and we were staying in a hotel near this pizzeria. when we first arrived, we went there for lunch. the waiter wasn‚Äôt from netherlands (i think), but he spoke perfect english and knew how to communicate with customers. he was really upbeat, fun, kind-overall, a sweetheart. he even made our pizzas look like hearts. best pizza i had in a long tim "
"margherita tutta la vita is a great place for authentic italian food, conveniently located on campus. their pizzas are fantastic, just like the pizza in italy! i cant fault in any way the food here. there is a great atmosphere here, and the perfect place to relax with friends at the end of a busy day. prices are very student friendl "
"this is a wonderful restaurant, with good food and people. i ud√¨sed to go ones per week because is also cheap. higly recommended love it!!"
really best italian pizza and pasta i ever tried in the netherlands! kind and helpful staff. close to the station.
"the service depends on who is on duty and the way they feel.  when the guy cuts the cheesecake, its super tiny. when one of the ladies cuts the cheesecake, you get what you pay for.  the pizza is always good overhere."
i used to come here almost weekly when i was still working in the neighborhood (and when margherita tutta la vita was still operating from a stand in front of the nearby school 
good pizza - fresh ingredients -  wood oven - nice atmosphere - friendly and young staff - terrace - beer.
great food and atmosphere. good price too. home made pasta. very friendly staff. everything was great!
"very nice selection of pizzas and the dough is good!i prefer a thicker pizza, but its only my taste!"
"together with a group of colleagues we ate here with one of our italian collegaues who loves this place. despite being a large group (around 16) they managed to serve everyone at once. the food was great: fresh, good portions, great flavours. the staff are very friendly and helpful, and even happier if you happen to speak italian. definitely a recommendation for a tasty simple meal."
"looks like a restaurant in italy! good pizza, pasta and salads. will come back. ingredients fresh..."
"amazing pizza, none better around. we usually take out, but this time we ate it there. big difference (crust is perfect.) they have a real wood fire brick oven so they have the best crust. you cannot go wrong with any choice, buffalo bill is our favourite. if you bring it home it does get a bit soggy, so eat fast. :) also, the kids can go get an ice cream, a real cone. they love it."
"one of the best pizzerias in and around amsterdam. real italian pizzas for good prices. try the amico gio or the salame dolce, or the dama bianca. no matter which one you pick, theyre all amazing."
"granted ... it is a little out of the way, but that detour is so worth it. the dough is great, the toppings/combinations innovative but the flavour is unparallel "
"very nice and attentive staff, prices are low and the ice cream is tasty - 5 stars, what else can i say"
"good quality food, but the owned fakes to be an italian .... h√® is not. using honest products and h√® had good teachers"
"thank you so much for a great evening. we were made very welcome and the owner had a lot of time for us, she was very friendly and we will be back to visit. the food was outstanding. we had a starter to share which was antipasti and then homemade lasagna and spaghetti fruits de mare everything was very good. wine, coffee and sambuca was very quality too. thank you sorella we will see you again soon."
had fun with the young guy who goes to liverpool and speaks wonderful english he was really helpful to us a party of german and british. very smart restaurant very clean and stylish and good reasonable food. terrace to sit and watch the people go by. highly recommended 
"sunny and cosy terrace in the heart of sluis, very good and affordable italian snacks and dishes. been here a few times and never dissapoints."
great place to visit. it is a bistro with a small but delicious menu and fast friendly service. just as down to earth as the rest of sluis. enjoy it on a ‚òÄÔ∏è day!
"lovely decor, theyve really made an effort with designing the interior & choosing chairs & colours that are modern, yet co "
we had two marinara pizzas here and they were delicious. we saw other pizzas on other tables and they looked amazing too. the service was friendly and it had a cosy feeling.
the greek restaurant we wanted to go to was closed so we tried this place instead. we werent disappointed as the pasta dishes were very tasty and the portions substantial too.
"so let me start by telling you the food here is delicious and the staff is very friendly abd helpful. everything we ordered looked and tasted delicious. the childrens beefsteak was rare, but we wanted it medium... no problem really, but something you should be aware of. another thing that was really negative (and would have normally deserved negative 2 points) was the state of the toilets... not nice. something like that shouldnt happen to a restaurant of this standing."
"had a great dinner at la sicilia... my dutch friends told me it was good, but i didnt know how much! even better than some italian restaurant in italy! the appetizers were great, fish and meat fresh and good. pasta was really italian and pizza was also very goo "
"the family run a very fine restaurant with quality products, partly supplied by their own super delicatessen across the street. wonderful cheeses, hams and a variety of good sausages and much more recommended !! ."
we called in here during or corso visit. they fitted us in upstairs where 6 of liberally embibed may not have been the best guest 
"we were driving on our bike to rooterdam en when we came back we were very hungry and went to this restaurant. there were not many man to eat, but it was cozy. the pizza which we ordered was perfect en more than enough. just go here and enjoy."
"a real pleasure. delicious simple italian food in a pleasant atmosphere. a top vitello tonnato and superb grilled lamb. decent quality chardonnay at an affordable price. light, airy, cosy decor. owner came to our table to see if all was ok. all-in-all good food at good value with attentive service."
"nice italian food. very generous portions. decor a bit old fashionned, maybe. cuisine is classical italian food, well prepared and served in generous portions. we especially liked the carpaccio, the lasagna and the basilicum cr√®me br√ªl√©e."
"had dinner here in july 2016. there is a nice, big terrace in front of the restaurant. we first had a drink at this terrace before we went inside. we had a nice table in the patio. the outside area on th backside of the restaurant is protected from rain and win "
"it is hard, if no impossible, to find genuine italian food abroad. and here you are...in the middle of nowhere, adjacent to a vacation resort, pops up this place that gets pretty close to the real thing. of course, they cater to a vast majority of dutch and german tourists and they have to keep that into account. but still: the pastas a pretty close to the original recipes, the pizzas are as close as youll get in holland and - believe it or not - even the espresso is a genuine, italian tasting espresso, as opposed to the muck one gets served too often in the netherlands. so bravo all over. biggest disappointment: kitchen closes extremely early."
fairly good italian food. the large round tables were well suited for group conversations during dinner. the food was served quickly after ordering. i could recommend the spaghetti corbonara and the saltimbocca with fries as a side dish.
"nice restaurant next to the complex office. friendly staff,and a good menu for all tastes. the lasagna was excellent. good choice of wines by the glass. friendly staff."
nice & quit place to have some ice cream and or coffee. very friendly staff with good service. i would recommend them and i would go back for some more ice cream.
"i am from australia and doing a european tour with my wife and i must admit i ate like in italy, especially the pizza ,just like the napolitano pizza, and there staff were courteous . i will certainly return."
"our favorite restaurant! the combination of great italian food and warm, friendly and personal staff & ownership makes this a place you‚Äôd want to visit over and over again (which we do). the chef is italian and the ownership is partly italian, which makes the restaurant stand out. you will not find all traditional ‚Äúdutch italian‚Äù dishes but instead you‚Äôll notice a variety of local and creative italian deliciousness! the wines are good, let charlotte advise you! so if you‚Äôre up for a great night our with local italian food and staff that just knows how to make your evening amazing, you should definitely go here."
"we went here for dinner several times already, and the food is always delicious. what makes this place even better, is the staff; they‚Äôre always super friendly and very personal. prices are very acceptable, especially given what you get for it in terms of food and service. be sure to take some time when dining here; you can easily spend several hours, as the atmosphere is just great. an absolute recommendation; you should definitely go for dinner here when you‚Äôre visiting reeuwijk (or surrounding villages, such as bodegraven and gouda)."
"great new owners for the italian restaurant  in reeuwijk. nice service, good menu all at your door steps and open on mondays all at reasonable pricing !!!  worth exploring and enjoying."
"very good italian restaurant in the city center of drunen. the food is just amazing, so are the wines. service is super friendly and has lots of knowledge. and all this for very reasonable prices.  you can call this a hidden gem of drunen."
there used to be a different restaurant on this spot but since a while there is an italian restaurant at the corner of the central square in drunen and it is more plush than the name la cantina suggests. it has nice seats and tables for different sizes of parties and only when you are with 6 or more people it is necessary to make a reservation. in front of the restaurant there is also a big terrace outside overlooking the square with plenty of sunshine (because it is situated southward 
great italian food where you wouldnt expect it. nice views of the river in the summer and terrace. you may need to book though. the food was great and affordable.
"very lovely choice between hot and cold small dishes, as much as you can eat. with a tasty desert table to finish with a white and brown chocolate fountain. good service and nice atmosphere."
"not knowing what to expect, it was double pleasure when one is explained the concept of the restaurant: it is all one can eat but in a luxe offering! the menu card has about 17 entrees, about 23 main dishes and the dessert buffet very complete! every dish presented in a very elegant way, tasting delicious and making you want for more, which is great as one can just keep on ordering üòä! and... everything (except dessert) is brought to the table, so the relaxing atmosphere and comfortable seating arrangement provided is not interrupted! we had a very nice evening and for sure shall return!"
"we had a great evening! the location is good, it was easy to park, the staff was very friendly. i was most impressed with the food , a new concept of all you can eat! the food was deliciously and the presentation was very good. it is worth to come here again! you won‚Äôt be regret it."
"food is always amazing, great selection of really good wines and the service surpasses that of any dutch restaurant"
we went there with a family of 5. had some awesome food and the staff is very nice and caring. have been here a couple times and the take away food is also nic 
"the outside differs totally from the inside..almost a hidden gim.. we had scampis as a starter, deer as main (very delicious) and tiramisu to end. presentation can be better but you dont expect it in this kind of restaurants. friendly staff!"
under the smoke of rotterdam excellent food for a reasonable price. extensive food and beverage menu very friendly service. life entertainment. ample parking
great italian restaurant and we ate there for two nights. excellent welcome from sharon who couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. delicious food all round. pizzas are enormous! penne carbonara is highly recommended. thank you for two excellent evenings.
"we went for dinner and had a nice time. the staff were friendly and efficient. the food was very tasty. i had the pizza which i thoroughly enjoyed although it was very large so i couldn‚Äôt finish it, but they offered me a takeaway box so i could finish it later."
pizza is definitely to recommend. looking forward to try other stuff. only one remark: inner space need a little renovation. maybe more modern look?
"we were there on a tuesday evening where every pizza is 7,50‚Ç¨. we came in and the restaurant was quite full. later we recognized wh "
"went to have dinner and we both ordered pizza. pizza was very good, typically italian. its a good restaurant with gentle owners, they always like to chat with costumers."
"for me the best italian restaurant in the netherlands. i live close by and its the only place i go for pizza, pasta and really great quality meat and fish. i usually take one of the fish or meat plates as i can take pizza to go. the mix grill is also supper yummy. tuesdays very busy so i would recommend wednesday or thursda "
"the food is great!, lovley family restaurant , must visit if you are in the area. sardinian food is just great!. wines from sardinia are simply the best"
"good pizza, friendly service, nice terrace, the noisy trains passing by is the only negative i can think of. worth a visit if you are passing by."
went here as two couples and a baby. the owners were friendly and helpful. service was great and food was delicious. the chef even made more for my friend (no request) as they felt the portion was too small! would recommend to anyone who wants an authentic italian meal.
we stayed in a hotel next to this restaurant and we came one evening to have some appetizer only. so we selected cured beef and pork from starters section of me 
we were arriving in the hoek by ferry and i pre-booked breakfast at this restauran 
found that restaurant by chance when stranded in hoek van holland for a day. we could go and have a family meal and not to have to leave our dog behind in the hotel. service superb. menu quite varied. presentation excellent and dishes delicious. would visit again for sure.
"this has to be the best restaurant we have ever visited. it is modern, clean and has excellent service, the menu has something for everyone. our food was out of this world. please visit this restaurant and you will not be disappointed."
"this has to be the nicest restaurant we have eaten in! we have eaten in many restaurants all over the world and honestly, this topped them all!! excellent service, modern and clean. we had a starter of crab/avocado and charcuterie and our main meal consisted of fillet steak and fried risotto with goats cheese. the steak was done perfectly and the risotto was so tasty, nothing can compare. we had a house red. this is a must. the staff were very attentive and friendly."
"with nearly 3 hours to wait for our return ferry to harwich we decided to go into the town for a meal, to avoid the taste restaurant on the stena britannica. the only decent looking restaurant (italian) is closed on monday & tuesday and we didnt like the look of the egyptian so we decided to try the gentile restaurant in the grand hotel. we were pleasantly surprised. we had the two vegetarian options on the menu and these were both excellent, as was the glass of beer. the staff all spoke english and were very helpful. the bill came to just over ¬£20 each - very reasonable."
"with a few hours to spend before our ferry trip to england, it was time for dinner in the hook of holland. when in doubt, look for a trip advisor sticker on the door and i am so glad we dined at the gentile restaurant at the grand hotel. service was fast, friendly, and professional from multi-lingual staff. and the food was superb and a beautiful surprise in both taste and appearance. one could view the chef adding garnishes to the plates at the kitchen servery before they were whisked away to diners and what care he took. my thinly sliced scallops with tender squid entree was exquisite. meals are honest with no excess clashing of flavours."
"i did not like the two man a little bit to close to our table speaking very loud a language that seems to be from south germany and drinking to much big beers,"
we were guests in the grand hotel associated with this restaurant. we were intending to just have a drink in the outside area but were tempted by the very friendly staff to take a look at the menu. this turned out to be a great mo 
"good food. real italian. i can especially recommend the meat and fish dishes. fair pricing. they dont have a wide variety of wines, but they do have some good ones."
"went there with colleagues, and most had the tournedos with a specific sauze. the waiter had alot of problems figuring out what sauze was on what plate (they look alike), not really a problem ofcourse, but it was fun. the food was really exeptionally good. service was great. even got a limoncello on the house."
we had the best pizza the service is was outstanding food good and the wine is top of the range we are happy to recommend this place for any occasion and urge readers to look no further
"i ordered home delivery: parmigiana di melanzane, pizza marinara, cannoli siciliani and a dish out of their standard menu:mozzarella in carrozza. my mother is from a little village close to naples and makes the best parmigiana di melanzane in the world. gigino parmigiana di melanzane is as delicious as the one of my mother. excellent. pizza is fresh, thin in the center and soft and crunchy on the sides, respecting ingredients and consistency as per tradition. is the first time i am served in the netherlands a real pizza marinara even better than many pizzas i ate in italy. mozzarella in carrozza outside layer is done according to tradition, crunchy, and tasty as it should be. very good. looking forward to taste all of their dishes from naples tradition. recommended for takeaway and home delivery during these days of covid special measures. "
"this small cafeteria is located in downtown berschenhoek. while mostly for take-away, they are an excellent choice to stay for a nice dinner if you dont feel for the full blown restaurant experien "
"this is a mindfully designed gem: the right decor, down to the details, an impressive yet cozy bar, the perfect mix of jazz music to complete the ambiance. even sitting outside feels like being transported to the 1920s, everything slows down , one is overcome by a relaxed and joyful feeling. the cocktails are amazing and the borski beer is delicious! the food is nicely presented and everything is fresh and tasty. i love that the portions arent huge so its possible to taste several different dishes. the service is superb."
fabulous dinner in a beautiful art deco style environment. dishes were good for sharing and our absolute favorite was the dish with a creme br√ªl√©e of duck liver. the waiters were very nice and one of them gave really good wine advice to accompany the various dishes (both the red and white macon villages were excellent). the restaurant is just outside haarlem and definitely worth the detour!
this was the second time we eat at the restaurant and it was very good the first time. but the wedding  food and service was outstanding  i would recommend this for any large function
"stayed at the oranjerie for a business meeting. the location is great, situated in a park of an old mansion. the atmosphere in the old building is relaxing, the staff is very good and always present on a pleasent discrete way. the lunch and diner were very good. the coffee was however less. one of the disatvantadges of this location is the location of the parking lot. you have to park at about 8 to 10 walking minutes away (depending on the amount of rain). at the parking site the direction to the oranjerie is signed very very poor so the possibilityu is that you get lost in the park."
what a dream! this is the most italian part of italy in the netherlands. it is hidden quite well so you must really know where you‚Äôre going but it is absolutely worth the effort. we had spaghetti with shrimps and a pizza. i was blown away by the refined taste. we sat outside in the lovely garden where fresh herbs and spices are grown. the garden is a 1000 square meter representation of heaven. should you be in neighbouring zoetermeer or gouda - make sure you‚Äôll venture out to buon gusto in moerkapelle. trust me : it will be a night to remember!
"this medium-sized restaurant is a hidden gem in moerkapelle. looking for some ice-cream on a sunny afternoon, we stumbled upon an ice-cream cart with a tastefully decorated outside area and restaurant behind it. olive and oak trees were growing, with nice tables and parasols in between. at the back is a small wooden cubbyhouse for the children and an elaborate herb and flower garden where you can walk through. the staff are friendly and happy to make a chat. the ice-cream was nice and cheap, although you do get quite a small portion and there are only 4 choices, but the children were happy with it. we had a cappuchino and a coffee latte, both tasteful. in the end, it turned out to be a great place to have a break and relaxed time with the kids. for a moment it feels like you step out of holland and straight into romantic italy :-)"
"great food, very friendly staff and so happy we found a place for diner around 9pm. thanks for the service!"
took a chance and did not regret it. friendly staff and food was piping hot and delicious. both cannelloni and the restaurants signature dish were plentiful and worth a try.
good selection of italian food. we all had pizza and was a hit with us all especially the kids. service was good and the waiting staff made a real effort to engage with us
stumbled on this when walking around eersel and so glad we did. such good value and the most amazing ice cream selection. people seemed to be driving there just for an ice cream and you could see why. we ended up visiting another 3 times while staying nearby as the kids loved it
"worth the extra mile to get there - the selection is great, the taste of the ice cream excellent. we (5 adults) all left with the same judgement - we will come back next time we are in the area!"
"there was a bit of a line for this ice cream store but it was well worth it. the ice cream is fab, with lots of different and interesting flavours. i also got a cappuccino but that was just pretty avera "
the ice cream is wonderful.  a lot of different tastes! if you are in eersel you must definitely try this ice cream.
this has to be the best ice cream shop in existence! it‚Äôs teally reasonably priced (less than 2 euros for 2 large scoops of ice cream) and there are so many flavours to choose from. the staff speak english and you can try before you buy. best thing- if you order a coffee you also get s tiny little ice cream cone too!
"this is the best place where i ate ice-cream. they have so many tastes, its very hard to choose :) in 4 years i have tried them all <3  this is definitely a place not to miss if you are in brabant."
we searched round eersel for a quiet and reasonably priced place to eat. spotted eethuis amun and although it did not seem to be great surroundings we were very pleasantly surprise 
"i really liked the cooking,the service and the atmosphere.i will back for sure!!! i was with my family"
"small but cosy italian place. real woodfire oven and terrific pizzas. also small mennu with pastas, antipasti etc."
"we had a walking dinner, the quality and quantity were what excellent, good variety, different tastes."
as a regular guest of the bar and restaurant in the steigenberger hotel i was made aware by the hotel staff about the italian restaurant there is in the hote 
"very nice tortellini and wine..! i visit the restaurant with my girlfriend and we had a very relaxing evening. the decoration,the food but also the amazing service from a true italian woman. i recommend this place as they really know what they doing..!!"
stopped for a baquette and drinks before boarding our flight. service was ok despite only being one member of staff working but it was early in the morning. good selection of food and drinks.
"it was a pleasant surprise to find a jamie oliver outlet in amsterdam‚Äôs schipol airport following the collapse of his jamie‚Äôs italian empire in the u.k. some excellent breakfast baps with bacon and a crispy ham and cheese croissant. counter service was a tad slow,"
"the food and coffee was good. there are outlets for charging and plenty of seating. staff were only ok. the young guy who waited on us was inattentive and appeared bored. i had a ham & cheese croissant which was a bit small, but was flaky, cheesy and very tasty. hubby had a ham & cheese toasty which was also good. we shared a caramel muffin and each had a latte."
"shocked by the 2 star review as the experience i had was outstanding! i had a delicious margarita pizza, can honestly say the best i‚Äôve ever had. mouth wateri "
as far as an airport lunch goes it was fantastic.   food good fresh and warm.   a little more attention to tidying tables and wiping them down although people start sitting before you kind of leave.
excellent selection of foods. fresh and reasonably priced compared to other restaurants at t3 departures. staff helpful and friendly.
i have been helped greatly by nice people who knew how to make coffee!  made my day just before boarding!
food was good enough for airport food. we were served by tina who smiled and danced and made us happy :)
really good tuna sandwich along with ceaser salad and pepperoni pizza all nicely served by ella and shanti
"can i please take a moment to express my pleasure to have visited this place before my flight. thank you gilles, lenisha and dominique - you were super friendly. to be frank, this is the first time i get such a warm hospitality at an airport cafe/restaura "
"i had the penne bolognese, a chocolate brownie and orange smoothie.  the menu choices were limited but the food itself was delicious and great value for money.  ellen & gilles were both very friendly and helpful."
"was a pleasure between all the fast food stands.  if you look further then the obvious pizza slices and lasagna there are healthy salads, well prepared baguettes and more.  lovely staff like ellen and gilles. they make you feel welcome!"
"i had a pasta, really good and tasty. i saw a couple of other dishes, they looked tasty and lovely also. definitely coming back. service is nice and pleasant. thank you"
took my kids here for dinner while waiting for our next flight. the pasta and pizza were delicious! prices were good too. ellen and majid were so kind and friendly. we stayed quite awhile but they didn‚Äôt mind at all! highly recommend!
tina was very professional and assisted in providing us delicious food during my transit through the netherlands. i definitely recommend jamie‚Äôs deli to anyone especially when tina is there providing service.
the food was good. the green smoothie was amazing but the best was the service!  easy stop inside the airport
tina served me and was very polite and friendly. food was ok‚Ä¶ could be warmer. coffee and orange juice very good.
"ive just stumbled upon this place at the airport, sad and hungry. eating the mushroom pizza felt like a hug. probably one of the best pizzas ive ever had, and also the first try of jamie olivers recipe. it is about the simpe things indeed"
"open, distanced, comfortable seating. food was delicious (i had the pork sandwich). ellen‚Äôs service was fast and nice."
"i was amazed by the english breakfast meal served by dominque and giels. moreover, the seats and caf√© were clean."
"proposed by an italian friend, this place offers a different take on schiphol‚Äôs restaurant scene. affordable and tasty food and excellent service by tina & simone!"
remi and dominique were friendly and efficient and the small english breakfast tastes like it came from a classic english b&b
veggie breakfast with toast and an americano  coffee.  very nice indeed. clean and well set out restaurant  friendly staff.
"excellent service and cooking from dominique and gilles. everything on point sharp at 7am, i was the first customer."
"dominique was helpful and friendly! veggie breakfast was great, lots of vegetarian options, plenty of space to sit and relax :-)"
malisca and gilles were fantastic friendly hosts the funghi pizza was delicious thank you  maryclare and dennis
great fresh food served with a smile. loved the pizza and my husband enjoyed breakfast. recommend it highly.
"due to imposed covid measures i‚Äôve stuck in the airport for two days and maybe for 2-3 days more, during this time i had some of my meals at jamies italian, and when they (sophia and melissa) found out i was in this situation they not only gave me a discount for my meals but even offered to leave the airport to purchase fresh food to bring back and prepare for me. i was speechless to say the least at the kindness and generosity that was shown and don‚Äôt have enough kind words for them. they went above and beyond their jobs and i wish nothing but the best for these kind and beautiful soul "
"my husband and i went while waiting for our fly. i totally recommend to search for rachel, she is very kindy and helpful"
i was today at jamie oliver with my friends. we had orderd 3 lasagne it was delicys. a big men came to table ask us if we can write something at tripadvise. it was delicys thank you also for the potatos big men :)üòú
had delicious tuna and salad baguettes from here at not too bad prices at all. server at the til was very friendly and the drinks were hot and tasty too. lots of choice to eat.clean tables and plenty of seating. whats not to like
"really friendly, great service from mo. really clean and great drink selection- made very comfortable xx"
"this place is most likely an airport restaurant, good food and quick service. its way better then the ranking"
"based on the reviews here, id avoid the full-service sit-down meals and just grab a sandwich. we took two sandwiches from a prepared foods cooler -- a ham and cheese and a chicken salad. both were large and delicious. add to that two bags of potato chips and a couple of bottles of water and they were all we needed before boarding our flight. we ate in the waiting area at the gate. totally satisfactory."
"food was good. staff helpful. i feel bad for lydia, i accidentally spilled my food but she was very kind and helped me out."
"waiting for a connecting flight, this was a good choice.friendly staff, and a good assortment of food ideas. typical airport prices, but quality was good."
"ate here before fight home to stansted, it is what it is, a snack stop, not a restaurant, so dont expect full blown meals and is canteen style service. i am celiac so after living mainly on salads in amsterdam for the weekend where catering for gluten free wasnt great, i was pleased to see they had my fave, parmigiana di melanzane, on the menu. a good decent square is served up with some rocket salad and parmesan. is served up in like a cardboard bucket type thing which makes it a little tricky to eat, with plastic knives and forks, but was totally delicious. their pizzas looked amazing. my niece had a baguette which she said was really good."
"i had a great aubergine with parmesan cheese with a red wine. i really enjoyed it, specially after having so much bread and cheese. the place is a semi-fast food and offers pizzas and other stuff. not bad for the type of place."
called in here for breakfast when flying back to exeter. i opted for the complete breakfast which was served efficiently by very obliging staff. the food itself was both hot and delicious with a bit of heat and lots of herbs. really enjoyed it. what isn‚Äôt so great is the way it is served. basically it is served in a round carton usually seen as cinemas when buying pick and mix sweets. the consequence of this is that a pile of food is piled on top of itself so what should look like a really nice breakfast just looks like a mess. there are only plastic knives and forks and so as i dived in to try and get a piece of the cumberland sausage which was right at the bottom of the carton the fork broke! can i please ask you to consider the plate for such a breakfast. i know it‚Äôs not trendy or cool but it makes food look good and how you serve it now detracts from the taste. 
had a lovely penne pasta was yummy with rocket and parmesan and a lovely cup of team nice seating area and my friends enjoyed their pizza slices with balsamic oil and olive oil on every table. nice place
just had a lovely breakfast in jamies deli at schipol airport while waiting for our transfer. theres no vegan breakfast listed but everything is cooked in olive oil and i requested no eggs. dominique was lovely and asked how our meal was.
"food was so so yummy, fairly cheap considering its an airport place. tina served us both and was very sweet and lovely"
actually the food (aubergine) was very good. the service was friendly but i didnt get a napkin and forgot to ask. the tables are being cleaned as i write and they werent that b 
"a bit pricey, but so good! loved it, especially the tiny potatoes, and pulled pork was also spicy and there was a lot."
"lovely pizza have it every time we go home big hot square of margarita the mushroom one is nice to, handy always have it every time we go to airport."
"this is an airport food experience...and i was not expecting much but when i got the full breakfast i enjoyed it...especially their sausage. i would pick this spot over many at the airport...fast, filling and above average."
"a solid bbq pulled pork that saved my time in schiphol - reasonable place and nice. pleasant staff, almost forgot i was in an airport for the course of the meal."
i work on schiphol amsterdam airport. i went to jamies deli a couple of times for my dinner break. i chose this place because its relatively quite compared to other parts on the airport. food is good. especially can recommend the aubergine and superfood salad. also ordered a slice of fungi pizza. had to wait for a few minutes for this - once it arrived it was hot and fresh. pricing is quite steep. dont expect a bargain. airports are never cheap. service is friendly and there is free naturally flavored water to take.
"only one word, breakfast was great !!! especially the sausage was too delicious. when i fly again , i will taste this breakfast again !!!"
cheese toastie was hot but had retained the crispiness of toasted bread - did not go soggy.  nice airy restaurant on top level of airport near gate f3.  tables were spaced well apart which gave it a welcome feeling of calm.
i had a bacon sandwich for breakfast and drank a cappuccino. both the sandwich and the coffee were good. they made the place very nice to sit despite the fact that you are in a large airport.
"a small, un-pretentious italian restaurant in heemstede serving tasty italian food for a very good price. the surroundings are modest but the food is very good. service is very friendly."
"more than passable italian food with a dutch-touch (this is holland so manage your expectations!). pizzas are reasonable (not really what you would get in italy), and the rest of the menu offers a good choice. decent wine choice. very polite servi "
"this is a great restaurant for people who love pizza and pasta.  the pizzas were great, and you just had to finish all of it.  i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
"this was a great restaurant near where we stayed.  there was very friendly service and great food.  we were seated right next to the pizza oven, and got to watch our pizza get made."
nice and cozy place. on the main street of heemstede. fine ambiance and very good service. ideal place to meet with friends.
"my wife realy enjoys this italian restaurant, it is child friendly and the staff is very helpful. there is also an older italian man which is really focusing on details and customer experience so all with all this is our favorite restaurant near our home!"
"weve been to la via numerous times and have always enjoyed our meal.  homemade, tasty, and at a very reasonable price.  the service is very good and their menu selections are many."
"i was there on business dinner. menu is real great, but without english translation. so some of meals you have to guess as the waitress also didnt speak english. anyway nothing to claim about food, it was fresh, wonderful scallops and real well made ravioli. i think it is right place for family dinner , but fits also for business lunch or dinner. parking is possible on the street free after 6pm."
"i take out every other week and love their pizzas! my wife always takes the parmigiana. when eating in, the pastas (gorgonzola) saltinbocca and salmone diavola are my favorite. limoncello as dessert. :)"
"i have been here a few times over the last 4 years and it hasnt changed much. the menu is authentic, the bruschetta is awesome and so is the melanzane parmiagiana. the pizza and other pasta offerings have also been appreciated by my companions in the past ( i have been here with real italians and they liked i "
this restaurant was a real surprise to  
"it is not every day that you find such a good place! the food was unbelievably fresh, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming and the takeaway looked so delicious that i had to try it and i am glad i did! its fantastic!!! will definitely visit again. "
"the pasta box is part restaurant, part delicatessen. the front of the restaurant serves as a delicatessen where people are able to buy take-away fresh italian food. the same delicatessen also supplies food to the restaurant if and when required. the restaurant has a very good cook who prepares fresh italian food to order. the menu changes monthly. we had broccoli & gorgonzola soup, sea bass with fresh pasta, a vegetarian spaghetti dish, chocolate cake & a cheese platter. the pasta was very fresh & the fish very nice - the chocolate cake was moist and excellent. there is a varied wine list with some wines available by the glass. i had a very nice montepulciano dabruzzo & a sangiovese/merlot combination which was very pleasant & went very well with the food. a restaurant to recommend & to return in the near future."
"tony has been a masterchef for decades now, and it shows: terrific wine, a thoughtful crew and above all an excellent menu filled with the best culinary ideas. a visit to the pasta box is one to remember, and highly recommended!"
a lunch at the pasta box whether it be with a friend or with a large group is  a culinary pleasure. it is not a stiff formal restaurant but a friendly local restaurant to which one is happy to return to.
it is a nice dinner but i found it a bit expensive. nice service and environment. i recommend it for dinner
i visited here with family amd friends in october and have to say we enjoyed a wonderful meal and a very warm welco 
"we were here for a cappucino, which was excellent, and decided to have antipasto della casa. very nice too. it appears they also have a restaurant that we will try out next time."
we have gotten takeout from here a few times. always fresh and delicous tasting varieties indeed. one of our favourite spots in heemstede
"tony and his chefs prepare tasty, italian based dishes. nice spot for lunch and dinner, but i use it mostly as trattoria (take-out). good dishes and great desserts."
"everything around pasta is here available!!  excellent qualify, fantastic choice, well prepared and.... nice atmosphere !"
"what a nice surprise to eat here! i thought you can only have lunch in de pasta box, but you can also have dinner there. there are nice tables located in the rear, and me and my friends had a delicious dinner last thursday. we also took food for the following day, that was excellent. i surely go again! "
i love this place ! it is a shop selling all kinds of italian goodies..and you can eat there as well ! im a big fan of their salads but also the rest of their menu is worth while. great place to have in heemstede !
the owner who is also the chef works on his own and can handle about 20 guests. the food is very good and tasteful.
"even though we were delayed we received a warm welcome. the setting is wonderful with tables in a spacious shop. house white and red are good. we started with a salad with artichoke hearts, olives and tomatoes and a well-balanced dressing followed by saltimbocca. the latter included excellent quality veal expertly cooked. lovely experience. first-class ingredients professionally cooked and smiling service!"
"the restaurant is the continuation of restaurant delizia and is an asset for heemstede. i had a business lunch yesterday and had an excellent pasta with grilled veggies. it is less formal, and the prices and very reasonable. make sure to reserve a table as there are not many tables and all were occupied. and thats a good sign. pleasant and friendly sta "
"unexpected restaurant at the back of a delicatessen in heemstede. we were curious and gave it a try and were pleasantly surprised. three courses for 23,50‚Ç¨. we had a very good carpaccio, saltimbocca, tiramisu (spectacularly good - judged by my italian girlfriend..), home made by the chef/ owner. very good price / quality; we will definitely go back."
"this started off as a lunch restaurant ,+ take home italian prepared food,+sale of some typical italian delectables. recently, summer 2014, de pasta box has opened its doors for dinners 6 nights a week. it has a non complicated attractive italian choice of dishes and cooked by tony it cannot go wrong. there is a wonderful lemon cheese cake ,not to be beaten. an enjoyable venue with a relaxed ambiance and not over the top with prices."
"under the dutch intelligent lock down rules, it is still possible to take away an ice cream at toscana. there is a separated entry and exit enabling one way traffic, and there are indicators on the floor to keep the required 1.5 meters distance. the ice cream itself is still fantastic as before!"
great ice cream and also possible to get ice cream in cones that are gluten free.  great tasting ice cream!
large shop with a lot of different flavors. my personal favorite: limone- basilicum. wish they sold it in more ice creamshops!   would recommend the place and it is a nice spot to take a rest and watch people.
this place is opposite the drents museum ansd has the largest choice of ice-tasts i have ever met. sit inside or outside and enjoy your choice of icecream. it will not be easy to make your final choice. good luck. recommended!.
toscana is a new italian icecream parlor in assen on the brink. it serves a wide variety of icecream tastes and has a great terrace to sit outside and eat the icecream in the sunshine. we really enjoyed our icecreams here!
the carbonara made by the owner was hands down one of the best i have tried! full of flavour. friendly and professional service. reasonable prices.
"we went to bella italia on a friday evening. early june, so, a bit chilly, but the terrace it was. the atmosphere was buzzing, the sharing starter and wine great, the pizza decent and the desserts lovely. a very nice evening out in the centre of assen."
"lovely italian restsurant. service is very friendly. fresh ingredients, lovely italian tastes. wines available by glass."
"delicious italian meals. terrace is big and busy, if you like it quiet you need to go indoors. dinner portions are good, but desserts are huge! service was good as well."
"excellent pasta, great service. recommend a visit.. decent beer menu, house wine was average however."
"beautiful restaurant, absolutely divine food and the portion sizes were amazing! the meal and wine were something i would love to repeat, truly lovely.  the service was friendly and quick.  great restaturant."
"the worlds best pizza, crispy from edge to middle, fresh ingredients - simply delicious! the dessert was excellent and the red wine was great! 5 stars are more than deserved."
"we often stay in assen but had never visited this restaurant.  now we know what they do, we will return when we are in the region again.  good portions of very tasty food.  the sharing starter looked lovely and all was very fresh."
whilst we were in assen we were taken to this restaurant the service was excellent and food food amazing prices can be a little more tha say run of the mill pizzas places but well worth it if your in assen its a must
"atmosphere was great from the start - busy and happy with good ambiance, english menu was welcome and pizzas were truly delicious. would recommend highly. thank you everyone!"
this is a beautiful restaurant. they have a lot of space so i think its suitable for big groups of people. you can sit indoors and out and the menu has lots of different things to choose from. staff is very friendly and notices when you want to ask something. they are very polite and humble and prices are about right. its not the cheapest but you can tell they really put effort into their meals and how they present them.
"there are lots of italian restaurants but only a few are really great at combining good food, a bustling warm friendly atmosphere and good serving staff. add reasonable pricing, inside and outside dining and bella italia scores on every account. pizza and pasta of all types with real taste and desserts to die for.. see photo of the mixed desert selection plate. worth planning a visit if you are on holiday in the area ( the locals are there already)."
"first of all: make reservations; always very busy. you can sit inside the restaurant (very noisy), but theres also a heated terrace outside.  quality of food is very good, staff very nice."
we came here to have a nice dinner and a chat. apart from the rainy weather there were absolutely nothing to complain abou 
"in the citycentre of assen this nice italian restaurant is located with both regular and terras seating opportunities. the resataurant offers a nice choice of italian dishes. we only ordered pizzas, which were of one of the best qualities we ever had (including restaurants in italy "
"good house wine and tasty food. busy but really nice. for two pizzas and one pasta and a bottel of rose, i paid ‚Ç¨53. good value for your money."
"food good, service excellent. the only down side tables very close to one another. had to wait quite a while to be served and long wait for food to arrive. it was a busy saturday night though"
"we had a very nice dinner here recently. the place is popular...for a reason....good italian food at reasonable prices. it has a busy, but pleasant, atmosphere."
we had a lovely appetizer and meal.  there are many unique pizzas available.  the staff were helpful and spoke english well.
"this restaurant has very extensive menu with something to suit all. delicious italian food served in a pleasant outdoor area. good service, staff very pleasant and helpful. offered alternative seats when the person next to us started to smoke. efficient but given time to relax and enjoy the very tasty meal. definitely worth a visit. "
"we ate here at about 6pm on a tuesday night expecting it to be quiet and it was absolutely packed! luckily we were able to be seated on a table for 2 right by the window. we ordered carpaccio and olives to start. carpaccio was lovely but could have done with slightly more dressing. for mains i had a steak dish with balsamic and my husband had a pork dish with mushrooms. we both enjoyed them, though my husband felt his dish had far too much sauce and would have been served in a side jug. but thats personal preference. the atmosphere felt like an authentic italian and the service was very good. we will be returning."
"we ate here, my husband had pizza & i had the lasagne it was delicious. we sat outside, all the tables had patio heaters & blanket were provide for you legs such a nice touch"
"pizzas are very good. if you are not very hungry, you can order  one pizza for 2. they also have a nice choice of wines."
allways very busy so dont forget to make a reservation. lovely environment and good hospitality. also very nice food!!
"we had a delicious pizza, sitting outside on a summer evening. the restaurant was busy as it was sunday after the motorcycle races, but the staff was friendly and helpful and the pizza as good as in italy. we shared the pizza and a large garden salad, with beer..pure heaven!"
"we have been here on several occasions. for starters we always take the bread & garlic butter. delicious main courses, especially the scallopa and pizzas. the kids really liked the desser "
"weve been coming here pretty regularly since our friends introduced us to it. the place is always packed, even on monday nights, but even so, service is quick and friendly. the pizzas are great, with generous amounts of toppings but the place serves more than that. pastas and meat dishes are just as good and the portions are gigantic, you won‚Äôt go hungry here. save some space for the desserts though, they are very tasty indeed and considerably better than anything served at your ‚Äòregular‚Äô italian restaurant."
if you ever have the pleasure of visiting assen then i really recommend this restaurant . as soon as you walk in you are greeted with delicious smells and a warm welcome 
"the bella italia is a fairly large italian restaurant on the market square opposite de nieuwe kolk in assen. apart from pizzas they serve a fairly large menu of italian food, including fish and meat dishes. despite being quite full on a thursday evening the service was quick, food arrived quickly enough as well. red house wine was delicious and a large glass full and came with a generous bread basket with garlic butter. tap water came at no additional cos "
"hubby ordered a pizza capricciosa , while i had the spaghetti bella italia and they were excellent. the only downside was that our appetizers were forgotten and i had to call back our waitress to remind her. what was annoying was that she kept passing our table already and simply didnt remember we were supposed to have appetize "
"since i live in italy, finding a good pizzeria in the netherlands is not always easy. usually, i try to avoid any pizzeria here, but i came here with a group of colleagues, so basically had to. i must say i was pleasantly surprised! i went for a simple napoletana, and the ingredients on the pizza are fresh, which is a good sign, and also the dough was of good quality. this was also the case on the pizzas of my colleagues even the frutti di mare with fish. also, it was a thursday before christmas and the place was packed, so apparently a popular restaurant. if youre in assen and youre looking for a good pizza, i would recommend this place."
eat here when we come over to assen for the bsb and world superbikes food always excellent staff always friendly and helpful explaining the menu in english to us highly recommend a visit from tom and eve
"a group of us called in late on saturday evening, we were warmly welcomed and shown to our table. we ordered 2 starters of mixed cheese and meat with fresh warm bread and 2 large spicy pizza topped with cheese salami and chillies. they were delicious fresh and piping hot, all washed down with cold lager. the staff were very helpful and friendly."
"i am a vegan ,also my family is vegan or vegetarian. this is no problem in this restaurant, you can change the ingredients of the pizza. you can also change the ingredients of the pasta. there is a lot of choise of pizzas en other food."
"great meal, great service. but what was very surprising, after dinner i had a cappuccino but went outside for a cigarette.  the moment i came back they replaced the old cappuccino with a new one. thats what i call service!"
there¬¥s a lot of choice and good food here. you can sit in- and outside. the personnel is friendly. it is possible to sit a while and talk after you are finished eating your food :)
we had a meal at this restaurant two night in a row as food was great. service great and friendly staff. pizza and pasta fab also mixed grill. 5 had different meals and all great thanks.
pizza and steaks very good.  located in a nice square and lots of seats outside with heaters.  staff were friendly efficient and do not rush you.  very relaxing meal
"we ate here during the tt festival so it was absolutely packed! they had a special menu for the few nights that the festival was on for. i had the spaghetti carbonara and the portion was absolutely huge, i barely made a dent in it. it was very tasty however. my husband had the pizza which looked good too. the service was good despite how busy they were and we are looking forward to eating here again on a normal evening."
nice and cozy place. excellent food with quality ingredients. will make this my favorite italian place in assen!
i live in assen and i love going there. everytime i suggest isolabella. its great to sit outside and also possible almost the whole year because of their warmingsystem. not only the food and the prices are good but also the service is wonderful!
"i had to get the barstaff in the bar to translate the menu for me and was astounded to find around 100 pizzas offered! i opted to talk to the staff to arrive at a favourite and they were helpful, polite and good humoured. good service and a good pizza. well done!"
lovely atmosphere - real buzz and very good italian food.  always go there when we visit my daughter and family in assen.  lovely staff too.
"a very popular and busy pizzaria in assen, large selection and very good quality. service is good, and prices very reasonable. can be busy so check the availability of tables"
"nice place and very friendly people, good service and good food . there english is good so no problem , that help a lot. we were there with some friends and it was a great evening."
love the dutch cheeses flavoring great italian foods.  the lasagna was fabulous! the pizzas looked good too.
"nice coffee, nice pastries & lunches. good service & very good location. definitely would drop back in here again when in the area."
"excellent coffee choices, very friendly service, good light lunch options. assen is a small town with lots of shops, easy stop when you are cycling drenthe. interesting museum, very worthwile!"
"the food was amazing. finally, an authentic italian restaurant. the service was also on fleek. coming back here for sure"
"a great restaurant, excellent food. superb gluten free dishes! the owner, luca, is a great person whom you can feel that he loves his restaurant and enjoys the satisfaction of the customers. super recommended !!"
had dinner with friends / colleagues at da paolo. great location across the zoo and in a shopping mall. food was alright. not your standard pizzeria. they have more dishes including meat and fish. it was quite busy this thursday evening. the setting is great for a family dinner or when dining out with friends. service was friendly. food was ok to good. we asked for some extra peperoncino but they either forgot about it or put paprika on instead. pizza was good tasting. risotto very delicious t 
"fine place. great pasta. great starters.  pizza, calzone, pasta. but don‚Äôt expect spaghetti and meatballs. the dishes are better than that.  good wines.  great service.  you‚Äôd swear you were in a real italian restaurant.  enjoy!!"
we went there with a group of business people and ordered different starters. all were excellent and especially the pizza bread they serve in the beginning is wonderful. the pizzas and pasta afterwards were great as well.
"su sardu real italian food. very good beef, very good pasta home made.im italian and i suggest this restaurant."
"i visited this lovely restaurant with an italian colleague while in emmen on business and he was so enthusiastic about it that we returned 3 times.the pasta was freshly made and delicious and the pizza thin, crispy and equally good. i also had a very good fish dish. the owner and staff are extremely friendly."
a gem of a restaurant in central emmen. very friendly service and most delicious food - half full on a tuesday evening. grazie!
"we turned up as a party of 19 (8 adults and 11 children aged between 3-16) with no reservations after a day at the local wild life park (zoo). we were made to feel welcome by the staff and found a group of tables. service was quick, with drinks being ordered and delivered very quickl "
"i went to to eat here with my friend, and we ordered the valentines menu. the starters were great, we got a little bit of everything. the main was okay, the chicken and pasta were so-so to me. the desert was good. the red wine we had was deliciou "
"it was very late hours, restaurant was open and they ready to service. we ate italian vegetarian pizza, it was delicious (may be we were very hungry, lol)"
"there are restaurants that you know are good and you should visit more often but somehow you just dont. su sardu is one of those places. it must have been at least 5 years since i last visited this establishment, or maybe even more. back then there was another owner and i remember the food was fantastic. its not that it is a long drive, its right in the middle of the city and i must pass it at least 20 times a year, but somehow when we go out for a bite su sardu is not the first thing on our mind. perhaps its because its italian and the first thing you think about with that is pizza, but su sardu is so much more then this. we visited the place with our friends as a farewell dinner before they went off again to australia. admitting it was not our first choice, i was happy that we ended up here. although the interior is a bit to modern/cold to my taste, the service and food more then makes up for it. we chose the combinazione completa and had several starters each well prepared and very tasty. as a main i had the rack of lamb after the ( friendly and professional ) waitress ensured me that it was very good. and she was right !. the fresh pasta served with the dish was perfectly cooked and seasoned with pesto. after all this i could not resist the wonderful torta al mango as a dessert. the whole evening was as it should be, good friends, good food, good service.. it will definitely not be another 5 years before i return !"
"nice place, good food , one place to come back. centrum area of the city, just in the begining .  perfect place to walk and see a lot of shops there .."
"as su sardu has changed owner also the restaurant changed to the better, a good lunch menu and good dinner menu. nice and friendly staff, good chefs in the kitchen. when you want a great evening ask the staff not for the menu, but ask them for the specials of chef with either a wine arragement"
"while on business we ate here.  service was great and all english speakers.  the decor is moder. with large log fire, great on winters night.  big menu and well presented. flavours clean and not too heavy.  great value"
"nice waiters, extensive menu (ask for english menu), and good food with large portions. unfortunately, it was difficult to communicate with the staff, which is understandable as this is a smaller town. huge problems at payout though as we discovered that they only take maestro cards, not even visa or mastercard. this seems to be relatively normal for the area, but worth mentioning to visitors."
"on our last night in the area, and being a monday, where many of the shops and restaurants are closed, it was a relief to find a good pizzeria open. the decor is immaculate and the staff friendly and helpful - we don‚Äôt speak dutch, so it was great to get a little help from the waitres "
we had great dinner with 3 famil 
nice restaurant with good food and good service. the tables are not too close to each other so that is nice. the maincourse (salmon) i expected to be more with vegetables.  but nevertheless it was still good prepared.
"great place and highly recommended !!!!  on arrival we thought we were wrong because the location is in the heart of a residential neighborhood.  we ate the pizza of the place and it was excellent, the atmosphere amazing and the service pleasant"
"travelling in flevoland we found this restaurant. nearby parking, nice interior, comfortable seating and a cosy fire burni "
"spending time together when you have two kids becomes rare. so when the opportunity came by to have dinner together we decided to go for this romantic restaurant. the ambience is great, romantic with the fireplace. the staff is really friendly and helpful. the food was great, the meals looked great and tasted really good. if youre looking for a nice place to eat in lovely lelystad, go to sorrento!"
"arrived without reservation, however patrick the manager organised a table, while we had a nice wine at the bar. service was very good and the food even better. price was very reasonable for what we had. well worth a visit!"
"enough to choose from for your diner, including traditional dishes and more creative options. accompanied with perfect wines, especially the red wines. let them pour one into their perfect karaf, and enjoy!"
we arrived around 7.30pm on a sunday without a reservation. a party of 9 on our bikes after cycling close to 90 miles that day feeling very tired and hungry. although we were still in our cycling gear we were made to feel very welcome by nando with the fire roaring and a lovely relaxing atmosphe 
"we had, again, a great dinner last night at sorrento. the setting comfortable for families and couples. the food is great and the have very nice wines. enjoy an italian style diner at sorrentos."
"the atmosphere is nice. good italian food. me and my family have been going here for the last 15 years. we all have our favorites. great pasta, pizzas and wine. if you dont want to go out you can order in and they do deliver."
"nice italian food, in a suprisingly nice entourage. especially the pizzas are very nice. also the possibility to order in."
italian - menu good but once visited a few times you know what your favorites are! quality good and constant. wine menu go 
"we ordered the #53 (championages speciale), pepperoni en cheese and a meat pizza. we all enjoyed our pizza, delivery was a bit delayed which took an hour and 15 minutes. warning!! if you have olives in your pizzas, the stones are still inside, just be aware so you don‚Äôt damage your teeth."
"although first appearances aren‚Äôt so impressive- a long dark wooden furnished dining room-the courtyard, under a lush vine, complete with grapes, is a lovely relaxing place to eat great pizza. 100+ varieties- all on a thinnish deep-pan base. just like so many good independent pizza places from the 70s and 80s, before phut and pizza e came along. prices are a real bonus- much lower than main street places. oh, and although the desserts are great (a huge bowl of strawberries, ic and cream for ‚Ç¨3.50?!!!) it‚Äôs next door to what seems to be the most popular ice cream parlour in holland- long qs at 9.30 on a sunday evening? "
"excellent service, we tried many flavors all were excellent.  the pear, melon, pistachio, vanilla all  were good.  the shop had few seats in front of the store"
"first time in the area we googled italian restaurants/takeaway and this place scored well. attended for a takeaway and we were not disappointed with the quality and quantity of the food. the bruschetta was clearly freshly made and delicious as was the salmond spaghetti and the penne carbonara. my only disappointment, we were charged the full restaurant price for a takeaway, or it would have been a 5 star review. i‚Äôm not sure if this is common in holland, but it certainly is not back in scotland. that said, we will most definitely return there to ‚Äúsit in‚Äù during our stay. the restaurant has a very authentic italian feel to it."
many pizzas on  the menu (normal and napolitana). one minus on quality control: the pizza pepperoni was made with ham in stead of salami/pepperoni
"do not let the unassuming outside of this restaurant fool you.  inside you will find an incredibly charming restaurant.  the food and wine were great, the staff was very kind and attentive, and the bruschetta was some of the best i‚Äôve ever had."
"great options for topic on pizzas. nice venue, good location. almost every time i visited leeuwarden, this was the pizzeria to go to."
"it makes you feel like being in italy and the food is the best in town. i have not been to such a good italian in a long time.staff, music, food, wine everything just fits. i have been several times and service has been performing well every time even when busy. if i come back to the netherlands i would go to leeuwarden just for that one!"
"very attentive and friendly staff, good food and they have big portions. they also have a couple of menus in english even!"
we had a great dinner. pizza selection is very good. no disappointment at this restaurant. everyone was delighted with the service. coffee was a fine ending to a good value and great food.
"quality of pizza and ingredients were high! service was good, but had to wait a while, but i wasnt in a hurry and i had a beer to drink, so i was in no worry mode. the afternoon was warm, so the dining room was also a bit on the warm side. not a big deal, i would definitely go back for more!"
"we had pizza dinner in pompei leeuwarden with a bunch of students and eachers (altogether 25 pax) . student pizzas were simple but inexpensive - from menu i chose pizza with spenach, tomato and atichoke. that was really delicious - not too big, very good dough and tasty filling. i recommend."
"we had dinner at this place with a rather big group. at first glance you would say that the restaurant is rather small, but once inside, you will notice that they do have a lot a space on different floo "
"for more than 30 years we come to this restaurant! and every time again we have a great pizza. lots of choice, lots of flavours, lots of taste, every time again! so.....if you visit leeuwarden and looking for a great meal: go to pompei!!"
"my experience here was great. i came here alone. even so, i was accepted to take a seat at one of their tables. took tagliatelle with chicken and a glass of white wine. service was great, food excellent, people were friendly."
was looking for a place to grab some food and spotted this italian place. so decided to grab a pizza and glad of wine.  the combination was good. the pizza was very tasty. too bad i had to leave leeuwarden the next day .
we stopped by here one morning for a few beers and looked at the menu for dinner optio 
"pleasant spot on a square, well patronised by locals, enormous drinks menu, so if you are into gin or cocktails definitely a place to visit. some good drinkable wines at reasonable prices, and the same for the food. italian biased but other choices too, food equally enjoyable at sensible prices. tip try the cheese board plank to go with drinks. note this restaurant only accepts credit cards in payment!!"
i recently visited the fellini city lounge with a large group of friends ( 36) the staff catered well with the large number of customers. the food was delicious and well presented. the drinks menu was also good. all 36 left having enjoyed good food and an enjoyable experience.
simple menu but super tasty food. service very friendly and quick. good relaxed vibe for a city centre lunch.
"nice service, could speak perfect english and had english menus as well. ordered tea which had a wide variety of flavours and the club sandwich which was huge and the ingredients tasted lovely and fresh. would go there again for sure"
went here with a large group of people. still they managed to give us a nice choice of food and service. have an allergy? no problem! even tho its not originally in the set menu they still managed to help out and create a stunning replacement.
this is a very good italian restaurant. the staff were helpful efficient and friendly. the menus was good and the food was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend a visit.
nice atmosphere familie feeling in combination with good food and normalprices close by museum and parking
been here with friends in a raining day of summer. we sit outside anyway and we have great time. the food was really good and the service good also. i will come back for sure.
after visiting the fries museum we went here for an early dinne 
before going to a concert we decided to have dinner close  
"this is a pleasant place with generous portions and cheerful staff. the restaurant is relatively centrally located in a town of very walkable size, and the frisian museum is just next door."
we needed a hand with some of the translation of the menu and the waiter was fabulous. he wasnt sure of a couple of the words so he came back in seconds with his i pad with google translate on it. what service. we had a superb meal too. cant fault the place at all.
"for some reason this place has a low reputation among reviews, but i think totally undeserved. the pizza is the tastiest in leeuwarden, and its a nice place to go out to eat."
very good pizzas and good service. we ordered our pizzas on the phone and they were ready on due time. the quality is very good for pizzas that are not that expensive.
"apparently these guys just won the best pizza of leeuwarden competition! well, i couldnt agree more! very cozy place, with a lot of great italian dishes on the menu"
"we wanted to order a bottle of whine and we got an excellent recommendation, so ask them about it! the pizzas had a true italian flat crust. we had an amazing dinner, partially due to the lovely waitress."
"lovely atmosphere, had to wait a tad for my food because they were baking it fresh but it was soooo worth it. ordered the lasagna with mozzarella and it was one of the best dishes ive had in my life, my friends both ordered a pizza each and both were really satisfied, would recommend without a doubt "
known mostly by the locals this italian restaurant is one of the hidden gems the city has to off 
"if you want to go for a good pizza and dont want to spend too much, this is the place to go! the pizza is a good size and often the food is ready in no time!"
"made an unplanned stop for pizza.  pizza was authentic italian, a was the wine and service. will be back"
"called in on the off chance for lunch while out visiting places nearby. beautiful place with good views, outdoor seating and a spacious indoor restaurant. friendly staff were very helpful and served food and drink from a varied menu. the quality of both the food and drinks were excellent."
"feel like having italian style pizza? de burgemeester van naples is a place to go in leeuwarden. in the past they served calzone with nutella and mascarpone, too bad that is now off their menu."
"very delicious cuisine, super friendly staff, very nice service offered. lovely atmosphere. definitely recommended!"
"due to covid-19 the restaurant was closed. but the restaurant offered the possibility to order the majority of the menu online. we ordered as appetizer taglieri delle casa and as main course pizza prosicuto and pizza salami picante. the order was delivered at almost the split second and was of high quality and good temperature. it was our first time ordening online and it won‚Äôt be our last, a good experience."
"i am in leeuwarden for work and visited for some authentic pizza and was not disappointed. i ordered the house special, pizza de burgmeester van naples. it was thin crust, napoli way, and had a great balance of meat and cheese. it‚Äôs always nice to sit outside, enjoy the breeze, and drink a peroni with good pizza."
this is getting to be the same for every place in leeuwarden that we have been to good food good beer good service.  i wish every restaurant was like it
hello we come every year to the mayor of naples and every time it is super nice food and top pizza and pasta and super nice staff and nice kitchen staff and wait staff who takes time for our son who would like a photo of the oven where he is at and quite where other companies can take an example so much patience until next year thanks for everything family johan
"came here on a bit of a whim as we were in leeuwarden for the night and both really craved pizza. its quite a large restaurant with seating inside and out. the layout and the furnishings turn what could be a large, chaotic space into something quite cozy and intimate. we both ordered pizzas and drinks, in the case of my partner a surprisingly good 5 euro negroni! the pizza was excellent, great crust, fluffy on the inside and just a little crispy on the outside. i always feel a little apprehensive ordering pizza in a restaurant because the quality can very so wildly but i reckon they pretty much nailed it. the toppings were nice and there were plenty of them, but i kind of felt like they were overshadowed by the dough and the sauce. excellent service to boot. no reservations about coming back here whatsoever."
"we had a party of six and every person loved their meal! we had pizza, calzones, lasagna, and pasta and it was all delicious. don‚Äôt pass up the gelato at the end either! our favorites were the white chocolate and lemo "
"as italian living in friesland for one year already, i often miss the taste of the real pizza that is unfortunately not so easy to find around here. but finally there it was, delicious and perfect pizza üòç the service was very nice and fast, the atmosphere is also cute. the prices of course are way higher than the italian average but don‚Äôt forget we are in the netherlands ü§ó the menu looked great and we will definitely come back some other time to try some pasta as well. we also had desserts, everything very good. can‚Äôt wait for the next visit ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"we were lucky to find a large table in the shade which allowed us to chat and people watch at the same time. the service was fabulous with attentive servers, and the food was fresh and tasty. it is in a great location and i would recommend a visit."
had a great dinner here after a long day of traveling. the pizzas are very good and big enough for a full meal. we also had some tasty wine. it was nice to look out the window at the city center and people watch here. they also have a wonderful ambiance!
we had a very nice meal at de burgemeester van naples recently. the staff were very good and the restaurant had a fantastic atmosphere. the food on offer was typical italian fare. i had a pasta and jumbo prawn dish which was delicious. the restaurant also has a very good drinks menu- the aperol spritz was just perfect. i would highly recommend a visit.
had a lovely plate with bread and homemade dips and olives before we went home for dinner. it was great and very tasty. would visit again for dinner. great atmosphere and employees were very friendly!
i had lunch here today. they served really great piadina: fresh ingredients! the service was fast and the place gives good vibes. if you are in leeuwarden i would recommend this place.
"i am quite picky with pizza.. but i have to admit that the one i had in de burgemeester van napels was one of the best i had in the netherlands. the restaurant has a wood fired pizza oven, which is not that common here. the only downside is that pizza is served only for dinner."
"the pizzeria de burgemeester van napels‚Äù, in leeuwarden has been a magnificent discovery. as italian and especially as neapolitan living in the netherlands since more than 16 years, i can say that i never have eat a better pizza! for taste and quality this has been the pizza that come more close to what i normally eat in napl "
"i have bent there twice, and it is really good. as we heard, this was newly opened in leeuwarden (in that time), it is nicely decorated and a big restaurant in italian style. they mostly serve pizza, and some pasta. pizza is really, but like really good. although not so big, but that can be decieving. i thought at first, oh my good, this is so small, but at the end (with two beers :)) it was quite enough for a dinner. staff is great, only downside is that they have a small menu, but at the end maybe they wouldnt have that kind of quality in food."
"the restaurant serves a variety of italian food, but we went simply for the pizza. the toppings offered are creative, we enjoyed our pizzas, although we did find them quite salty."
very good friendly people..excelent food very tasty! i loved also the wineof the house and desserts.
"we had dinner here with our friends, who had recommanded this restaurant. we had baguette with 3 different toppings as an entree and they were nice. the main meal was excellent. we had the beef fillet and it was very tasty and very tender. our friends had the osso buco and that was very good as well. we shared a tiramisu and that was okay. we were seated outside as weather was beautiful and it was very pleasant. the service was very friendly. "
its a good place where to find very good italian food in friesland. the owner give attention to the quality of the food and he has a lot of wine choice. if you like grappa as well he as a huge list of wonderful one
"best pizza in friesland, delicious meat dishes, super variety of pasta dishes, great selection of wines, lovely smiles!! we go once a month!"
good italian restaurant cooked by genuine italian people from corsi 
"we went by a recommendation at tripadvisor, the service was great, the portions were big and very tasty. we had a selection of pizzas and pasta and everything was wonderful"
"we had pizza at il nuraghe an it was delicius. i counted 67 different pizzas an a lot of other nice food. if you look for a good menu for a good price, this is the place to go."
the italian serra family knows how to bake a pizz 
"came here to study & could stay all day up into the late evening, which is great because coming from the us everything else in this city closes at 5 pm! prices are the slightest bit high but everything tastes so good and fresh!"
"are you a tourist visiting t loo palace or are you in apeldoorn for another reason, book a table at klein berlijn. you will not regret it! this little gem is a type of kitchen, healthy, personal, great design interior, very tasty and beautifully shaped dishes, absolutely great cook, that would be fully booked every evening, should it be situated in a town like amsterdam, rotterdam or utrecht. but it is not, so one of the two floors was full on the friday evening that we were there. good for us, not good for the restaurant. i think that arno (i dont know him, only know his name from the waiter), deserves all the support he can get, because of his courage to open up a restaurant like this in the, food wise, conservative town of apeldoorn. we had a light dinner with a great salmon sashimi, a very tasty paella and a great fish of the day. all colorful dishes, very tasty, with good ingredients. even the coffee was very good. we will be back. hopefully we will meet you there :). no remarks at all? well, yeah, one. time between dishes was too long. should be about a quarter of an hour less. make sure you have enough to discuss ;)"
"i am from hague, hut i love to come and chill down here. its such an cool place and veey hipster and berlini looking, also they have lots of vegan diahes and the atmosphere is just cozy and cool and go with the flow. very nice that sich places excists actually in apeldoorn!"
"biological restaurant. a lot of place and several floors. the upper floor is more cozy. the food was good. the first course was special, the second more ordinary and the last course (browny) was not very special. friendly service."
this restaurant has a lot to offer. the building is very interesting. the decoration is very interesting as well. look at the pictures and judge for yourself. very friendly staff. we liked the lunch food (warm sandwiches) and tea/coffee we had. we would come back and order the same thing. that is a good sign. minor points: the mens bathroom could use some tlc and it is positive that the neighborhood is still in development.
a really nice evening with excellent service from staff ! pasta choices were delicious and a lot üòÄ combination with offered wine- great way to go !
"we have tried the lasagna, the so called italian burger with fries coated with parmesan and spaghetti carbonara. everything was very good, good portions. sat outside at the small tables right on the sidewalk- quite nic "
"had the pleasure of hosting a group dinner for twelve. during phone calls to make and confirm the reservation, the older lady on the other end of the phone was rude, abrupt and threatened that if we did not show up exactly on time, we would lose our reservation. nothing like a good threat to start the night out righ "
"we loved it!  wonderfull staff and a very tasty food in a good price, thank you :) we ate soup and pizza and we loved it it is also very clean."
an excellent place with an italian atmosphere.   true italian place the pizza and the pasta were delicious!!   thank you
best pizzas in town. run by a nice italian women who makes you feel welcome every time. the pizza choices are endless. and they taste delicious. it never takes more than 20 minutes for your pizza to arrive. i highly recommend this cosy pizzeria.
and the personnel is very nice!/ service is great - they do their best to let you feel at home. the food is of good quality for a reasonable price.
"very tasty and well made pizza in apeldoorn. the menu is extremely diverse to the point its difficult to choose something so im sure theres something available for any taste no matter how demanding. friendly staff, nice atmosphere and fast service. one thing to take into consideration though - they do not accept credit cards so if youre from overseas cash is your only payment option."
"obviously a very popular local restaurant as we couldnt get in on saturday so went again on sunday night. i had an excellent mixed seafood pizza (salmon, prawn, artichoke hearts etc) definitely 5* although my husbands was more average but acceptable. very short wine list - chianti or lambrusco- so we went for a carafe of house rose which was just fine"
"we visit this pizzeria several times a year, and always enjoy our meals her "
the pizza was amazing. service excellent and hosts friendly.
i went here for pizza and the quality of the pizza was very good. expect to pay around 10 euros for a pizza. service is friendly and efficient. the restaurant itself is a bit small and they put quite a lof of tables inside.. so when its full it might feel a bit overcrowded. would definatly go back here again for pizza one day.
"da vinci is my go-to restaurant when i am in this city! amazing food, attentive waiters, welcoming atmosphere, and the cutest set up! you really feel cared for in this place, which is unusual for dutch restaurants/ hospitality (üôÑ). the menu is amazing and they pay attention to any changes or addition you would like to your food! 100% coming back! they have a loyal customer now."
"we had no reservation on this saturday but the italian owner was so nice to give us a nice table for two. we start sharing three starters vittela tonato, bresaola and cozze. we enjoy our starters very much. the food was prepared wel "
"ideal place to have a nice italian meal.we were three and we had a tagliatelle with salmon,a pizza crudo and a pizza quatro stagioni plus two primi pasti shared with a bottle of excellent white vermintino wine,all for the price of 99 euro.we were served by two very friendly ladies who seemed to love their jobs.a place to come back to."
"i visited this place and had a delicious pizza. italian style pizza, not americ "
"we just wanted to find a place for dinner, and we were surprised by the quality. it was good food, and the wine recommended really went well with the meal. a surprise find."
we had a big family group and the food was very good and the staff very nice. the dining area has enough cozy spots for couple dinning. keep in mind they have large portions.
"this small, narrow but very cozy italian place is near apeldoorn city center. the maestro comes from cagliari sardegna and prefers to speak only italian. as greeks and italians are una faccia, una raccia we had zero communicational problems. we had the typical italian first dishes (bruschetti/pomodorro, ruccola/parmiggiana) and as main dish we all got linguini ai fungi. everything was excellent. only the beer was dutch. we ordered and had a bit of everything from desserts (do try it, at least for once in a month you can do it). then came the maestro with his grapa di casa and that finished us once and for good that evening."
"took a group of 6 here for dinner. the place is very nice inside and the staff was accommodating by putting a few tables together. most tables inside are 4 or 2 people. we were lucky because it was not that busy so they could move things around. food was good and service was good...a bit slow by u.s. standards but you need to remember where you are. bottom line is a good place to eat, with very nice staff."
". cosy, intimate thing. very nice and courteous service, all at times seemed a bit too much for the boy guests only. the food was great! and that is pretty if you like meat, fish and vega ordered at one table (i speak from many bad experiences elsewhere). everything is delicious to taste and a little spicy, which even my great aunt could really appreciate. the pre mushrooms are for me a real winner! the tomato sauces at the mains were freshly prepared and you can taste it. try to decorate at least for 1 main course spaghetti with garlic and chillies i would eat it every day with love! the wine drinkers at the table (red, white and rose) were very satisfied, tasty good wine. the desert map i noticed something on, until our shared dessert arrived with everything. go for the tartufo or limoncelloijs;) deliciou "
"da vinci is one of the best italian restauraurants we know. been there in october with friends and had a great time. very nice menus with plate service, but we just asked to make something special. it was! thats for sure, we will back very soon."
"ive visited this italian restaurant several times because its probably the best pizzeria in town. ive also tried some of their other dishes, which were less impressive, so if you like pizza: go for  "
"the staff was really nice and the pizza was amazing! thin fluffy bottom, crispy edges, fresh sauce, not too salty or greasy. they also had some really good cocktails."
i ordered a pizza parma speciale. i think its the most delicious pizza ive ever eat 
"i am very much impressed with the food pibia serves! it is quite a large restaurant with a big menu to choose from, but everytime i went, everything i chose came out great. even the lasagne, which is usually disappointing in restaurants, was great! the service is also great, and the (house)wine is also good. if you want to eat italian food in apeldoorn i recommend you to go to pibia."
we met some nice people in apeldoorn at a bar and later we diced to have dinner togeth 
"friendly staff good pizzas, if we come back in apeldoorn we definitely will eat a pizza there. if you dont like big places with lots of people you shouldnt go there"
"when i say every time, i really mean every time. weve been here dozens of times and it always is the best pizza in town. they have sooo many pizzas to chose from, but they also serve other dishes. keep up the good work, and we will keep coming ba "
had a great night out with family enjoying well cooked pizza with quite acceptable glasses of house red wine. if you are chasing italian cuisine then a visit will not disappoint
ate here with a large group. the menu is large (70+ pizzas) but very interesting. the pizza came quickly and the service was reasonabl 
"found this to be much better than the other pizza place in town, sardegna. one minor annoyance, the staff are not terribly attentive, perhaps theyre overworked, but otherwise a good experience."
"after spending summer holidays in italy, the pizzas at pibia do not disappoint. they are absolutely deliciou "
very good quality for money. nice atmosphere. enough places where you can zit.  a lot of pizzas and pastas and all very delicious.
"this restaurant is excellent, the food is delicious- great pizza and pasta, the tiramisu desert is wonderful and the prices are fare for everyone. the service is also good. i recommend to visit in your next visit in the area"
"we are regular customers of this italian restaurant. we enjoy the pizza, pasta and 3-course menu very much."
"the most fantastic steak apeldoorn has to offer. even in corona times enzo, viera and their team provide the best food there is. thank you for making us feel at home when we have to stay at home!"
we went there few times during the week because of some events.  it was each time late (around 22h30 or even later). we were wamly welcome each time.   food are good and well served. i would recommend this place.
"waiters were very nice and accommodating. we were helped by at least three of the restaurants staff. the restaurant has a small dinning room and is very cozy. the food is good, nothing exceptional but you leave with a good feeling of great hospitality."
"the food is great, pizza and pasta. the bread with garlic butter is lovely and big portions, its well priced and in a prime spot. what can anyone complain abo "
good choice of pizza and the pizzas my son and i had were definitely above average. the restaurant has a good ambiance.
"we had excelent time, good real italian food .  the food was delicious, hot and arrived on time service courteous and friendly.  strongly recommend."
this italian is in the small centre of apeldoorn . good selection of pizza and pasta . family run not a chain . fair pricing ideal for relaxed family or friends meal . house wines not on the menu - you need to ask . would use again . no outdoor seating .
this was a delight. the food was very good (i had linguine vongole). the service was just right too.  the cost was reasonable too. recommended.
"this restaurant offers a cozy atmosphere and good pizzas and pastas. it is not super chic, rather unpretentious, suitable for families or friends. service is friendly and attentive. the decoration and music give you the ‚Äúitaly vibe‚Äù. prices are decent. location by the river is nice, we plan to come back sometime during summer when outside seating is possible. all in all, recommended."
a very nice place for bigger groups we had a dinner more 15 of us. service was very good and fast and the food was very good as well.
"my boyfriend and i had ordered pizza from here a few times and decided to actually go for our anniversary, and i cannot stress how much we enjoyed it here. the service was impeccable, the food was authentic and delicious, and the ambience was great. we went on a monday so it was naturally quiet, and you could tell the place is family run. everywhere was warm and cosy, the stone pizza oven within view. we were treated amazingly- coats taken off and hung at the door, complimentary bruschetta and bread, asked multiple times whether we needed anything else etc. we will definitely be returning, especially in the summer as it‚Äôs situated right on the riverfront. highly recommend!"
"part of seven visited early on the evning without a reservation but were soon seated together.excellent pizzas , i had the 4 seasons and was probably the best pizza outside of italy that i have had. whats more you could watch the chef at work by the pizza oven. good prices friendly staff and with a few more people in i think there would be a great ambience."
"we visited this restaurant for a family dinner. i am italian and i am always a bit skeptical to go in italian restaurant abroad. however this restaurant was a pleasant surprise. from what i understood it is managed from a sicilian family and you can taste it. the food is very good and the quality is high. we took 3 bruschettoni with stracciatella cheese, rucola and cherrytomato and one parmigiana as starters. the cheese was definitely real stracciatella, probably imported from italy and the parmigiana (eggplants dish) was extremely tasty. as main dish than we ordered one plate of spaghetti vongole e ricci di mare, 4 branzini in crosta di pistacchio e 1 pizza 4 formaggi and 1 pizza alla norma (with eggplants and ricotta cheese). the pasta was good as well as the fish. the pizzas very extremely good especially the norma one. the sauce was clearly home made and tasty. the decorations in the restaurants recalled a lot sicily , you can clearly see that behind it there is quite a care for details. music is also italian, mainly classic songs. the service is good, the waiters speak good english too and finally was a nice evening. i felt for an evening to be in a real italian restaurant. the price was a bit higher in my opinion, considering the amount of food, but in general we had a great time. if you like real italian food i highly recommend you this place. "
the ristorante delletna was a very pleasant surprise. the food is delicious and the staff very helpful.   they dont have the typical dishes that you would expect in a regular italian restaurant. this is a sicilian restaurant.
we sat in the sunshine next to the river intending to have a few beers only after a walk to the john frost brid 
the best italian restaurant overseas where to find traditional and refined cuisine in a comfortable typical sicilian ambient. very clean and worm. need to go back again. congrats
"best italian food that i ever tried in the netherlands. excellent service, delicious dishes, all superb. we reserved via the fork and got 20% discount but worthy to go without discount. authentic italian food. they gave us poise cafe from the house. we will go again for sure."
"totally disagree with the 2 negative reviews here. its a great place, with wonderful food and welcoming atmosphere and staff! the food is authentic and very tasty. cant fault it at all! the only thing is that the food is so nice that you could keep eating it! its reasonably priced too. yes, were definitely fans and hope to return very soon!"
a superb revisitation of classic sicilian dishes in a contemporary esthetic. penne al pistacchio di bronte and the calf cheek are highly recommended!
stumbled across this gem while heading to the rhine wwii bridge in arnhem. we were the only folks there for a late lunch and the owner lit the stove and cooked an amazing salmon dish for me and a fabulous filet of beef for my husband. wonderful wine and great atmosphere. the owners are italians and the food was 100% as good as anything we have eaten in italy. highly recommend!
one of the best sandwiches i ever had! cosy authentic relaxed atmosphere. italian size coffee sandwich bar. superbe coffee and helpful friendly staff. must go place
"been a few times. the pizza‚Äôs are not your average pizza‚Äôs, but better. friendly staff. the pizzeria is located in a boulder gym, which is a good combination. work off those calories before eating. only point of criticism is speed; it takes a longer than the usual time before the order gets there. it‚Äôs usually a busy place and they seem somewhat ill-prepared. "
suburban chef is a small local restaurant. mostly visited by locals however everyone will be welcomed with a warm smile. the food is good and fresh. their menu varies every week however they do also sell their suburban burger(s) which are available throughout the year. check their facebook website for the most up to date menu and week specials. don‚Äôt forget to take a side order of their fresh made french frie

"i had very little time between purchase of ticket and boarding a train. much in need of coffee, i was confronted with three choices (in this immaculately clean transportation center). a train company information person said, ‚Äújulia‚Äôs - the best koffie!‚Äù she did not steer me wrong - illy brand. the solo college student staffer also quickly made me a focaccia with ham, provolone, greens, and a dark brown mustardy paste, which i had a few minutes to eat without rushing. and i caught my train on time to boot! heel goede!"

"went here 5 years ago, and had an excellent meal. i mentioned this place to my colleagues and we finally had an opportunity to revisit. it was as good as my last visit. the food is excellent, and the service very friendly. this is not a typical italian, you wont find your spag-bol here. the place was as busy as i remembered it from last time, and it is best to reserve your seati "
risotto with wild cath prawn is a must try dish if you like risotto. la rusticana has nailed this dish. the lady and guy who serve us were offered top class servise. highly recommended.
"they don‚Äôt have much negative review, that‚Äôs is why i choose this restaurant for the night. after we dine in twice, dinner and next day lunch, understood why. staffs and owner was very friendly and with great knowledge of their menu and wine list, the foods were pretty amazing, very fresh and tasty, great wine to start with. we had these antipasto degustazione & saffron risotto with wild prawn tails as starter, fish of the day & linguine all‚Äôastice as main, highly recommend you to try. well, we pretty sure other of the dishes will be very nice too. we had dinner with a 22 months baby, he was tired and little out of control last night because of jet lag. owner gave me a very comfortable response and offer to help. couldn‚Äôt thanks enough to the man and lady who served us last night we had a pretty great dining experience here. the come back risotto definitely bring us back for the next day before we leave arnhem. if we come back to this place again, will definitely dine in here!"
had dinner here with friends and this is italien food as it was intended.  on the table we had fish and meat and all were prepared well and tasty.  even the staff is authentic ;-)

authentic italian food paired with great italian wines served in a big town house. well known for their variations of carpaccio. extensive wine list. enjoy your meal at the fire place in winter time or in the walled in garden on a hot summer day. ask them to show you their wine cellar. the service is excellent.
never been here before although this restaurant exists for many years. the building is nice with different rooms to dine and wine. romantic. good waitresses and very nice. food is high quality against good price. recommend everyone who like good italian food. i will go more often here..!!
"one of our favorites in arnhem. always delicious italian food, high quality wines from italy and very pleasant service for a good price/quality rate."
"excellent italian restaurant, great food preparation, on some dishes the doses might vary from time to time, but apart from that, great quality matching the price."
amasing food in very beautiful surrounding. we ated at beautiful garden. this is definitelly place to visit if you are in arnhem.
"as a true italy lover is this the place to be in arnhem for a real and pure italian experience, italian family runned restaurant in the heart of arnhem with the strange italian customer firendly attitude serves the best italian food ever. traditional italian interior just make you fell as in italy"
"restaurant with a long tradition in centre of arnhem. it has a secluded city garden, probably the best in arnhem. ideal for outside dining. certainly worthwhile going there."
"i had dinner here with my family, we are italian and we struggle to find a restaurant that makes food as it was in italy and not adapted to local taste "
"the very best italian restaurant in town! in summer you can sit on their wonderful terrace. on a sunny evening you feel as if you are in italy . it is full with plants, a real green atmosphere . the food is excellent!"
i love the food here every time and the staff is very friendly and good at what they do and know! i would especialy recommend dining in the enclosed gardens in the summer; and having the bread (focus) appetizer (always)!
"the restaurant is inside an old house with different types of old rooms. rustic is the good adjective; not modern not old, just rustic (some places needed some maintenance, like the toilets in some walls). but ok, you go to a restaurant to eat. and the food was super good! nice and simple tastes and good portions (not pretentious petite french cuisine). on the expensive side, but the food was really good. worth a visit or two! "
"this restaurant has formal and informal dining rooms and serves some of the best italian food in the area. we always had a great food so we dont understand some of the complains about the quality varying. the restaurant still exists after decades, which tells much about the quality."
set in the main part of arnhem close to the shops. warmly welcoming staff who were attentive throughout. a good and varied menu with some specials of the day as well. i started with a great selection of antipasti and then had guinea fowl as the main course. there was a good selection of desserts but i was only able to fit a sorbet after the first two courses. all the food was very tasty and nicely served. altogether it was a step up from an ordinary italian restaurant.
"fabulous and very attentive staff. we were a group of 12 that did not have reservations, but walked in off the street. even though the restaurant was very busy, they put together a large table for us in minutes and away we we "
nice italian restaurant in arnhem. i visited other restaurants in arnhem during some years and im glad to finally have found one that suits me. the vitello tonato was correct but could have used some more capers. the steak of the house was perfect and so was the pannacota. the barbera dalba was quiet pricey.
on the 24th of april we have visited this italian restaurant. the tomato soup was fantastic. the lobster with pasta was almost unbelievable. what a super dinner we had.
"i have been here twice, and its a great place to be, also in the garden it is great and a real italian atmosphere. food and drinks are excellent. service very good"
"la rusticana in the centre of arnhem is a very good, real italian restaurant. they offer a large variety of dishes on the regular menu. in addition they offer several daily special dishess. they have a wide choice of nice wines (per glass or bottle).dishes and wines are good value for money.the vitello tonato is perfect, the osso buco with risotto very tasty and the gambas with spagetti aioli is also great. the degustazione di formaggi ( cheese dessert) is more than excelle "
one for the romantic couples and the ladies night out. wonderful selection of wines from several nations; dishes you expect in a global city not a regional location. service outstanding and priced to view as a special night out. rosemary bread good enough to make the choice on itself.
la rusticana is a solid name in arnhem. quality food and for the summer also a nice garden to dine. the restaurant is a good place for a family dinner but equally for a romantic setting or business meet.
"during the wine / food walk arnhem (la rusticana 2nd restaurant visited and sat in the beautiful courtyard. first a glass of vermentino (a slightly dry and spicy white wine) was given and when the waiter noticed that i wanted to take notes, he let the bottle even on the table. considerate! addition, we received a cannelloni of shellfish (shrimp, crab and lobster), which was full of flavor. a nice combination and the card makes you curious for more."
"amazing. a little bit expansive, but the quality of the food is really good and can compensate.the wine is one of the most lekker thing that they have. everything come from the count "
"we regard ourselves as true italian food lovers, having been places. this restaurant is among the best italian food weve had in holland so far."
"ate with a business colleague. good service, fromfriendly and attentive staff. not the cheapest menu but great italian food, and selection of wines. worth a visiy"
"my sister and i went here when we were craving pizza, and we were not disappointed! the pizzas looked huge when they came out, but the bases are super thin, so they arent bloating or difficult to get through. service was friendly, and the atmosphere was nice. we will return if we are ever in arnhem again."
"we have visited this place twice and both times had dinner with great satisfaction. the ambient is nice. it reflects wittiness, coziness and a mixture of suburban and hip - thats completely my personal opinion. its a kind of balance i like. the pizzas are super yummy. a small drawback is that i think they are a bit short in capacity. otherwise, its really nice food in reasonable price and cozy environment."
"stayed in arnhem for 2 nights, and both nights we ate here! both nights i had carbonara and chips with a drink. only cost around 12 euros, so was really great. the food was clearly freshly made, piping hot and full of flavou "
we had two superb meals here. some of our friends had a meal and told the the rest of our group to try it out. suffice it to say that on our last night in arnhem we chose here and a party of 13 was served with no problems at a 
i had the funghi pizza and my boyfriend has the trio de carne in the american crust. the crust and toppings were absolutely fresh and tasty! however drinks service is slow! nice restaurant and nice atmosphere also cheap and reasonable.
"having a meal with a party of eight at donatellos in arnhem was a great experience. friendly warm staff, a cosy atmosphere and very reasonable prices for decent food and drinks gave as well my guests as myself in the role of host a pleasant time."
always eat here one night when in arnhem. food always good and a very pleasant atmosphere.staff really friendly and helpful nothing is to much trouble. portions are good size and i always enjoy the pasta. pizzas are really good.get a take away box if u cant eat it all.
"donatellos serves great italian food for a bargain. the texmex pan pizza is awesome! the restaurant is always packed, so you need a reservation (even on mondays). the restaurant has too many tables in it, each table has just a little space and thats why i give it 4 stars instead of 5."
"donatellos does not have the most fantastic decor but the menu is good, the food is freshly prepared and the staff are attentive and friendly. the menu is well priced, ideal if you want to have a quick, tasty and value for money meal."
simple but good food in this cheap and cheerful italian joint - recommended. have been there on a few occasions and no complaints at all.
"we were very hungry and decided to grab a bite at cosi! and we hit the jackpot, great food with even better flavours nice surroundings and really nice staff. what do you need more when youre hungry!"
"i have been to this restaurant multiple times and every time it is a pleasure to be there. the atmosphere is great, cosy and the food is fine and not expensive. great to got to to catch up with friends."
"we sat on the terrace outside, where passing people cycles and cars always give entertainment. then came the pizza, which was actually very good. if the mood will be pizza again, we will not look any further"
great simple and delicious food is what you get at cosi. the staff is always friendly. they have a small menu and a monthly menu next to this. this restaurant is very populair so if you want yo be sure of a spot you should make a reservation.
"the food is honest and so is the staff giving the place a very easygoing atmosphere. surprise menu is fun. setback is the 2 shifts, if you are in at 18:00 you need to be out at 20:00. so take the late dinner if that disturbs you. other setback is that it is very crowded, two tables less would give it some space. avoid the table at the door!"
"we visited the cosi in arnhem for an evening dinner on a beautiful hot september evening. it was the first time we were there. the terrace was packed but luckily one table with two chairs was free. the service is very adequate. we ordered an italian water and beer. all food and drinks have a clear italian signature. they have a nice set of starters and primos. as usual in the netherlands secundos are not so common. also a rich variety of pizzas. the food is perfectly prepared; you feel yourself almost in italy. try also the daily specials: our spaghetti was delicious. prices are reasonable. main primos are about eur 12,50. strongly to recommend."
cute italian place with good food. the food isnt too pricy and the pizza is definitely one of the best in arnhem. theres nothing pretentious about this place; together with pleasant staff makes a nice atmosphere.
"we were looking for a good restaurant with good food but nothing too posh or pricy. cosi is ideal food is delicious and the portions are perfect, quality is excellent and the service is very friendly and it really make you feel cosy and make you feel that you are in a familiar place. i had the week menu option and my husband had the pizza both delicious. we shared a mixed antipasti plate and we were not disappointed. great option for a relax dinner."
"there are plenty of restaurants in arnhem where you can get a decent pizza, but if you want to enjoy an amazing pizza, you should go to cosi. us locals know that too, so make sure you get there on time (or make a reservation). the pastas are also great, whilst service is excellent."
"the best pizzas in town, what? in the country i dare say!  it is a small place with lovely owners and staff..clean, comfy, and the food ; to die for‚ù§"
"have a great pizza from the woodoven or enjoy some very nice anti-pasta and pasta dish.   small restaurant but the atmosphere is super, and when theres sun be sure to have a drink on the terrace."
"cos√≠ is the best pizzeria in arnhem, hands down. the atmosphere is amazing and the simplicity of their dishes are fitting with a true italian pizzeria. the staff is very friendly and if you are in doubt, theyll help you choose the best dish. overall a very nice gastronomic experience, definately a must when in arnhem."
"the restaurant is delicious but it gets full so be early or reserve. the service was perfect, and the pastas were fresh make and full of italian flavor. for a better experience i recommend sharing ;)"
"weve been here a couple of times now and always enjoy the food and the wines. if you like italian food youve come to the right place. in the middle of arnhem centre just one street away from the too crowded mainstreet, in the cosey 9 streets. lot of great shops around worthwile visiting the area. weve been sitting outside two times now and that was really nice friendly staff and service. we had mixed starters and some bottles of cold pino griccio. we choose from the very attractive menu the following: vitello tonato, carpaccio with truffle, bruschetta, oysters, tagliatelli truffle, tagliatelli nero and for desert sgroppino and tiramisu. a feast for the eye and really tastefull. we will be ba "
"great food, lovely people, super ambiente ... and best italian wines. love the place.. a must visit when you are doin arnhe "
"is it a wine bar? is it a restaurant? no, it is zafvino. last night, we had delicious antipasti with a dozen of red wines by the glass to choose from. afterwards a nice pasta dish and some dolci. a place to return to!"
excellent place for relaxing with wine and italian snacks. kind staff. outside area is very nice. less tourists than korenmarket. not overpriced.
"good glass of wine with tasty snack or meal. opens only late in the afternoon, usually very crowded. located amidst small shops."
"im coming here for some years already, in the beginning i was not satisfied with the price/quality. i saw that changing over the years. the quality definitely got better. in my opinion one of the nicest and coziest spots in arnhem."
feels like a holiday! try their zaff plank with lots and lots off yummie gooien the best..best..wines and a great atmosphere
fantastic italian food and great wines in a lovely restaurant. friendly staff.  be aware that tables are shared with others so you may have little privacy. we had the best artichoke we ever had and the rest of the food was lovely as well
at one of the nicest places in the city centre of arnhem you find zafvino. a cosy restaurant for one who loves to have a good wine to go with a great pasta or salad. not to expensive. nice staff.
"this is a great place to hang with your family, friends or partner and enjoy a good glass of wine and italian (comfort) food. they also have some less typical italian dishes on the menu for those who want something else. the wines are abundant and all equally great and when it comes to the food nothing less. but i have to admit weve not been coming back for the great italian food but in fact for the delicious tortillas. hopefully they never take these of the menu as ive never had them anywhere quite like here! regarding the ambience, lovely place to site outside on the terrace or inside at the cozy bar. "
perfect bar to visit in the weekend aftet a day of shopping with great and affordable food and wines. have been here for 3-4 times in the past months and have never been disappointe 
"if you want a local (arnhem locals that is) pub then this is great. busy, noisy and pretty sums up the clientele. fab wine, fab waiters / waitresses, delete as applicable, full of locals. not a guinness or a carling in sight."
"we happened by this restaurant and it looked interesting, the staff was friendly and we decided to eat here. good choice on our part. the decor is interesting (in a good way), the menus are on the chalkboards, and everyone seemed happy to be ther "
the service and atmosphere is great. good food and great wines and other drin 
"came in to drink some wine with a friend and had 2 really good bottles of wine which were recommended to us by the friendly waitress. her selections were spot on, and i am looking forward to returning."
"great place to be. great staff, great food and good wine! its not possible to make a reservation so be there in time! go go go...."
"living in nijmegen i know what its like to be deprived of decent pubs and wine bars. so bumping into this place after some saturday shopping was a great treat. this bar is minuscule and some facilities are so tiny that often you find yourself breathing in to squeeze through places, specially the toilet. but its precisely its size what makes the bar so cosy. tables are very close to each other so the bar lends itself to casual chatter with fellow drinkers. wide range of wines with incredibly friendly staff to help you choose a beverage to your taste. its do refreshing to see that in the netherlands someone still chooses style over functionality. the result is amazing."
"very cosy and friendly place with great food and wine. high quality ready-made food. tables for 4 and more. if you are with two you just join an other table and meet new people, very nice experience."
"we were a little perturbed by the exterior, and first impression of the interior of this restaurant. but we need not of worried we had an excellent dinne "
decent little italian place in the korenmarkt area. lots of outside seating (it was a nice evening). we had a nice lasagna and enjoyed it. no regrets.
"i love the pizzas here! thin, crunchy bottom and made in a real pizza oven! you can even see them make it if you want. great for kids as well. friendly staff and good service :)!"
"in a 5-night stay, we chose pinoccios twice because it was so damned good. the staff are attentive, efficient and very pleasant. both nights i had a pizza and each was first-rate... thin crust, yes, and a great range of fillings. i also tried the fried mussels as a starter. my wife had a pasta which was also excellent. the garlic mayo dip that is served with bread as a complimentary starter is to die for. we chose to dine indoors and the atmosphere is great! an old-fashioned long dinner candle on every table and little other lighting creates a mood and the ceiling is made from the tightly woven raffia chianti bottle wraps - thousands of them. seek pinoccio out - i doubt you will be disappointed."
"ate there 2 days in a row with 18 colleagues and were really satisfied with pinoccio. first night i had a steak with a peppersauce i unfortunately didnt like, but the day after i had the large meat plate and i couldnt finish it even though it was really great."
"i and my brothersh and dutch friends have eaten here for many(2010) years or more and always a great warm receptiona and great food, servive is good"
"i come here every now and then and always order a pizza. the pizzas arent the best, but they are good and the price is great. the atmosphere is cozy and the staff is friendly."
"i had a meal here and it was excellent i really enjoyed it, i would recommend this place to everybody, it was such a delight and the staff were so nice plus they had a english menu."
been multiple time and the best place in arnhem!!  the bread and aioli is unbelievable - my tip is always get a second portion.   service is fantastic - cannot rate it highly enough!
"four of us had a different pizza each to try. all were delicious, freshly cooked on the wood-fired oven.  would recommend to anyone.  we had two meals there while in arnhem. pizza was the best!"
my first dinner in arnhem was here.  it was awesome.  we were a party of about 30 people.  the set up a special section in the restaurant for us.  the service and food was great.
"had dinner here 2 nights in a row. friendly good service, nice terrac "
"enjoyed the food, the service and the ambience! would recommend as an excellent, cosy place for a meal!"
"it is worthwhile to go there to have a pizza or pasta. the prices are quite fair and the atmosphere pleasant. the staff is kind and helpful. i recommend having an onion soup as well, which is very good and combines with the italian dishes of the menu as a starter."
"best restaurant in arnhem by far. staff are polite and the food is fabulous. only downside is, is that it gets very busy and loud, and the toilets are downstairs, so not good if you have a problem with stairs."
we were hungry and wanted a lighter snack.  we decided to share a pizza.  it was great!  so was the service!
went here in august 2015 and had pizza. the pizza i had tasted really good. if i ever visit arnhem again i will come back to this restaurant and try another one.
"the restaurant is long and narrow with an entrance on the korenmarkt. the pizzas are baked in a wood oven and are excellent. the service was quick and friendly. the interior is in italian countryside style, and some 5,000 chianti bottles hang from the ceiling. we thought the prices reasonable."
"ordered a pizza and unlimited spareribs. they made sure our stay at the restaurant was good, the food was delivered fast. would recommend!"
the food was excellent and the staff were very helpful . there was a lot of ambience in the restaurant and reasonably priced.
"reasonably priced, fast and friendly service. father in law demolished the mixed grill, unfortunately he would eat anything so thats no bench mark. full of local diners which tells it own story"
visited here on our 2nd night in arnhem. it was pouring but we were warm and dry outside as they have a canopy and outdoor heati 
nice traditional italic food in the middle of the city! you forget that u are in holland..a really nice place decorate it like an italic trattoria where the staff is very friendly and the dishes are very very tasteful
"my previous review of this place was 8 months ago, as a result of liking it the i revisited last week. i found that it was as popular as ever with most tables being taken early on, i guess many others like the plac "
"good food for a very decent price! we both had a pasta(me the spaghetti bolognese, she had the pasta pesto), with two drinks each and we only had to pay 24 euro! so very good value for the food you get. the portions were big too. we only had a main dish, and were stuffed after."
had dinner there for second time in two year. this year is very very regular italian dinner. quickly served and nice staff. very family friendly decorated. will go there next year when we are back in arnhem
"i visited this restaurant 3 times over the weekend of the 70th anniversary of the arhem battle. on every occasion the restaurant was packed, showing how popular it is. i was in a party of 10 lads ordering a big order of food and drink. the drinks were delivered quickly and exactly as order "
"wow, this place was amazing, busy, and yet you could stay in here longer than expected. good atmoshere and the food was second to none. the staff were great, and a bit to easy on the eye. cannot fault this place."
"came across this little gem on the 13th september, and how greatly surprised we were. the staff was very good, and the menu was second to none. if i come to arnhem again, this will be my first port of call."
"had a thin crust pizza which was very good. my colleague had the ribs never seen such a plateful before!. exceptional staff, very quick service. crowded and noisy as to be expected with this location.wonderful people watching place from the large outside seating area. recommended for food and value."
"great deal on monday, tuesday and wednesday! pizzas have a thin crust and come straight out of a traditionalover, that you will see when you enter. its a cute place. have been coming here for years!"
lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere and reasonably priced. food was good although my pasta sauce was a little bland. the pizza was good and my husband had the ribs which he said were gorgeous. great find :)
"delicious italian recipes at this cozy, inviting restaurant. candlelight gives the atmosphere a romantic touch and provides a relaxing vibe. the service and food were equally excellent."
"a pleasant surprise located in the city center : the service was fast, very friendly and accommodating. the interior is rather dark and kitschy (including a name sake pinocchio statue) but adds a fun and quirky element to the dining experience. the pizza options were good and the delivery was quick with the pizzas delivered in good time, straight from the oven to our table. a very reliable pizzeria for future visits."
5 of us had different pizzas here and we all enjoyed them. service was good and we did not have to wait long for our food.
"set in the square we arrived on liberation day, two of our party suffer stomach issues so pizza was a good choice. service was quick and friendly and the food typical pizza, good beer, in a good location for people watching. would use again."
"restaurant is situated at the back of the cathedral and by the square where the weekly market is held. walked past several restaurants and decided to go into this one. another couple arrived just as we did, otherwise the restaurant was empty this particular lunch tim "
"we went to da guilio to have some dinner and the food and ambiance were perfect! the three-course dinner is definitely worth it, and the tiramisu is heavenly! there are fresh bread and a great wine selection. definitely worth a visit!"
"fantastic for fisch lovers sea bream in salt crust with pasta and seasonal vegetables  perfect wines , and chef"
"chef provided our party of 13 with some wonderful food, mainly salt-baked cod and duck.  three excellent courses, all [i understand] prepared by the proprietor. from carpaccio to gateau! not cheap but great cuisine."
very good restaurant. small restaurant but owner is cooking and making delicious italian dishes. i really liked open kitchen over there. i recommend this place for a lunch or dinner!!!! enjoy
i usually dont like to go to italian restaurants when im traveling outside of italy. this time we decided to go as one of the people on our groups had been there several times. owner is italian the set up is really cool with a small kitchen thats visible to everyone. its a two man show. no menu basically they make what they have fresh that day!!! the antipasti were very fresh and really good! the meat was incredible and the deserts (i had tiramisu)were even better . ive heard some comments on how pricey it is etc . i guarantee you wont find a restaurant in italy that serves the same quality food at a lower price. 
"passion, creativity and refined dishes. everything is prepared with fresh ingredients. no detail left untouched. it would not be fair to rate one specific dish as the best, because they were all go "
my gf and i visited this restaurant in march 20 
"i went to this restaurant together with a business partner for launch. we are both italian and we like our true, authentic flavours. the choice was perfect. we started with a special veal with tuna sauce...it was awesome. giulio made it with some slices of fresh tuna on top, it was tasty and nice. also the ravioli that followed were great. tasty, unique. our lunch ended with a sublime lemon cake, home made, very light...something unbelievably good. i will definitely go back the next time i am in arnhem. well done, giulio!"
"the waiter made the pasta while we waited! my duck ragout pappardelle was delicious.      my wifes carbonara was equally good, with fresh pasta and home-made sauce made from scratch.  the other meal was a plate of freshly grilled vegetables/antipasto."
"as an american, i can recall when gelato came to a city i lived in during the early 1980s. it was considered ‚Äútrendy,‚Äù and sadly did not last. to my surprise this shop has been in arnhem for numerous decades. it had wonderful flavors, homemade whipped cream, and was sparkling clean! staying with airbnb, the host took me there - ‚Äúit‚Äôs my favorite!‚Äù i have to agree. a very nice experience. mangia!"
since i was a young boy (now i am 64) we loved to visit this. icecream saloon. and now after all these years we still love their icecream since its traditional italian with immaculate taste and looks.
my friend had the carbonara and she said it was one of the best she‚Äôs ever had (& she loves her pasta!). i had the stagioni pizza. it was quite good but it was meant to have mushrooms on it but it came with onions (i would have given a 5 star rating had it not been for this). i thought perhaps i had mis-read the menu. one of the waiters was really good and knew exactly what he was doing (i did inform of if the pizza topping issue); the other waiter appeared disinterested and was not really engaging. cappuccino was the best i‚Äôve had in arnhem 
"stopped here for lunch on a cold day after a quick check of tripadvisor: we were greeted warmly and served quickly. the starter of bread and dips was fresh and tasty, as were the pizzas with extra bits and bobs added as requested. great service at a good price and happy to be given the english translation menu!"
very nice pizza!! they serve great pizza and the waiters are very nice and competent. worth a visit!
"stopped for lunch on a rainy day visiting arnhem. great toasties, beer and coffee. v friendly service. what‚Äôs not to like?"
tasty thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients. pasta dishes were also delicious - went there twice on a recent stay it was so good. they let you customize your meal and are very nice. prices are excellent especially considering tax is included and the staff was delighted by a 10% tip from this silly american.
"here you can order pasta or pizza in the way you like most, even possible to add more spices or ingredients.   a real fun to enjoy your meal, served by a young enthusiast team,very tasty food in a cosy environment.  its just a must!!!"
we came to the restaurant with a group of hungry jujitsu guys after a tournament. the staff and merel couldn‚Äôt have been more kind and helpful. i even left my hat there that they mailed to me next week. thanks merel and zappa‚Äôs!
we wanted to go for n italian diner - bumped into zappa‚Äôs n sat down. our drinks came very quick but then....it took 45 min to receive the pizza n past 
"we only ordered one course, and we both had the same thing, a salami pizza. it was good, though. really good. proper roman-style base, perfectly judged topping.  ...oh, and the service was excellent too!"
zappas is a very nice place in center of arnhem. good food and nice people! pasta is very good but remember to ask al dente :) highly recommended!
"we had two superb pizzas for a family of five. salami and spinach. they were excellent, thin and crusty. we all enjoyed it very much."
"small, busy corner restaurant with friendly enthusiastic staff.  excellent thin crisp pizza with the perfect topping ratio.  the inside decor is clean and bright with a great atmosphere.  although great value, there is no compromise on taste."
"due to the positive feedback in the reviews so far we wanted to try out zappas tonight. located in a street around the corner from the train station, we were welcomed by a very friendly waiter who hooked us up on drinks immediately. we ordered a margherita for the kids, a parma and a special cheese version for one in our family with a tomato allergy. the waiter proactively suggested some additional ingredients which were great suggestions) and the served pizzas were all excellent. overall service and food excellent, great for families but also just to stop by with your friends for a good meal before you hit the bars just down the street on the korenmarkt. we will definitely eat here again!"
"went with family with 3 kids. nice crispy pizza, good size and excellent made and friendly staff.  very good prices."
"i recently went back for dinner. first time was enough to long for a second time. and again this visit was very enjoyable. vegetarian choices enough. you can create anything here yourself to your own taste. a perfect formula. staff is attentive and know the trick how to deal with many people in a small place. fresh ingredients, fair priced! reservation required. the home (white) wine was for me a little too dry (my teeth twisted in my mouth) .. there must be better ones. i will figure out next time ;-)."
it says a lot that i returned to this place a second time while in arnhem. it is a street restaurant but lovely on a warm evening. the service was excellent and friendly. i had the carbonora which was first class. the bill was so low i thought there had been a mistake!
the pizza is very good! we had the margherita with pepperoni. so american.  the service was very friendly and had a smile. they brought us a menu in american.
"very good pizza, 5/5. made from fresh indegrients.  convienet location, 5 min on foot from arnhem station, in city centre. very good customer service."
"would totally go there again, there was a little mix up with my order but they sorted that out very quickly. food was good, though we only had pasta. drinks are very small (200ml coke seems to be the usual size) overall a great experience!"
nice place ... good atmosphere ... very good stuff ... fresh food ... live cooking ... tasty food ... pasta and pizza
"nice p!ace in downtown area closed to the train station. food is fine, good pizza, not so good the cesar salad but is a good place to eat something quick while you are shopping."
"this a interesting restaurant, you can taste different italian food, very creative, with new shapes and new tastes."
"nice, cozy place. food is freshly made and tastes great! friendly staff. great place for a quick bite or to sit a bit longer."
superb pizza and fresh pastas! been here a few times now and every time the value for money was stunning. friendly people and a nice italian style interior of the restaurant make you feel being in italy for real. and of course finish off with a great caf√© espresso (love the illy bean 
"we were seated outside on the street, and we got two thin and very tasty pizzas. very nice waiter. good value for money."
we were trying to decide among the great variety of restaurants around the square and thankfuly stopped here. the food is excellent in taste and price!
we are here on a quick visit to arnhem and were very pleased. the service was friendly and fast. we had the carbonara and the margarita pizza. both dishes were very good.
"the pasta is very good, pizza was good but i could noticed that it was reheated due to the fact that their wasnt good communication between the kitchen... so it lost a bit of its freshness and pala "
by far one of the best places to eat. not over priced and great food. loved the thin crust pizza. beer just ok..
"really good food for the price point, especially compared to the surrounding restaurants. fresh pasta and pizza for under ‚Ç¨10."
"i arrived at arnhem at lunch time and zappas is nearby the station, perfect. i notice it from the unique sign (a white bike) on my way to the centrum. it is a small, nice, warm, and pretty cafe, nice ambiance for sure. i sat at the corner, charged my phone, and got free wifi. i order spinaci pizza, it was crispy and yummy, tasted good. my friend ordered carbonara pasta, it was big portion and a bowl of french bread. we couldnt finish all so we took it away in a nice package. the cakes look nice too, im gonna be back for that next time."
"fresh ingredients, plenty of option and all at a very good price. food is prepared in view by friendly staff. not my first visit nor my last and definitely a favorite in arnhem center very convenient when you are close to station and shops. i have tried the pizza and pasta and was never disappointed."
"great italien meals, friendly staff, nice & cozy ! if you are a fan of italian cuisine, its the place to go ! small, warm fast & confortable."
"ive been a lot of times here and i really like it. the pizza are very cheap 7-11 euros and very tasty ! (good spices, vegetables..). i tried also their pastas (carbonara) and the plate was huge and good too ! moreover, they propose some salads you can compose by yourself."
"nice italian food, but watch out they dont take credit cards ......really in 21st century, and a visa didnt work either! guys, sort it out, travellers dont walk around with large amounts of cash anymore!"
"this restaurant is just a perfect place for a delicious and cheap bite. the concept is great and the service is good. it is in the middle of the center of arnhem, so easy to reach from either central station or any other place in the centre. the design is lovely. great place to go to!"
great pizzas and delicious chocomel (chocolate milk) a little small but cozy and nicely decorated good service and staff
having eaten at 6 different restaurants in our weeks visit to the netherlands this was definitely the best meal that we have had. fresh ingredients always make the difference and seeing it being prepared shows the confidence of zappas in the quality of the food. friendly service - but that is normal in holland!
"we called in to the restaurant without a booking and we were lucky they could fit us in. we both chose pizza from a very wide selection, which were delicious. the service was very friendly and there was a pleasant atmosphere. totally recommend this restaurant but suggest you book before you go."
i went here with the family last weekend when we were staying in arnhem. its a little place just on the outskirts of arnhem. the waiting staff and the cooks looked like they had just walked out of college but the food they cooked was love 
"visited with family and friends, great food to a great price! we all got pizza, all of which where tasty and crisp."
"awesome food.  just what we needed, and the service was great.  if im in arnhem again im going back. great prices."
we tried the pizza the pasta and the ice cream. all were high quality and tasty. excellence service  and good english.
"cracking pizza, good thin base and fresh toppings. really friendly and helpful staff, english speaking, well behaved dogs welcome. would not hesitate to go back."
last year we visited this restaurant twice in a week and this year we did the sam 
"medium sized menu with great meals. friendly staff and very nice, small and cosy restaurant. we had dinner in june and this was so good we decided to return the same week. this year were returning again to the warnsborn campsite close by and will definitely return to this restaurant."
although tables are available and food can be served this is actually a plce to order pizza for home delivery. the quality of the ice is italian so good
"we had a great evening on the outside terrace of what is now called trivio, food was really good so was the service. we had the mixed anti pasti for starters and the bruschettas, pizza salami, pasta vongole and as a desert the absolutely gorgeous tiramisu! at rome level if you want to compare. the pinot grigio primi soli is also a very good choice with the food. we had two bottles."
"very good service. the little one had a cheese toast, and me and the misses had a chicken sandwich which was amazing!"
we stayed at a breakfast around the corner and decided to have dinner in this restaurant. service friendly and fast. food was nice and tasteful wine top. we highly recommend this place
"we were here for my burthday, so we took the surprise menu...and it was great! everything!! one of us does not eat meat, one other no fish and no shellfish. and that was no problem, we all had great food and a great time!"
"small restaurant. the menu is kind of upscale mediterranean, and we were surprised by the excellent quality of each of the dishes we ordered. good wines too... location is some 10 min walking from the city centre, but still in a historic part of town. (late 19th century or so). not sure if they take reservations, but give it a try."
"an easy going restaurant. entrance and bar are downstairs, main part of the restaurant is on the 1st floor. nice atmosphere, good food.they serve a bottle of tap water on the side, which shows their hospitality. pleasant service. the kitchen is open, which is fine... untill they started scrubbing the floor. the noice of cleaning and the soap doesnt combine well with dining. for the rest a place to go back to."
i had a meal here with my 22yr old son and 15yr old daughter. two of us had pasta bolognese and the other had a salami pizza. servers were friendly and attentive and offered conversation easily. the pasta itself was delicious and very generous portions. my daughter assures me her pizza was amazing. we had panacotta with red berries for sessert which was so yummy. the entire bill for food and drinks for three people came to ‚Ç¨43 which is very reasonable. be aware that this restaurant only take card payments - no cash. there servers do make you aware of this before they take your order. we left the restaurant feeling like the 3 stuffes little piggies. 
although this is a chain restaurant it has a good level of choice for pizzas and other italian food. the girls had carbonara and us guys the largest pizza (meat feast i think) on the menu. all reasonably priced. there isn‚Äôt a large choice when it comes to alcohol but that‚Äôs not a problem. food is very affordable and portions were generous. a place we visit yearly when in arnhem. no need to book it‚Äôs a very large restaurant. 
we visited for the first time on my sons 10th birthday. pizza was his choice of food so we decided to give this a try. the food was delicious!!!! the menu had somthing to suite everyone with a very large selection on pizzas and pastas. i opted for a calzone and i can honestly say it was the best i have every had!i also sampled a little of what everyone els had ordered and that too was perfect. the pizzas were very big and well topped. to make it all even better the prices where amazingly affordable! we payd ‚Ç¨65 in total for 3 adults and 4 children and we all had drinks and our own pizz 
we only had a main course but the pizzas were amazing and high quality - and very reasonably priced also!
came here twice while staying in arnh 
"my girlfriend and i went on a friday evening. it was busy, but we were seated right away. we got service right away for drinks and we ordered pizza. the pizza was ready within 10 minute "
portion was also really huge on top of the affordable prices. wait staff was attentive and quick to serve us. the pasta and pizza was amazing! couldnt recommend this place more
"hearty proportions with cheap prices. cant comment about it being authentic italian cuisine or not, but for a price range from 3-10 euros, happy italy is a nice choice for a dinner with your family or friends. good service too."
i couldnt believe that you can find tasty italian food somewhere outside italy. but this restaurant proved that its possib 
"stopped here for late lunch the night before we were to leave. place looked packed but still got a table in short time. menu is mainly italian so we had the cabonara and salame e capra. was a wait for the food but the restuarant was packed so not really fussed. food arrived and it was pretty tasty. well worth a visit if you feel a bit sudo-italian. just go there, have some italian food, i am betting you wont regret it. they also do take away boxes for the pizza you just couldnt finish. prices are reasonable for this place."
good piza and pasta in good price.   beautiful place good servis. wa allso did take away and took piza home
"even though happy italy is part of a chain, they offer nice italian food for fair prices, combined with quick and good service. maybe not the place where you would bring your italian business associates, but otherwise a decent place when you are strapped for time and still want a decent meal."
this is not the best italian food i‚Äôve ever tri 
"nice ambience, friendly staff. there is 100% no cash on hand - only takes credit cards. food was very quick and good value. not gourmet but good. building design and atmosphere nice."
its a chain restaurant. very nice and a great value. large and taste portions.  i definitely recommend! do not miss.
we stopped here for lunch. amazing carbonara.. and lots of it. busy but service was very quick. we enjoyed it so much we returned the following evening for takeout pizza which was also suburb. only wish is we had one near us in england!! very reasonably priced. 
dropped in here on the off chance that we would get a table on a saturday night. seated almost immediatel 
"we were 2 families, hungry :-). the food came quickly, large & tasty. good prices as well. recommended"
"this is the essence of this review. for the price they serve (quite well), one cant get anything bigger and more substantial than here. worth the queue-up. two-three pizzas serve three hungry adults and two kids, you can take home whats left. not of the best quality but good enough. the best aspect for families with smaller kids: upstairs, theres an nice little indoor playground."
"visited this restaurant prior to seeing a movie (it is located just below the pathe movie theater in arnhem and directly next to the train and bus station). we were in and out in less than an hour. selection consists of mostly pastas and pizzas. pasta carbonara was really good. creamy well cooked pasta and great taste in the bacon and ham. the other two members of the party had the pasta bolognese which they also praised. service is fast, but once served he waitress somewhat lost track of our table, and the extra mozarella ordered at the arrival of the meals was brought when we were almost finished. price is good to the point of being really cheap. good place to have a fast meal before a movie, but not really a place for an intimate dinner as the restaurant is vast and crowded."
"i came here for a quick lunch before catching the train. astonishingly cheap (10,70‚Ç¨ for drink, salad & desert) and the food was good. good wifi to work, nice atmosphere... loved it!"
"excellent value for money  huge portion size  but not the highest quality but at this price its ok friendly staff  card payments only, no cash very fast from ordering to food on table, even when busy.. well worth a visit"
we went to happy italy in arnhem to have lunch during our holiday. it is a great place to eat with kids. fast service and good pizzas for a great price!
"whenever im out with someone and i wanna grab something yummy in a lovely place, this is where i end up most of the time. the pizzas and pastas are always amazing. the nutella pizza is soo worth ordering!!"
"nice and modern place.  pizza was really quick, even before drinks :) food is good with a lot of pizza types. recommend for dinner."
"i could not image better italian food in heart of arnhem. it was my random walk in arnhem when i discover happy italy. it was amazing big portion of food. taste like you would have pasta in italy, great wine.....mmmmmm.....amazing! i highly recommend you this place!"
"it is a huge place, with huge portions, super fast and for a very low price. and the taste was also not so bad (at least this time). since it was a surprise for us, we did enjoyed a lot. it is a kind of italian fast food... but we all enjoyed! perfect with kids, not good for a romantic dinner. just try it once..."
"variety of pizza and pasta, everything with a reasonable price tag. fresh interior. great location. recommended!"
pizza - pasta - all freshly cooked and delicious and quick a lovely surprise to find on the station plaza. highly recommend
"first time at happy italy , didnt know the place but turns out is an american style fast food italian . huge portions, good quality and very fast service , all for very cheap prices  not fancy but simple and good"
"great service and friendly staff. large portions great for sharing, there also the option to take out your uneaten pizza . crispy light bases and lots of topping we all really enjoyed our choices.  tuna and salmon ones we can recommend."
i can appreciate the well thought-out marketing concept of this place. the food served is cheap and good portion ed (although i never had a problem finishing my plat 
visited this restaurant after a long day of travelling. great atmosphere with pleasant helpful staff. food and portion size is really good value for money. a must if you visit arnhem.
"my wife and i loved arnhem and looked for a comparatively inexpensive place to rest our weary bones and enjoy a light meal and some beer and wine - after spending a long day at the fabulous k-m museum. the staff were very friendly and the management gave us a wonderful table next to a window. patti chose pasta and i enjoyed my pizza. lovely atmosphere. i recommend the place to all south african visitors to arnhem, especially those bemoaning the current rand exchange trends. by the time we left, there were queues outside the door, in very cold temperatures!"
"this is a favorite amongst us broke college students since you get a good amount of food for a good price, and pizzas are usually on the table within 6 minuet "
happy italy is really fast and provides loaded plates for little money. salmon salad was fine. salmon pasta was too much pasta and too little salmon. passed on this comment as staff are pleased to be informed on this.
"they have good italian food but i love the pizza nutella most. the menu is in dutch, germany, and english, althouh i wonder why they dont have menu of drinks ."
"afligem beer. tasty pizza. very good value. fast service, apart from the second round of beers. we will be back!"
"nicely decorated, great atmosphere. good italian food for a great price. fast service and responsive staff. located right in arnhem city center and right next to arnhem central train station. next to a big movie theater called pathe. recommended :)"
great tasting ice cream. a huge selection of flavours so there is something for everyone. nice service.
great ice creams. also vegan option. downside is that when the wether is good there always is a line. mostly it will not take too long however. parking in the neaighbourhood is not too difficult
"a well-furnished modern restaurant, young and very kind waiters. thin and crispy pizza. recommended for a quick dinner. price reasonable"
nice restaurant in nijmegen at plein 44. easy parking at the molenpoort passage roof parking. 5 min walk to plein 44. restaurant was almost fully booked..tuesday evening around 18.45 arrival. ordered pizza and bread which was good. personnel is very customer friendly although i had to wait 15 min for my bill.
the food is delicous and zappas has a nice atmosphere and its a good place to go for a night out.     .
great place for lunch and dinner. superb food quality and friendly service. the restaurant has a very open atmosphere and the seats are comf 
"the food we ordered was excellent, well worth the wait, but unfortunately the wait was quite long. there were 5 or 6 people behind the bar and in the kitchen, but only two on the floor. judging by a sign theyre still looking for staff, but they could improve service by assigning specific tables to someone, since the tables more to the right were constantly looked after. it took some time before someone gave us a menu and asked us if we wanted something to drink, but the food did make up for the wait + it opened recently. hope/expect service will improve once they have more experience. if you have some time, its totally worth it (which the full tables prove)"
when i have dinner in nijmegen solo i often end up in a burger place. a regular restaurant usually takes to long and i feel a bit uncomfortable by myse 
"8 of us stopped in for dinner. we all ordered pizzas, the quality was really good. the prices were decent, typical netherlands so a little above average. however the wait staff forgot most of our orders and it took a while to receive our food and to finally pay at the end. wont be too harsh though since they seemed new. would definately go back and give it another try. "
friendly & fast service with great cafetaria food and awesome pizza!! their delivery is super...the food is still hot.
dined here this evening ... friendly ambience on the street and inside. nice selection of wines and tasty bites. clearly a wine bar patronized by locals and what better compliment can an owner receive. we enjoyed a nice spanish tempranillo along with a tasty charcuterie board and bruschetta. terrific place ...wish it was closer home.
"good evening ensured at this place. great staff, good service, amazing wines, special beers and tasty bites. they also have a great basement which can be used for parties, meetings or workshops."
"i really like a nice winebar and have found no better one than lebowski in nijmegen. very nice wines, professional and good service, they actually know their wines. and also nice bites to go with the wine. they have (normally) pricey wines by the glass for an affordable price, which makes it easier to try something nice! a must go in nijmegen."
