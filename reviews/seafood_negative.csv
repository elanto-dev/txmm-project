"went here for a lunch/snack. paid a total of €12,55 for 2 medium sized portions of fries and 2 snacks. after almost 30 minutes our fast food arrived. it looked like small portions of fries but the lady ensured me this was normal. also the berehap snack which is known for being a big snack fitted in a small frikandel-sized cart "
had to go here due to the only other real good fish snack bar being closed. this will be the last visit here as well. i didnt like the very fluffy kibbeling ( not crunchy) at all.
"the restaurant is situated at the south of amsterdam, named as amstelveen district. as the district does not have too many prime options, this place comes to top destinations in terms of ambiance. indoor and outdoor sitting options together with the design increases your expectatio "
"be aware the service staff is totally not trained or have even any experience, you have to wait a long time for your food, one point of time te waiter go and redo te string of his shoes without washing his hands he take the cutleries and serve the table i told mij wijf look at this and guess what happen he served our table i went en clean the cutleries first, than at 21.30 hr a whole tray of beer went in to the kitchen and all kitchen staff started to drink beer and wines. as said its manage as family business without service. the restaurant is so noisy and on top of this every 20 minutes your loud throughout the restaurant the happy birthday songs voor children parties of adult dinners , you want to have a nice dinner without stress this is sure not the place as the tables are packed on each other for that even the food is quite good but the rest you have to forget."
"this restaurant is a prime location for gorden ramsey to save! if you want to spend alot of money for an unripe tomatoe and fake mozerrela passing as bufola , wait two hours for soggy pasta in a puddel of canned tamatoe sause bought at the local supermarkt, be my guest as you will not be theirs as they do not care about you ,at all! the service was arrogant, extremely slow,and unresponsive. do youself a favor and look somewhere else. the are some great restaurants in the area, this is certianly not one."
"i went for take away pizza here in corona time. they were open for business which deserves a compliment. i wish i could say the same about the pizza. it was well below par - tasteless pie and cheap ingredients. i don’t know it this is related to the corona times, but i fear not. not recommended - there is plenty much better pizza around"
"we ordered pizza at home, it was disgusting. the ingredients are cheap as hell how dare you calling mozzarella a cheap cheese? never again, there are so many good places to eat, stay away from this one.."
"first time nearby town decided to try out this restaurant.  food: average, too much salt on my rib eye. overall texture was good.  the tiramisu is nice, balance taste and soft.  ambience: overall very comfortable environment, good for family gathering place. nice backyard."
"ambience of the restaurant was nice, service staff friendly.. unfortunately the food was. it up to m "
"nice ambiance. terribly slow service. staff does not look around to see if anyone needs service. we had to chase up staff for every step of the way: our first drink, for a menu-card, for ordering the food, for a dessert-menu card, for the dessert. my own main course was fine; my partners was much too salty. after again having had to wait for 10 minutes for someone to order our dessert we decided to leave without the dessert as no one was paying any attention to our attempts to snare a staff member. our total visit lasted 90 minutes in which we managed to drink 2 glasses of wine and have a main course; most of the time was spent on waiting and trying to attract attention from the staff. as no staff paid any attention we left our table to get the bill and pay at the till, where the staff member had the temerity to state we had only had to wait 5 minutes before being serv "

"with a colleague of mine we decided to have a dinner here during a business trip, after learning that the food was excellent. when we entered the restaurant we were not impressed by the atmosphere inside, which seemed a bit old and not entirely proper. the garden, however, was amazing and we sat outside with pleasure. it was a spacious garden with green view and wonderful sunshi "
"indonesian food is definitely something to have in amsterdam, probably the best food you can get. we had high expectations about ron but we found it was average compared to other indonesian plac "
"we waited 30 min to be approached by the waiter who threw down a cocktail list and ‘street food’ menu. when the waiter appeared 20 min later i asked for the food menu. i was told to order starters from the menu given. i explained i’d like to see the actual menu so as to gage how and what to order. i had to ask twice after this for actual menu. we were finally served out drink order an hour after we arrived. it then took another hour for our main courses to arrive-could not get a waiter or any staff over to refresh drinks, serve water or even acknowledge we were sitting there. our food finally arrived after 1 hour and 50 min from time of reservation. food was cold and unappetizing. one of our main courses was forgotten and when we finally got the attention of the waiter they brought it out, we had finished eating by that time- it was warm though. bad food, horrible horrible service. they offered free tea and coffee to make up for a very disappointing experience, and pretty disgusting food."
"we booked to go to the restaurant with family who were visiting from abroad. the restaurant were very nice in accommodating our request to sit at the back but unfortunately our experience after that was less positive. the waitress who served us was extremely rude and very inattentive and unprofessional. our guests as well as myself have specific dietary requirements. we asked what their famous buffet entailed to which (including a strict no seafood or shellfish dietary requirement) a response of chicken, beef and it and rice was given. the waitress was extremely short and rude (guests were english and even they noticed this and commented). she was smiling whilst serving other tables so we couldn’t quite understand this. to say that she ruined our evening was an understatement. at a certain point we even saw her looking at our table making faces whilst talking to a colleague. when our food arrived, there were prawn crackers on both my dish that i ordered as well as the buffet. in addition to this, most apart from 3 dishes of the 8 were meat dishes and the rest veggie. one of the dishes being the crackers that they serve when you come in with some peanut sauce. we left having spent close to €200 and not having an enjoyable evening at all. this is not the first time we’ve been to this restaurant but the first time we’ve had such a negative experience. before leaving we let the manager know what had happened and his response was ‘unfortunately i cannot do anything to remedy the situation now’. all i can say is we won’t be going back especially if our feedback wasn’t taken seriously in any way! huge disappointment!"
we split two rice tables between three which was sufficient. the food was excellent unlike the service.  our main waitress was uncooperative and rude. she must have been aware because she got better as the evening wore on.
"employee who greeted us was rather abrupt and rather cocky. other employees were pleasant. asked to sit outside next to river and employee remarked, “it’s raining” i asked if we could sit in yard off back of restaurant and she again replied, “it’s raining”. it wasn’t raining just cloudy but pleasant. i felt they just didn’t want to serve us on their beautiful deck. kitchen was open to restaurant and fascinating to watch. decor was authentic and lovely. food was delicious."
"hardly any vega dishes and the ones oredered were extremely dissapointing. overcooked, flacid, tasteless gado gado... too acidic and no substance fake tartare. rissoles were ok but all flavors repeated in gado gado. pricey too."
"we came with high expectations, as ron blaauw is a renowned chef. well, and actually thats the problem with tv chefs opening up restaurants in multiple numbers, they seem to lose control and lose the eye for details. actually, that seems to be exactly the case at ron gastrobar indones "
"had high expectation for this restaurant, since it bears the name of ron blaauw. he has a rather outspoken opinion on the way a restaurant should be judged: performance of the kitchen brigade over restaurant ambiance and sta "
"food, service and ambiance were okay: the chef even came to give us a quick visit. however: very cramped table that was absolutely unfit to accommodate a ‘rijsttafel’ for four. the high chairs were very uncomfortable. the restaurant snelle heavily of cooking smells (perhaps an issue with the kitchen ventilation) so your cloths smell of food which is very annoying when you have something else afterwards. then, we got a quite significant discount as we left before 19 hrs (we didn’t know this upfront) yet i fail to see how this fits into the concept of what ron’s gastrobar pretends to  "
"at the end of the dinner i had the same feeling as when i visit a mac donald: i don’t want to hear about it for the next 3 months...the rijstafel is a combination of very strong flavours and spices covering the taste of the meat or fish. too much cocoa, too much peanut butter. good just for once in a long while"
"the disappointment started with the reservation. i had a groupon, but all groupon seats were sold out for the weekend. when i asked when i could redeem the voucher the answer was: thats not my problem. when we finally got the reservation on a thursday night we were met at the door by some very friendly staff. the groupon allowed for 1 starter per person from the menu + the rijst tafel + a desert. the starters were tasty except for the taco. these had so much mayonnaise that you basically tasted nothing else. not even sure why there is mayonnaise in indonesian food. the rijst tafel was very tasty, with rather small portions. really needed the rice as a filler. the place was relatively busy, so i took very long to get our food. the wine list is good, yet pricy. overall the food and wines are nice, but overcharged. i have also had much better indonesian food at much more affordable prices. if you like to eat at the high end of the market in a trendy environment you will probably like the place. i am not sure if i will be back as i dont think you get sufficient value for money."
"i am actually rather apprehensive of typing a negative review for this gastrobar, as i have heard and seen fantastic reviews for it. perhaps, the experience differed so drastically as i had ordered it via a food delivery app. instead of enjoying the food as most of the other guests have evidently had, we found that the food served was absolutely appalling and worse than most hawker centre fare that we have had back in our hometown of singapo "
"the location is fantastic, but i didnt find the food to add anything to the standard indonesian rice tables you find everywhere else in amsterdam.   it was really good, but it lacks that special something that all the other ron gastrobars bring."
"i have been several times in different restaurant from ron blauw and i never experienced such a rude waitress. we arrived to the restaurant with a groupon, i had a problem with the printer and i called the restaurant to know if i could forward the groupon to them, they said no probl "
price & what is deliverd do not match. friendly people and clean restaurant. we discovered at home the quality and that was not for a 2nd time.
i went there after reading others reviews. food was not at all tasty. the dumplings menu said chicken and prawns but i didn’t taste any prawns at all. the pieces were too small for the price. the soups were not warm at all and they were too creamy with coconut milk and slagroom i guess. the main dish of vegetables red curry was too sweet. 
"we tried diwali’s butter chicken, i have never had such a sweet sauce ever , they are not cheap and i expect the best, there was 25% tofu in our butter chicken meal, as it was, there was mot much chicken in the dish, never again, will be going back to indian kitchen for our next orders."
"i am from england and am used to excellent indian cuisine. basically what we got ( indian menu) was more like take out food..pretty bland. lacked a lot of spicing and was sloshed in rather undefinable sauces. waiters very friendly, location good, very clean."
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill 
"fantastic food and service generally friendly, but made several mistakes with the orders and as a result we had a very long wait for our meal without any recognition.  a shame as the food was excellent."

"as i live close to this beautiful restaurant, ive been to this restaurant regularly. as i really liked the atmosphere and quality of the food, i booked this restaurant for a business meeting. what a disappointment it was. first of all, not all food was properly cooked, leaving me with a semi-raw langoustine. second of all, one of the waiters a) didnt at all know what he was serving and b) didnt have a clue about the accompanying wine and finally staff my dietary request was completely forgotten when serving the cheese platt "
i can only describe our experience as very disappointi 
"when we arrived we were greeted courteously, but then we were seated somewhere away in a corner, although we had reserved. so we asked to be moved as we like to soak up the atmosphere. the atmosphere was really good, relaxed and its easy to have a conversation. the tables are also nicely spread out so that you dont have the feeling that someone can listen into your conversati "
"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
the tempura is always reliable. tried something different and i am still deciding on eating it.  the beer is kirin and sappro always good.
"the food was ok, but the service was slow and somewhat unattentive. moreover, it was very cold in the restaurant, which made the overall experience a lot less than expected."
oversll the food is pretty good here however.... we had two beef tepanyaki’s one was excelent one was overcooked. we also had the crispy shrimp roll menu shows 8 pieces with caviar on the outside served were 6 pieces of cold bland rolls with caviar on the inside (supposedly). all individual sushi is pictured as 2 pieces with a price but prices are per piece (mentioned as a note on the menu). after complaining to the waitress nothing was done no attempt to correct this or compensate us. eventhough mostly good (but pricey) food the service and deceptive menu won’t make me go back.
"i ordered ramen. it smells like toilet. topping pork slice especially smells spoilt lard. as soon as i felt this is not a food that i should eat, i returned it to the restaurant. finally they charged me all including this non eatable food. i know japanese food and service very well, their food and serve are far below the ones i know. never come back again."
"competition has definitely caught up and this place is just too far from amsterdam for me to visit (was worth the trip before, now not so much).  people serving are helpful however, nothing to fault on that side."
"being used to the cosy japanese atmosphere in amstelveen i tried this new venue. not only was the service not up to the way i was used to it, but i missed the japanese atmosphere that was so nice in the old place. food was average, service was o.k, but not like i was used  "
good food bad service! food portion also very small. not very expensive but it is affordable. have a nice environment and right next to a shopping center.
"i ate here several times and the food was fine; really simple rolls, nothing surprising, but fairly good. until today when i made a reservation, arrived on time and they told me to wait at the bar... where there was no room for four people. so we had to wait outside, in the cold for 20 minutes, because the restaurant is so small there is no room for waiting inside. the worse part was that the hostess was not even apologetic, but plainly rude. i was so surprised in the beginning, when she told us that our table was not ready and refused to give me an estimated time, that i waited until she told me we could finally sit down. we never received an apology, not even a nice face... she was sassy and bad tempered all the time, as if it had been our fault! i decided i had had enough and went to loetjes in ouderkerk, where people are friendly and steak is great."
"we go to this place a lot for lunch with friends or for business. the place looks like a real japanese traditional place which is nice, but radio background was always blasting loudly. , too bad since the atmosphere of the restaurant doesnt fit with the noise. the service is okay, can be much better if they smile more instead of acting a bit annoyed that we are coming to eat there. never stop us in coming back though. the good food with good value top everything else :)"
"the sashimi was very good,everything else was too much overcooked or rotten: my girlfriend puked a bucket full at home."
"amstelveen has a large japanese community but no japanese dine here, even though it is centrally located. food, just about bearable considering people origined from a nation nearby preparing, however, please do not mistake in any way that this is how the japanese serve their guests. you must bare in mind this is a japanese themed restaurant run by people from other asian country and if you know the real thing you just would not touch it. everything over priced using cheapest possible material, fooling customers who would not know any better. unfortunately, this trend seems quite common everywhere. real shame. "
"first review ever here, and only because the experience was so bad that i couldnt not say anything. ive long believed that food should be the most important part of dining out, and that most reviewers are oversensitive (or entitled) when it comes to service, but in this case the service was so disappointing that it cast a pall over anything else tanuki actually did rig "
"came in at the tail end of lunch service (3:30) was told that the place closes at 4. though no problem as we just wanted a quick bite. after taking 15min to bring us our order, however, we were given less than 10 minutes to finish our meal when at 3:52 the waiter comes and puts his finger in my bowl and takes it from me in mid bite! hey im not done  i say. i told you 2 time you leave at four! he says. its still 350 i say. he does not respond and proceeds to walk away with my unfinished tuna bowl. i thought i was on some sort or hidden camera sho "
"i went to tanuki last monday, 9th december, with a friend for lunch. this was my second time there. first time was good food, it was busy but we got our food with a reasonable delay. this time we arrived, waited to be seated for a few minutes at the door as the waiter made a few eye contacts with us, but failed to tell us that he will be with us shortly. then we decided maybe it is better to sit somewhere without reserved sign, then the waiter ran to us asking us to sit at a table finally, we told him we would rather sit at a big table sharing with others. we took the menus, made our choice and started waiting for the waiter, when we made clear we already know what we want, he refused to come as there was another table still going through their menus, yes they were before us, but our waiter preferred to wait for them, his gestures and body language started becoming a bit annoying at that moment. in principle we were ok as the other table was there before us. then a japanese gentleman showed up, sat at the big table sharing it with us. then our waiter greeted him, and immediately took his order without any issues. we immediately decided to leave the place, although food is very good, this waiter was extremely rud "
"this restaurant is highly regarded as the japanese restaurant in amstelveen, which has a large japanese community. i am sure that the food can be good at tanuki given its reputation, but in our case, it was inconsistent at be "
this is a smart well decorated restaurant but the quantity of gnocchi with bolognaise sauce was insufficient for a starter and i ordered it as a main. suggest you choose the chinese next door and get some decent food.
our hotel recommended this one and it was full of tourists from other hotels that recommended it. the wait staff were disagreeable with each other and it carried over into their service. the food came out on time but we were stressed after our dinner from the cold atmosphere in the room. we ordered the main course ravioli to share as an appetizer and it was good—one large piece of ravioli. we ordered the grilled fish sampler for main course. the sole was good as was the tuna and shrimp but the salmon was over cooked. we ate at some terrific restaurants and cafes during our three days here and this was one i would skip.
"too bad! asian quality restaurants in the the netherlands continue on a low level. amber garden was highly recommended to us , so we had high expectations when we booked a table. the place looks promising when you enter, clean, large, many people and the menu looks promising too. we had some dim sum as a starter, was ok,but they forgot to serve the sauces .we had the duck spring rolls, very nice! we ordered duck and fried rice and seabass. the duck arrived cold and dry, was overcooked, no sauces. the rice never arrived, the sea bass was nice and fresh, but not prepared the asian way, no spices no sauce. still no rice!!! finally when we finished the main courses the fried rice arrived, again not hot at all and no taste. too bad!"
quite a beautiful and modern restaurant with friendly staff. everything looks modern and kitchen very clean. food is very good and many authentic and special dishes are on the menu (which menu in the form of a stunning booklet 
because of the covid closure we decided to order the dinerbox from aan de po 
a two michelin-star rated restaurant has to be really impressive. this restaurant only impressed in price. the portion sizes were ridiculously small. the chef even came out and told us at the start the portions would be small! i guess we could have left then. the food quality was good but at these prices and quantities i would take the nearby jonge dikkert any day!
to be honest - we expected much more. the chefs menue looked fantastic and we started off with a beautiful raw kingfish dish. after that flavours became a bit flat with as major disappointment the eel with foie and appel which was just too much together - made u think of pancake with bacon and apple. staff was nice and chefs personal attention was well received.
"made reservations with american express centurian months earlier. we were seated at the darkest table next to the door with no view. waitress approached the table and asked if e wanted and an aperitief, a glass of wine or a cocktail. i asked for a specific vodka on the rocks and my husband a martini. waitress responds with we can make hers but we cant make a martini(why offer a cocktail) (what?). then, all of a sudden someone found our reservation and moved us to a better table (we didnt say a word about the first one). serving staff plopped down the amuse bouche, but couldnt be bothered to explain indetail. if youre putting it on the plate, tell me why it should be there, or if too confusing, leave it off. the young woman who was the sommelier was very informative and helpful on the other hand. food. dissapointing at best. eaten at le bernadin and latelier de joel rubuchon, where the late chef roubuchon came and talked to us about his food, amoung many starred restaurants and this was disappointing. poor discriptions and very little harmony in the ingrediants. take the smoked eel. long strip of eel drapped across a bowl (why so much). and a little glob of foie gras in the middle. foie is so delicate the eel totally over whelmed it. no respect for the ingrediants. my husband felt the poor service was because we werent local, but why should that matter in a 2 starred restaurant. staff needs better training in service, like what the meaning of the word is, and kitchen needs to tighten up, less ingrediants to confuse, just let the product sing on its own! would not recommend. "
"for this is a fine dining restaurant, i expected a warm welcome, attentive service, and excellent food. in the whole dining, i couldnt not find a waiter or waitress to give me a smile. the tone was robotic and efficient as if we were in a fast food chain store: “please eat and g "
had to wait for ages and didnt think the food was great.... and for those prices!!! staff i thought were also rude which made it all in all not a good choice for a family birthday meal.
"food is of course good and beautifully displayed in this 2-star michelin restaurant. nice terrace, too bad there were no white table cloths on the black tables. we also found the staff to be a bit underdressed (jeans and sneakers). staff did whatever they needed to do correctly but nothing more. too bad the high-and-mightiness that seems to be typical for many upscale restaurants in and around amsterdam, also found its way to aan de poel."
"the restaurant was pretty busy for wednesday evening, but seems more the business and show off people. food was ok, has a feeling as invention stopped some time ago and a menu formula was a novelty. some dishes were very well presented, one was really delicious (blackened entrecôte). so at the end i would recommend to have there st jacques and entrecôte. and menu especially the 6 dish is exaggerated - especially in price (think it goes to 90 euros). we did not like the interior and the artificial flowers (in the netherlands?!!) are too cheap for that type of restaurant. there are better places - even very close het bosch , which i have visited many times is beating it easily "
"good food with reasonable price. however, the service and tempo are not worth the two star at all. we wait for almost one hour for dessert and the four courses set took us 160 mins...it also took more than 10 mins to get check. its a truly awful experience and i wont visit again for sure."
we went to the restaurant 4 people. drank a lot of wine and paid the bill without studying it closely. later on we discovered that we were charged for 5 people instead of 4 for the 5-course dinner that we ha

"i can be real short on this one: rude and unfriendly service, acceptable food, nice location. please stay away."
"we had very high expectations but nothing was special about the restaurant, service was below average far from 2 michelin star standards, service people was having an otiose arrogance, food was nothing special, dressings of food was good but taste was not that special, ambiance is also nothing special"
"rude staff, i do not recommend this restaurant.  there are many other great options close by.  stopped by on a tuesday evening and have never had a worse experience."
"went with pretty high hopes and recommendations. went well on arrival, champagne and oysters on beautiful terrace, but then nothing. sat for 30 mins with empty glasses. chased down a waiter who sent someone to our table and we asked for a glass of wine that would go with the first course. nothing for another 20 mins and i had to chase down a waiter again. i actually asked if there was something wrong because there seemed to be a swarm of confused looking staff but no service. no apology, no understanding of our situation, in fact, their answer was about having 80 covers and it being difficult when everyone moves from outside terrace to inside. hmm, made to feel i shouldnt have complained. wont be going back here. made me feel i was in a chain restauran "
"if it were just for the taste of the food i would definitely recommend aan de poel. we had the 6 course alliance menu recommended by the chef and all dishes were very tasty, with simple ingedients and not too molecular. only down side with the menu was that the portions remained very small, and even for a tiny person like me, i was quite hungry after all amuses, starters and mains, so i had to order some extra cheese. i have never experienced this in a michelin star restaura "
we were checking out this place to celebrate our honeymoon party in december. so we were sitting on the bar and ordered a beer. then they told us we could not get a drink on the bar if we were not also eating. so we told our story that we were checking out the place and we also would like to see the menu. then they told us friendly to leave....
"the food was beautiful. all the flavours went together marvelously. we had the 6 course seasonal menue. however, after having spend a lovely evening, we were shocked when the valet told us that our car was broken into! in the restaurants parking lot and under their supervision. the thief stole my working laptop in the trunk. very unfortunate event, the security should have been tighter, especially since they told us it was the second time within a year that this had happened."
"after a great time here in 2010 we went back. this time the food and service were of much lower quality. the price / quality ratio is not ok. no really outstanding dishes as before. service is often slow and not really professional. at the end the bill had several errors. correcting the bill took very long, while we had indicated to be in a hurry. the waiter even let the new bill wait at his desk and went to bring drinks to other guests, before handing us the bill. all the time we were waiting at the exit. very rude. we had a bad experience."
"we had only 2 hours to finish our dinner (which were not told in advance) but we waited 40 minutes before the first dishes were served, we had no choice but to leave several dishes unfinished because the serving was so slow, would not recommend this place despite the decent food and their inflated popularity. "
this was the most untasty and bad looking sushi i ever eat in my life. tampura was greasy and pale taste. old oil is used in all fried things tasted very ugly. edamame overcooked. sushi had very little fish. service was rude. the owner was not listening to our feedback and blamed us. one of our friends had to puke the food.

good food but very bad service. reservation is not honoured in busy season. there is no guaranteed seating even with advance reservation on weekends. any food not partly eaten that remain on the plate is charged. one year old baby who ate no food but simply slept in the stroller was charged 6.50 euros. the restaurant is staffed with rude chinese staff who serve the tables inadequately and always tried to impose extra bottles of drink. upstairs is worse than downstairs for attentive customer service. visited this restaurant 5 times in the summer of 2015. found a better place in amstelveen for sushi right next door. it is called tanuki japans eetcafé 
"looked nice from the outside, but turned out to be a massive all-you-can-eat place. luckily we managed to work around this for lunch. service was fi "
this is a nice restaurant with a warm atmosphere but unfortunately the sushi was tasteless and the tempura had a oily taste. the tuna sashimi was worthless. the service was very good though. but i am definitely not coming back again. not worth my money
i am with a friend right now to the restaurant. the service is slower than death. plates in all you can eat are coming 1 every 5-7 minutes. the waitor has pause his work to talk with some friends for more than 15 minutes and we have already wait to order for the second round. its a mess. the quality is good but not as other restaurants
cheap all you can eat japanese hangout. fully booked nearly every evening so make to to make reservations (should you crave for sushi and have a low budget...)
"well, expecting a great lunch we entered a huge room with only one other guest -- but still had to wait a lot. moreover we had to fill in the choosen articles ourselves, adhering to the procedure (very cumbersome if you need a quick lunch during work and there are no other guests...). food was served in microportions at (high) fixed prices. no ice in the coke, and the spicy thai beef was bad meat without any taste (soup quality but t-bone price) covered with a huge pile of watery paprika = tasteless peppers. fried chicken was like the quality of mc donalds. actually i had a chicken burger after this meal, we left after 20 minutes, complained politely but got no reaction at all and had to pay the full price. shame on you, but we now understand why the place is so empty..."
"we made a reservation, but our table was not ready at the time we arrived. then we had to wait at the bar, where no seats were available. the acoustic in the restaurant is quite bad, it is very noisy. the food was good, although we did not receive all the dishes we ordered due to the sloppy way the dishes are served."

"good food and fresh, but terrible service. we had the eur 25 all you can eat. which means choosing 5 dishes in 5 orde "
"all-you-can-eat is not my cup of tea, but some of my colleagues like this restaurant, so i take business lunches at kokusai occasional "
"super great food, and big portions. but the staff was not very professional, we sat inside under the stairs and ashes of a cigarette fell from upstairs on our table. we told the staff and they did nothing to compensate, very bad. not planning to go back! "
very bad service. long wait for being served. we left after the main course after being 2 hours in the restaurant. very bad experience.
had dinner here for first time. we went on a frid 
"we have been there 5 times. every time we like the food and ambience but yesterday really pissed me off when i saw there was no outdoor seating. during covid, they are making you seat close by with other guests which really pissed me off. the lady at the reception was adamant that she couldnt seat me elsewhere which is nonsense because they have huge seating area inside and many places were vacant. atleast they should mention this in their website. i repeatedly requested her to make me seat not somewhere closer with other people but she was very rude and didnt seem to bother so much. rest all is fabulous for us. great for kids, big gatherings. really good parking space.we enjoy the food as well. but forced to give a 3star rating for the lady´s ungrateful behaviour yesterday."
this asian restaurant is located in amstelveen which is close to the airport. there is ample free parki 
as always huge japanese restaurant with so many courses for so much money...most folk dont get through the whole number of courses. food is reasonable average japanese. service is friendly. excellent free parking. good for families..but if you are not with kids go later on in the evening..its quite noisy with kids running all over the place early on in service time. wine pricey for the quality.
"wisiting the restaurant on a wednesday evening, 12 people in total. the consept of ordering several small dishes time after time is actually a good way of serving asian food. but with that mann people on one table, it was caotic. a lot of the dishes look the same, and without any nametag on, the caos starts at once. but in the end, we all had our stomach filled up. the taste of the food was a bit disapointing. i exepect more taste and flavour from this kind of food, and often you can choose how strong you want the taste. but in the end we had a buffet with cakes and icecream. that was yummi."
this is not the first time we eat in this restaurant but this is the first time they asked us to leave 30 minutes before out time limit don 
the place is amazing and mode 
"large but set up in areas so it still feels cozy. friendly personal. food not bad at all, several of my japanese friends say so. wine is simple, sake only warm."
"the all-you-can-eat menu is fine as, if you are very hungry, you may indeed eat a lot and for reasonable price. plus : free parking. the quality is ok but is not exceptional."
"im never very excited about all you can eat formula. in this case my worst fears were confirmed. the food is basically not alive, it seemed it had been prepared a long time before being serv "
"comparing to the similar other restaurant as sushi eat as much as you can the quality is rather high, although its not real japanese but chinese copy. only bad remark is we can order only 4 items in once, so we have to wait very long till we get next order. so, in the first half we became very hungry. but by the end we could became full stomach. so, it is ok. we want to visit there again."
"some points to consider, before you visit the pla "
"fixed menu with 5 courses , 4 dishes each of sushi and sashimi. some of the japanese waiters were unable to explain the dishes to help the menu selection. sushi dishes were average"
"fussia is an aziatic eatfactory. a topic when you dine with a group. but no ambiance if you celebrate a special occasion for a couple. regularly there is someone who is celebrating his or here anniversary and than they serve a fireworkfountain. nice, but then half of the people starts to sing. thats nothing for us. the all you can eat formula is apparently a nice thing for a broad public. but by our opinoion there are better restaurants in this range in aalsmeer en amstelveen. nevertheless, we had a good meal and the service was good. very fast and exactly according to our demand. nice! especially when you take in considerance that all seats were occupied."
"there is a good choice of sushi and other dishes like yakatori, duck, chicken e "
"i wouldnt even call it japanese. bad, really bad. quality of food is bad, recipes are probably worse. the place is depressing and the music makes you feel like you are listening to the worst commercial radio station."
"the good and quick behavior of the room staff cannot mask the low capability of the kitchen: the grilled mix is not grilled at all, the french fries are not french at all, the vegetarian dishes are not attractive..."
"menu and decor and staff all the same. pleasant waiters, easy wine, no advise with combi food and wine. food is simple and ok. close to hotel and around the area not much other choice"

"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "
place looks quite nice but limited menu. not very busy but still they managed to forget to bring veg with mail course. ruined the meal. i used to go before the rebranding and reopening but never again. owners need to check and train staff. our table were not the only ones having issues that evening...

"this restaurant is next to the grand hotel in amstelveen (less than a minute walk) and is basically the only place to eat when you dont want to go somewhere else by car or taxi. service and food are good, but nothing really outstanding. its perfect for a quick dinner after a long day of work. staff speaks fluentl english, so easy also for foreign guests."
"this bistro may be nice, but not more than that. it seems to cater mainly to visitors of the nearby hotel (no restaurant of its own) and of the sports complex as there is nothing else around. i gu "
"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
"very bad service. no attention from personnel and arrogant.  actually the restaurant is not crowded,  not recommended to visit."
on 14th we expressly drove by to book a table at the waterside for 16th june. the waiter said he could not guarantee the table at the waterfront.
"dont waste your time to go there.  rude staff, bad service, you wont get attention as a customer and it will take years to get your meal"
outdoor space was beautiful right on the river but not used for dinner service?!?! we had to sit inside a rather warm dining room with a view of the river across the street. waiter was pleasant and polite. food was good but fairly expensive.
"the service of this place is the worse i had in years, they came 5 time to bring us a capuccino and a cake that we didn’t order, took so long to get anything you order. looks like every waiter is at their first day work. great location, food mediocre. go there only for drinks if you have no hurry"
food mediocre. service horrible. they just throw the wine on the table and expect you to open the bottles and pour the wine. left over french fries sat on the table for a few of us during dessert. do they think we will eat cold french fries with the dessert??? aweful. will never go back 
i visited for lunch on wednesday 19 september. the group of 4 ordered varous sandwiches and i asked for a vegetarian sandwich without goat’s cheese. the waitress said that they did not have sny other options and i was served bread rolls with a (small) side of truffel mayonaise. i got the impression that she (or the chef) couldn’t care less. i would have got a better sandwich in a simple cafe. disappointed!
"we arrived & stood waiting on the terrace to be seated while 2 waitresses stood at the bar ignoring us. i then asked them for a table & they pointed to a dirty table that we sat at. after 5 minutes the waitress cleared it but i had to get our own menus. waited 10 minutes & asked twice for drinks which eventually came. food was not as slow as staff and was nice although had to get our own cutlery. at one stage while customers waiting, one waitress stood on street chatting to friends. lovely location but cafe loetje much much better. "
"the food was oke for the price, but the service staff unprofessional and not on top of it. the 3 menu courses where fine. the lobster sauce that comes with the fish was very little on the plate. asking for more... twice... nothing happend, waiting to long for everything that was ordered."
"this restaurant is very good for dinner. the menu has few vegetarian options or only 1 i can say. however, it good. service was also good, but what i liked the most is location, love to have dinner on a waterside restaurant. parking is also available."
"we have eaten at paardenburg several times as it is a great spot for lunch on a terrace by the water. service was never great and prices are a little on the high side but this time service was just so bad that we will probably not be back. at our arrival, the restaurant was only 1/4 full but we had to wait 10mn for someone to attend to us. then the waiters had to discuss between them for another 5mn to understand if the table we wanted was reserved or not (it was not). when we were seated, no one offered a menu card nor took orders for drinks. after 15mn of waiting and grabbing the attention of waiters we finally got a menu card and managed to order. 5mn later another waiter asked if he could take our order ?!. another 30mn later our dishes had still not arrived and we had to enquire. we were told that the it system was down and that our order had probably not been passed to the kitchen and we were asked to remind them what we had ordered. finally one hour after our arrival we got served. as we paid the bill, the waiter did apologize with a smile but thats it. for a restaurant charging around 30 euros for a main dish at dinner this is simply not an acceptable level of service."
"since april new owner, who wasn’t around. we have been here a dozen times before but this new owner is ruining the place really fa "
forty-five minutes to get food after ordering. no waitstaff visit for second drink. avoid this restaurant!
"the location is absolutely stunning. we went for a bike ride to this restaurant with locals who dine there regularly. we were greeted by a young man who was very sweet but had zero clue about anything on the menu. anything you asked him, his answer was i dont know. another young lady came and took our order. 3 guests ordered just an entree and one guest ordered their 3 course lunch option. one would think that the 1st appetizer course would of come out first for the one guest. no, the 3 entrees came out and the other guest got her appetizer. but i should mention that actually one guest did not get his entree at this time we waited about 20 minutes for his bouillabaisse to come out while our food just sat. at this point we inquired about the entree for the person with the three course and were looked at as if she was shocked that we would of wanted all of our entrees at the same time. she then came back to our table to educate us in a very serious manner on how we cannot expect our entrees to come out all together if one person orders a three course meal. i did not say anything but lesson 101 in the restaurant business, its called coursing. the appetizer should of come out first for the one guest, and then all 4 guests entrees should of come out together. we are now about 1 hour and 30 minutes into our meal when we finally got the last entree. we asked her when she served the last entree (this person is now eating alone as everyone else finished their entree) if she would please bring out the dessert immediately, this never happened. we finally had to ask a 3rd and 4th person if we could receive our dessert. needless to say this lunch of 2 salads, bouillabaisse and a 3 course meal took over 2 hours. luckily we were on vacation and going to have a wonderful time no matter what, but i have never seen such slow service in my life. now as far as the kitchen goes, wow the food was to die for. i will say that a gentleman did approach our table at the end and apologize for how slow it took, which was nice to see that someone acknowledged this was crazy long. i am not sure i would go again but delicious."
"we’ve been here twice sice the change of owner and the service has really changed, but not for the bett "
"we were invited by our business colleagues. nice location, there is some outside seating next to the river. food was average. sea bass was overcooked, nothing special. one would expect better quality for quite high price. service was extremely slow for almost empty restaurant. it took us hour and a half to eat lunch. my recommendation is to look for another place. "
we came here for a groupon deal to taste several dishes. we enjoyed the food and ambience. it is a little bit upmarket and i would have expected better service (has to be more attentive)
sat here to have some drinks right on the river side. worthwhile to come this way on a sunny day. dont expect great service while they where more busy with them selves but for just a drink its good enough.
the setting on the amstel and the terrace are lovely. so stop for an aperitif and go somewhere else for food. 15 euros for dry white toast with a tiny slice of chicken. and 18 euros for about 50 grams of steak tartare. cheapest potato chips on the planet served on the plate. nothing remarkable at all to anything we ate. they are cutting corners and pinching pennies. we were bummed b/c it really looked great from the outside. pick something else nearby. 
"stay away. service was poor, however the food was just awfull.. just tasteless and bad quality.. my sandwich was burned and dry.. the club sandwich was with simple processed chicken slices and old vegetables.. and there was a spider in the food. worst food experience in netherlands so far."
"this restaurant has great food and the view from the terrace was amazing. however, service was awful. there were 6 tables and 2 waitresses serving them, so it wasnt super busy. after we ordered wine and water it took them over 20 mins to arrive. a few tables next to us were not cleaned after the guests for the next hour, whilst waitresses were chatting to each other at the bar. it could have been such a great experience if it wasnt for the service."
"food is not fresh, service very unprofessional and unrespectfull, the room is dirty and you can see an open kitchen full of young students not even 20 years old "
"this spot is really posh, it was my first time in amstelveen but it is really very much to be recommended compared to crowded and dirty amsterd "
ordered some oysters to start and followed by the quality meat. meat was indeed of good quality but its a bit overcooked. ordered medium rare but seemed it was a bit more to the end of medium well. but it was still tasty as the meat was very flavorful. the ambience was good and you could have a nice talk with your friends over lunch sitting by the canal. 
"came here for lunch ... friendly service, nice setting, enough privacy, and the food was good but not great. however, this restaurant has done enough for me to be back."
last evening we were taken to this waterside eateries by some business colleagues who live in the neighbourhoo 
"we came here with a group of 4 colleagues on a beautiful evening and were able to sit out on the terrace, the location is lovely next to the river. unfortunately we had really bad service (we had to ask 3 times for a bread basket and ended up waiting over 30 minutes for one), the food was very average and rather overpriced. stop in for a drink but look elsewhere for food."
"waiting, waiting and waiting! seriously, 15 guest at the patio. how hard can it be? great view and good food though, ill give it an other shot some time."
"went there for lobster friday. what a disappointment! they brought something totally different than what we ordered. hardly any lobster at all while still asking lobster based prices! we were so disappointed. when we complained they totally brushed us off. the guests at the table next to us had the same experience. we were all disgusted by their attitude. will not return! too bad, because the location is really nice."
"nice quiet area, beautiful terrace, friendly staff. menu is not huge, fits on one page, and has nice combination of fish and meats. prices are definitely on high side! the special of the day were the mussels which were ok. not the nice big juicy ones you get on the mediterranean cost, cooked in white wine and bit of garlic and spices. these were on the small side (half as big), rather dry and can taste either white wine or spices. just found some raw carrots and other minced veggies on the bottom of the pot. this place is to enjoy nice al fresco with a cute view, not for amazing seafood at reasonable prices."
have been for supposedly quick lunch in a beautiful setting. we arrived later than planned ( got stuck at pharmacie due to another snail dutch customer service there- arrrrr ) so had no choice but to sit in paardenbu 
"this is a place to visit in the summer, with the terrace next to the river amstel. we arrived by ship for lunch. one of the grandchildren was in a wheelchair, staff was very helpf "
"i am surprised about this restaurant. only 1 piece of bread per person. i ordered 2 appetizers, 2nd one as a main course and this was really no value for money. small portion, only the beef tartar, no vegetables, no bread/ carbs. we got a small cup of fries and salad to share. my colleague had fish, which was ok, but his vegetables were cold. surprising for a restaurant in this location. we got the coffee and tea for free because of the cold sides, but i am still negatively surprised about the lack of value for money....."
"nice restaurant located in a nice place. food is ok, but nothing special. service a bit slow. i have been for dinner and was dark due to winter, but i expect to repeat the experience to valuate the surroundings."
"i was treated to a meal by a friend who is now a bit of a local. he was very excited to bring me to the town of ouderkerk. however, forgot that the nights were drawing in so i did not get to see much of the town itself, although what i saw was pretty enou "
"on a summers day, an attractive proposition... food mediocre and overpriced,   but then were in rich folks territory.....  :-)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of children’s toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbq’ed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."
"having visited this restaurant a dozen times since 1968 when visiting holland, our last experience for dinner was a big disappointment. people who came much later in the dining room were paying their bill while we were served our main cour "
"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. “no problem, sir. your round table is reserved”, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: “ we never book fixed tables sir, sorry”. but….. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"

"gringo’s has known times when the interior was innovative and food surprising. those times are disappearing: ambiance lively but too loud and bad acoustics. steaks lower quality than they used to be, and smaller than they used to be against higher prices. salad must have been prepared and held in the fridge for a long time: no fresh salad leaves, taste of refrigerator humidity dominating, the masking with thick dressing did not take that away.fries were nice but served not completely hot anymore. price-quality levels have gone out of balance too: price too high for what is offered. we said the salad was not tasting ok and not nice. we got apologiesand she would tell the chef. no solution offered and were fully charged. after almost 20 years of returning to gringo’s, we will have to let go of gringo’s."
we had a meal here spoilt by an obnoxious waiter who refused to give us tap water despite us having a full meal with drinks.
"used to be smaller, then they expended and became the mexican version of tgi fridays. unless you were invited i suggest you look for something else."
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"from the outside, the villa ruimzicht looks really impressive. but the rooms cannot meet the expectations. the room weve had was covered with dust. so was the entire hallway. another point of criticism was the service in the restaurant. they were quite disorganized, and in my opinion, the food is slightly overpriced."
"we had meals on two occasions here, once on the terrace (burger/fries - c.19euros) and then in the restaurant. burger was nice but i think a little overpriced. our restaurant meal would have been very nice had my lobster (24euros) been served hot. it was only warm so i had to send it back. friendly staff.

"the dishes can only be order every 20 min and max 4 pieces. portions really really really smal, they say its an all you can eat restaurant but thats not how it works. so if you came here to have a dinner you gonna leave still hungry. service quite rude. i will never come back here again. if you are looking for a all you can eat restaurant you should go somewhere else "
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di

used to visit on a regular basis because dh loved their gyros dish and i liked their lamb chops. i understand their is a new owner and we were not impressed on our last visit. the gyros was bland without the usual spicy garlic flavour he is used to and their lamb chops were no longer accompanied by a thyme flavored sauce but with a brown sauce with a definate maggi flavouring not an improvement at a 
booked for five and no table available when we arrived. table for four was made to fit five food not great but acceptable staff not attentive and one member of staff was very rude to one of our party. avoid is my advice
"i would give this place 5 stars for location, presentation and service. the food however was a let down in my opinion. located just across the old harbour with free parking opposite it and fairly easy access, limani is set in a prime location. the waiters were professional and went the extra mile to cater to our dietary requirements. unfortunately the food was hit and miss. the salmon was great and the salad bar had a reasonable selection. the grilled chicken however tasted like it had served time in the freezer and the rice like it had just come out of an uncle bens bag. it might have just been an unlucky choice for us but im not sure id come back again. "
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"for an italian restaurant, i would say on average the food was disappointing. the main course fish was very good, the arancini i had as a starter were tasteless. wine was nice and the staff are very friendly but not very experienced and didnt seem to have much training. location looked nice but we only got a seat in the bar area as the main restaurant with the nice view was full."

"we attended a family diner for 15 people and we were seated in a corner, at 1 table. for this pre-ordered diner, they served several starters and main courses. dessert was served on plate. it was really a pity that the plates were so large from size, that there was hardly any space on the table. the service was friendly and checked upon us regularly."
"the food was ok but no more than that. we ordered calamaris and parmazan  fries and the calamares were small and overcooked, the fries were good."
dogs are allowed on the beach from october. after a long beach walk we treated ourselves on a delicious apres-walking drink in the beach restaurant kaap-duin. the interior is reminiscent of a xenos store. but who cares
"the food was nice, we had a shared salmon plate. though they forgot one part of the order but still put it on the bill.  personnel refused to speak english and explain couple of things on the menu.  long wait on not a busy day."
"forget the local wifi connection. they wont tell you the password unless its summer season... which wasnt, you guessed right! for entrance bitterballen - rather empty of content but crispy - acceptable. not acceptable was the fact that nobody provided us with cutlery nor napkins... we had to pick it up ourselves. the rest of the dishes was ok ish, both involved chicken thigh "

"realy a lovely place to sit and have a drink.   the kitchen needs attetion. no love or passion was put into it, feels like we were at ikea.  we would go back for a drink, but not for dinner."
"scouting out some family history we found this place on our way back to amsterdam. unlike most places in amsterdam, not much english spoken here (and sadly i dont speak dutch). so make sure you have your translator on your phone! we needed it to read the menu. our food was good. for some reason took longer then everyone else, but we were in no hurry. im sure a great place in the summer with a great view of the water. there were a number of locals there, so guessing pretty popular. oh, almost forgot. they are very pet friendly here apparently. dogs are pretty much allowed everywhere, even restaurants."
"the service is a catastrophy, we were there several times... we were forgotten by the personal, other costumers got seats before us even if they came later, orders were served wrong "
"visited frequently. for drinks only and a uitsmijter. the food was okay but it took long to be served. drinks took way too long to be served out, although there was loads of waiters walking around. not very collaborative. they are friendly to kids, that is nice. inside this building is a not atmospheric, it is high and like a factory. tons of tables and so empty. put up some plants or other loungy decoration. i wont go there for eating out at night. outside you look towards the beach and water but when you look to the left you see factories. it is a weird location, also the outside of the building is weird because it looks like a factory, the terazza is big and too much tables and wooden benches, no cosy corners at all :( . if you want to go somewhere with cosyness dont go here..

"the beachclub has an excellent location right on the beach of lemmer. we had dinner there last sundaynight and it was very busy. apart from the noise we enjoyed our visit. the food they serve is quite okay, although one of our party was not impressed with the mackrel. the rest of the meals were fine. we found the staff very nice and attentiv "
the staff was very kind. wine was very nice. food didn’t seem to be homemade. tomato soup was very sweet.  we will give it another try though.
"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
waiter cashed and cleaned neighboring tables without saying a word or even recognizing me - after 15 minutes i le 
"the location of this place is really nice, right on the water. we only had drinks and snacks and they were fine. but the service was made me give only 3 stars. one girl was okay but the other girl had no idea what she was doing. "
"when you are seated next to the kitchen and the owner/manager is constantly yelling at the staff, when you have to wait 45 minutes between starter and main course, the food better be outstanding. and when it is only good enough the experience is utterly disappointing"
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often there’s more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guest’s conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."

"i had lunch at tante koosje, 11 december 2021. yes quite a while ago, so why i am writing a review now ? because they are so proud of their micheline star, but not acting like it. i had lunch there the food was nice but not unique i have eaten at better one star restaurants. the service was not michelin worthy, it was far away from that. so i wrote a constructive email on 11.12.2021 about it, expecting a reply, which i did not get. then i wrote an email again on 11.01.2022, with a little reminder that a reply would be appreciated, guess what, i did not get a reply. so now after a couple of month i feel lets leave a review. as mentioned already the food is nice, but the price you pay is not only for the food, but also for the service and the service sucked in many ways and does not come near to a michelin star restaurant. there are better one star michelin restaurants where you could go in the netherlands. so my advise safe yourself a trip."

"a very charming location. we were sitting outside but it took too long before we were taken to the table. tasting menu, some fish, some pigeon, ice cream i remember. probably too much messing around with the food..too complicated...without great result. certainly not bad though. wine pairing nice but too much explaining from the brochure without really knowing. water pouring with constant dripping, serving a bit too much from the hip. approx 100 euro per person. "
"dining at tante koosje is always, no fail!, a treat. no exception this time. however, there is bound to be a however. my friends and i also in treated ourselves to the accompanying wine menu. this we should not have done. it was an interesting selection but served with aplomb and supposed knowledge that did not reflect in the taste of the wine. hence the average this ti "
"we were greeted, seated and then just sat there waiting for someone to come to the table to offer us a drink or any form of service. eventually we had to ask for a drink, which came. when my wife and i had both finished our drinks we sat there for a good while before we again had to ask to be served. we had been there for around 30 minutes before the menus came. the lady that served the wine felt it appropriate to just pour the wine and start telling us about it, interrupting our conversation and talking over us. it felt as though you were an imposition to some of the staff by being there and each of us at the table felt the same way. i have had better service at burger king than displayed by some of the staff, the food is not as good but then you dont have to pay 350 euros for it. for a michelin starred restaurant i expect much better, and for the price there are much better restaurants out there."
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91€ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."
"i held my wedding luncheon here with just a handful of guests in 2015. although it was just a small luncheon, my husband and i arrangd this as our only formal celebration. i had arranged some music to be played which the owner agreed to in advance. however, when the time of the event arrived, there was one other table seated at the time with two guests where the owner saw fit to give full his attention and cater to their opinions above ours. i had a wedding with music i couldnt hear and the owner remained preoccupied with sitting by these two other guests the entire time instead of being pleased that two people from other parts of the world chose his restaurant to celebrate their special day. when i asked to be able to hear the music, he chided that i must be considerate of other guests. i was not immediately angry and paid the bill in full but when i later attempted to connect on social media to possibly discuss my issue, i was ignored. a wedding is a once in a lifetime event and so caterers have a responsibility to uphold whereas his attitude is completely unacceptabl "
"a good host knows when you want his attention and when you want him to stay in the background. the host in this restaurant does not. dining here meant we had to pay attention to unnecessary explanations, including some ridiculous wine-for-dummies talk, while we were here for a family gathering, spending some precious time together. the food actually wasnt bad."
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.

"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"

"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "

"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 €. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.
"this restaurant is really unreliable. ive had some very enjoyable evenings there and also some forgetable ones. in august this year i had dinner there, excellent crab starter and mussels to follow. good service and a thoroughly enjoyable evenin "
"we visited kasteel wittem some years ago and had lovely meals there. so, we booked and looked forward to enjoying a special meal. we started with champagne and were served two half glasses of it. after about 20 minutes we got an amuse which was nice. and then it took one and a half hour before we got our starters, which by the way did not require any cooking as we had oysters and a cold selection of foie gras. it then took another half hour to get our main dish, fish. the menu announced asparagus but they were replaced with endives. it was good but nothing special. the wines selected by the sommelier were nice but the quantity per glass was ridiculously small. on the other hand we were supplied with loads of water and bread while we were waiting for the food. we gave up and decided not to have any dessert or coffee because we had no idea when it would arrive on the table. the service was chaotic : we were given a second amuse which in fact was for another table, various waiters came back with the same cutlery, we were offered the menu card after we had already ordered our meal ... a big disappointment. and there was no attention given to adherence to covid precautions and rules concerning contact tracing. we were given one of the glasses of wine and the water for free, but really the evening was spoilt and the restaurant not at the level it should be given its prices and style. "
"foo was very good, but very little choice. we were warned on entering that the souschef was not available and that they have only a very small menu. but what they had was very good and as it was excellent weather we sat on the terras with a beautiful view."
"we had lunch at kasteel wittem... the quality of the food was superb and very tasty, however, we had to wait a long time before the waiter took our order (there was no-one to be seen on the terrace outside the castle). also, people who arrived after us, were served faster (and even got their drinks faster). a bit disappointing but the great food made up for it!"
"our food was amazing and totally worth the money. unfortunately the service wasnt at all. no menu in english and no effort to help us translate the menus, had to wait an eternity until we could order our food and in the end to pay. no one asked us if the food was good, no smile from the waitress. although we loved the food, the service had a bad aftertaste, not sure if i would recommend the restaurant.

"a friend an i went for dinner. the staff is friendly but the food was not not impressive. the taste of the steak was good.. but after chewing at it for a while my friend and i swapped the meat. his schnitzel was plain, fortunately with the garlic butter it had taste. when the question got asked how the food was i could say ok.. that thanks to the side dish(rhubarb with cherries) and the sauce. i would come again for a drink.. not for the food .. "
"food is ok especially sea food always fresh but not very imaginative menu. in itself not a bad thing but the prices are a bit too high for the quality of the menu. service is very variable and not consistent, friendly but not very professional especially in summer time. definitely a case of not to much competition around. been there several times in 3 periods in 2016. summer and winter"
"we got our starter, my bread was ice cold and so hard i nearly broke my teeth on it! then we waited 45 mins till we got our main meal! did they forget us? then when it did come my partners mussels/clams were mostly all still closed and further down the pan even cold! my meat was luke warm and the sauce cold. but the chips were hot! the lovely girl serving did take some drink off our bill, she was nice and helpful, but saying that..... we would not ever go back to this restaurant."
"youre ready to spend a bit more than the dinner value: food is good ambients nice but if youre hungry you might be disappointed by the portions. that being said, the bill well meets a meal which makes you asking for a doggy bag."
"dreadful espresso. apple pie had likely been frozen, anyway soppy and tasteless. would not recommend visiting this place."

we had lovely evening here with our family.we did find menu bit limited and most of us ended having burgers as not too much to choose from.friendly staff and very helpful.children enjoyed a swim in lake and play area popular.outside heaters on for diners wishing to eat outside.
"a nicely located restaurant where they serve a nice meal! went there recently and enjoyed the food and drinks we were served, however the service was mediocre. friendly, but not very professional. long waits, not addressing our wishes in regards to what was served when. apparently they understood this themselves as well as we were offered coffee on the house at the end of the evening to compensate this lack of attention."
"the place has style, the sea is a few meters away, you have outdoor tables but unfortunately the service it’s bad. i asked for a caesar salad with chicken. i started to eat and noticed that there were also slices of fish or sardines.i cant eat any seafood, i immediately stopped eating and my appetite was gone, the waitress approached her, i explained the situation very kindly and she really didnt care, she didnt take the plate away, she didnt apologize, she didnt ask me if i was allergic or treated to solve the problem, he only said ok maybe it’s problem with the kitchen and left, then i ordered two cocktails with the same waitress and when the runner arrived with the drinks he gave me a bottle of beer in which i indicated it was not correct. when i requested the bill the they never removed a bottle of beer and the salad from the bill, so check your bill well before paying for they only say the total amount that was supposedly consumed. i asked the waitress to remove the drink and plate of food from the bill. dont even tou "
"amazing location,and very busy on a good day,but overpriced with rude service,no customer satisfaction at all, if they cant handle how busy it gets then serve less,the food was blunt,burger overcooked, as long as customers do not say nothing they will not change anything, i will not be returning and i wonder why people cue up to get in this place !! i have to say drinks where okay though!!

"the weather was great, but still it was a rather unpleasant experience at aloha. perhaps it was a bad apple, but the service from one of the waiters was painful. grumpy, uncooperative and on the verge of what you could call rude. pay attention to the bill, as it could be different from what the menu says (not in your favor). burgers are meh, meat cooked well but the bun was pretty dry. will definitely not be coming back here!"

"great location, cute beachy interior but horrible service, i realize its a beach bar but we ordered a burger which when served was rare, asked politely if we could have it cooked a bit more, and were told thats how the burgers are served like it or no "
bio burger used to be the best burger you could get in wijk aan zee. now they dont serve them with wedges anymore and hard bread.
"we like the place but seriously, 1h15 to get 3 burgers and a salad, ordered at 6pm?  not ideal if like us you have children. staff was very friendly though and offered us drinks."
we had dinner in the fletcher restaurant. the waiters advized us to take the deer. the food tasted good but we wondered if it really was deer. it tasted more like a regular sirloin of a cow. nevertheless it was an enjoyable evening

this was the first time we had been here with friends who lived local. the service was ok when the food arrived we were disappointed. we felt the food could have been better for the price we paid. we were astonished to be charges 6 euros for tap water as in england it is free. there was also and overcharge of which our dutch friends discovered. it goes to say we will not visit again.

"food quality very poor. soggy spring rolls, gluggy dum-sum, beef dish prepared with deep-fried beef off-cuts. not really restaurant quality. servers also inattentive and unqualified.  terrible, disappointing experience all round."
"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "

"set in lovely surroundings this trattoria unfoortunately is simply average and given the final bill even overpriced. it has a a very average choice of items on the menu, all of course based on the italian cuisine. we selected a 4 course surprise menu but afterwards kind of regretted our choice: unspectacular grilled tuna, followed by an average pasta and mediocre steak. there seemed to be a lot more attractive items on the menu but we didnt taste those and hopefully they are prepared with more passion and ingenuity than what we were served. the staff is very kind though, perhaps a little popular, and the wines were really nic "

"its a nice looking restaurant which offers thai food. we tried two different chicken curries, sadly both of them were extremely dry. the flavoring of the dishes was good, but the dryness of the chicken ruined them. the staff was friendly but a bit slowly. this resulted in an average overall experience and not receiving value for money here."
"good choice if you are around arnhem/oosterbeek. the food is made with fresh and colorful ingredients. taste of food is pretty good, portions are small in size and dessert card is limited and overpriced."
"we hadnt planned on going to lemon grass, however, some business took us to oosterbeek and we happened to notice an advertisement we were reading while waiting for our appointment. our business contact recommended lemon grass as a good restaurant and so we went. we eat thai on a regular basis so we were anxious to find out about this restaurant. when we walked in around 18.00 hrs the place was empty and for a moment we started to get a bit worried. we noticed the reserved signs on every table and it didnt take long before the restaurant started to get pretty packed with other guests. lemon grass also do take-away by the way. we ordered a couple of dishes and they came very quickly (a bit too quickly actually for our liking...) and they all tasted very good. service was friendly and efficient. the restaurant itself is not particularly inspiring for a thai restaurant but okay. (i guess we have been spoiled by sombat in antwerp which is our favorite...) we couldnt finish all the food and the waitress was so kind to organise a doggy bag for us so we could continue to enjoy lemon grass at home. all in all we left satisfied and by that time, the restaurant was full. next time in oosterbeek, we would certainly consider to go back when in the mood for a good asian dinner."
"we had heard about this restaurant and were really excited to go there since more than a year. that was maybe our mistake, and therefore our disappointment was bigger. the food is good, average, but for the prices that they apply you would expect better quality. it might a matter of choice, maybe we did the wrong one for our dished, but when you pick the special of the chef, you expected something special....not something common. the first dish was good and presented in a special way, so that was nice, but for the rest it was not the best. we wont go again, because they are many other thai restaurant and this one just didnt attract us enough to go again."
"dining here was a spontaneous decision. i was served very well. as a vegetarian, i found enough things on the menu to make a meal: omelet, soya beans, seaweed salad, miso soup. i was sorry the place was so empty. i cant explain that! i hope business picks up and the restaurant can stay in town."
we selected this restaurant because it offered a different menu than what we usually find in the dutch restaurants in this region. it was also one of the few italian restaurants whose main menu item is not piz

"we order take away with a value of 72 euro`s. at home we opened our favourite dish, sha sieuw (no 122 on their list) we all smelled right away this dish was off. it smelled a bit sour. i informed them by phone immediately and they asked me to come by right away, but we (our family and guests) were all ready to eat. no apologies at this point. we agreed to come over after dinner. when we arrived, the female owner took the bag and she and the make owner were smelling it and even took a bite. when we asked them what their take was on this, she casually replied with, we are going to judge it. no apologies at this point. then she started to make a lot of assumptions, that we were probably didn’t want a new dish because we were already full. i explained to her that paying 72 euroand our favourite dish being off with guests at the table, took away our whole experience that sent the value of 72 euro very fast to the worst moment of the day. she offered the money back for the dish and gave me back 15 euro`s. at this point i really felt i was not heard at all and no empathy whatsoever, still no apologies. the male owner also joined the argument by saying that they and all four cooks ate the dish and it is the same as always. now we got into an argument, because the dish was clearly off. for me this is something that can happen and if they could admit that no problem, we will be back the next time, but this denying went a bit too far. i said come one this is not ok, if you deal with complaints like this i will never come back here. the male owner replied with, ok that is fine. i said no that is not fine at a "
"ate dinner for 2 here, food was ok (normal chinese food with nothing to be excited about). however with the prawn crackers we asked for a dipping sauce and found out that cost 3euro extra (without being told) and also a small pot of chinese tea was also 3euro (normally free in places i have been before). overall, reasonable food but ruined by expensive extras"
we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef i’ve had in the years i’ve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. i’ll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i don’t ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldn’t make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesn’t agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i don’t wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."

"service in this restaurant is extremely bad, after 20 mins no one came to take our order. surprisingly they have 4 waitresses with such service. finally one came after we waved for her. my husband ordered melted goat cheese, that must be a piece of bad cheese. it tasted moldy. i will never go there again !!"
"reading previous reviews is unfortunate.  we only came for drinks and snacks and were welcomed and received very nicely. good hospitality,nice beer and good service. cant say otherwise.  try for yourself and make your own judgement."
"went here without a reservation around 20:30 on a saturday evening. we asked for a table for dinner, but inside was fully packed. we were seated outside. the waiter came 1 min. later to tell us there was a table available. this table was a big one for 8/10 pax, but next to the toilets. a big downside were the aggressive flies around our food and drink "

"the restaurant is located just outside the city centre with a nice view from the terrace over the harbour. the restaurant is dark and the food is ok, but not special."
lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
first visit since the re-opening and we were not disappoint 
the buffet was split up to three different rooms and it was pretty confusing.  the prices were high for such disorganization and our drinks werent filled very often.
"the quality of the food was quite poor, the dessert was warm as it was standing outside of the fridge too long. there was no wine menu, house wine it is. even if you want to pay extra. there is a playroom for the kids what makes it ok. due to this low quality we expected low prices and that is not the case."
"there is a vast choice of food at this all you can eat buffet and we found it a little overwhelming. you would have thought a serve yourself buffet would be quite explanatory but we were confused from the offset. we followed the queue and took a plate. in front were various raw meats and vegetables (most were unfamiliar to us). seemingly you chose the combinations, took them to the chef and were offered a choice of sauces to cook it in. needless to say my combination tasted awful and my friends not much better. obviously we could have left our poor choice and tried another one but we dont waste food so put it down to bad choice and not the fault of the restaurant. the meal came to just over 50 euro for 2 meals and coff "
"service initially slow. my meal: mosterdsoep | zalm | stokbrood excellent. kalfsentrecote* | italiaanse klassieker | seranoham | seizoensgroenten | salieboter very poor due to high fat and gristle content. dessert average. did not receive an after dinnner despite this being ordered! another member of our group received her main course incorrectly, she was compensated by receiving a plates of french fries. in all honestly this is he first time ive experienced problems at this restaurant. it will be a long time before revisiting."
"i celebrated my birthday here with my family on a lovely summers evening on the outside terras. we all enjoyed our meal and the service was good. we also had the retiral reception for one of our employes in a recently available reception area and this was as we are used to from eetcafe 1837, friendly and attentive staff and tasty well prepared finger food. this is an all round establishment and i would recomend it for family occasions"

"when you choose to travel by car for a visit to tapas restaurant olijf, the multilevel car park boekenberg is especially suited for the purpose. the pedestrian way-out drops you right behind the restaurant and the parking fee is moderate. the web site of olijf contains this excellent advice. the restaurant is located in a historic building in the voorstraat, one of the streets that are left over from the old village spijkenisse. the atmosphere of the restaurant can be soothing, except that there were somewhat more flies in residence than you could wish in a restaurant with an open kitchen. later on the evening one fly decided to have a bath in my wine glass. brrr... furthermore, the somewhat irritating music over the speaker system clashed with the restaurant appointments. it is my opinion that music in shops or restaurants is mostly there for the pleasure of the staff, not for the customer. service of the staff was friendly, but mechanically. the dutch are not very good in hospitality and serving customers, not like italy, where hospitality and serving customers is an art. furthermore, our waitress omitted to bring clean plates for the main course; a grave mistake. it was also difficult to attract the attention of the staff. in the end it was impossible to get our bill presented to the table, so we decided to take our coats and ask for the bill at the counter. but how was the food then? olijf is a tapas restaurant, where you share with your table companion divers small portions, ordered from the menu. generally, the food was well prepared. sauces are to be avoided, they come out of a bottle. i must say the slices egg pancake with salmon and cream cheese filling were delicious and also the pork medallions with bacon wrapping were cooked perfectly. however, later on my digestion system told me that possibly the chef of olijf uses flavour enhancers in the preparation of the food. maybe salt msg. (also called ve-tsin in chinese restaurants). i may be wrong, but i am very sensitive for this additive. what shall i say about olijf. it can be a very nice restaurant when some easy improvements are made by the management. but they do something right. the restaurant was busy on this weekday and mostly with regular customers."
it is a good place with a fairly tasty food. tried tapas and it was fine. i didnt pay so i dont know the average per person. portions are not big so heavy eaters need to watch out.

we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
bland oriental food in enormous portions. the restaurant promises more than it really gives. the only aspect worth while discussing about is the average pricing.

"the service was great and the atmosphere good. i guess one should not expect exceptional food at a buffet restaurant, but i am still surprised at the very high rating other people give the restaurant. the quality of the food is good as a buffet goes, but cannot compete with a restaurant preparing individual meals to order. so if you want to eat huge quantities of average food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go to."
"overall good food, but as we went there, the place was crowded all the way and as a result, we had to wait in long queues, separated from each other, because almost everyone in our group wanted other types of fo "
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"

"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant

"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crème brulée with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"

30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"chicken satays were quite poor and nothing like proper thai satay. they appear to be deep fried……. the pad thai was pretty good (7 oo 10) although the large lettuce leaves are a needless addition and actually put me off a little - wilting lettuce…ugh. service was good. 40 euros pretty steep i thought (two beers plus starter and main). in west london, i go to thai bites which is 5 star and then some and for same meal i am about 25 pounds by comparison. probably lucky to not get two stars tbh."

"we have moved in to voorburg from amsterdam at about the same time that thai fresh was established. we had been to thailand a couple of times not long before we moved and it was our favored restaurant from the outset locally with its wide range of dishes, real thai complexity of taste, and great atmosphere. we went there several times a year for several years. about three years ago they have started to add more and more sugar to more and more dishes, often to the point where it muffled all other taste. in these last few years, dishes such as the tom yam koong, the tom kha kai and even the krapauw dishes have become unenjoyable as a result, at least for us. one of the few dishes that most recently seems to have escaped the sugar influx is the laap moe (which is still a gem). currently it is our recommendation to avoid any dish which contains coco milk or is labelled hot/spicy, there is simply too much sugar added to these to be able to experience the underlying taste, in our opini "

"first of all let me say that the 3-course meal was excellent, especially the starter with salmon... having said that, the restaurant apparently cannot handle several special deals occuring at the same time. we went here during restaurantweek, but had vouchers for another deal which was different from the one served as part of the restaurant week. we should have been given the choice of 3 dishes for all 3 courses of the meal, but instead we received the same 3-course menu that was part of the restaurant week deal. we mentioned this at the beginning, but were told it was the same. my husband looked up the conditions when we returned home, and not only were we right, they had also overcharged us for the restaurant week special they served us instead. we contacted the restaurant by e-mail about this, but havent received a reply so far. so, what to think... great food, but lousy service?"
"had dinner here with a larger group. the service was good but the menu and food was average, actually disappointing. the reason for the verdict was that the dishes were so bland."
"the restaurant looks good but thats about it. the ingredients were bland and boringly cooked. nothing impressive. pretentiously trying to be gourmet/fancy but the only thing they did was decrease the portions of a regular home-made meal. the service was very weak (they stored our coats in the kitchen because they didnt have space elsewhere, but didnt warn us about it, so it was with much surprise that we left the restaurant with our coats smelling of cooking!). would definitely not go there again."
"the food is great, but the service could be better in a more classy place like this. it is near the railway station of voorburg, so easy to reach."
"we were looking forward for a nice evening and were excited to dine in this high ranked restaurant. when we got there, we were greeted without any kindness, rather as if we were not welcome. when we were seated we got a little amus-bouche which waa very good, but we had to wait for the menu for at least 10 minutes and ask 3 times for a bottle of water. in my opinion, for a restaurant in this category, absolutely unacceptable. the lady that served the bread, which came in three different types, wasn’t really able to explain the difference and seemed more annoyed than willing to do her job or at least be friendly. i decided to go with the 4 course menu, the first course was lobster and mackerel which was good, but already a little disappointing, as the portion was really small and the sauce was too sour and i missed the light sweetness of the lobster, what makes it so special. the white wine we ordered, a light summer wine, had room temperature and just put on a small table next to us, so that we had to ask the service (several times) to put it in the refrigerator again. the quality of the food decreased from course to course, just like the service’s motivation to make an effort for us to have a pleasant evening. we then decided to forgo the desert and just stop this nonsense. the whole evening was a pure disappointment and absolutely not worth the money we spent there!! "
the food and the service are really good. but: when i left the restaurant i was still hungry and so was my (female) colleague. from a three course meal of round about 50 euros i think i can at least expect not to be hungry anymore.
"this was our third trip to villa la ruche. pleasant atmosphere and friendly, efficient service but the food was rather disappointing as was the case during our second visit last year. we ordered a 5 course surpise menu this time. the third dish with sweetbread and biff was very tasty and very appealing. the remaining dishes lacked character and taste. in addition, the lobster served in the second dish was partially raw. i doubt very much we will be going back."
"we walked in at 12noon as stated opening hours at the door and was asked if we wanted to dine in or take away. my reply was take away and the lady at the counter said they dont have that kind of chinese food and they target mainly the caucasians. well, my skin is yellow and so is hers! thanks for the heads up, we missed chinese food thats why we walked in and left with loss of appetite!"
"we have been here several times, always had a good experience. this time however, there was a different sushiman (due to holidays?), which unfortunately made for a very poor meal, not even matching all-you-can-eat-suahi quality....disappointing"
"although the food was good, will be very reluctant to return over the issue of providing tap water when asked. wed told the waiter we had biked (thirsty) and asked for tap water. we noticed a reluctance but were given two small, two thirds full glasses water. we also order sake to start with. when one of us asked for more tap water out came an already opened bottle of branded water. nothing was said that we had to have this and couldnt have more tap water. the other of us later asked for tap water, and again an opened bottle of branded water was put on the table, no explanation. the owner needs to understand that such things makes patrons not want to buy other drinks (at higher prices), although would have if tap water had been provided, nor buy extra food, nor return. so they really do miss out. and it leaves a bad feeling. not good practice."
i decided to give this restaurant a try since i stumbled upon a groupon for it and i thought why not! how wrong i was. 
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone. "
"living near voorburg gave me the opportunity to visit this restaurant with a former colleague. he mentioned i would not be disappointed and indeed even if it is nothing spectacular, we had a nice evening on the terrace under the s "
"nice and friendly reception, the starters were good and promising. unfortunately, the mains were disappointing. it was obviously not the best day for the cook. however, service was good."
located in the heart of historic voorburg this restaurant/bar is a good place to have dinner or just a drink (on the terrace). good service and food. also reasonably priced.
we came back here after a 2 yea 
"we had a great meal, but the service was slow. waited for drinks for more then 15min also a refill was taking very long. then next to us was a very loud table and when asking the waiter about it he just smiled and pulled up his shoulder "
"i was very excited to go this restaurant, after it was recommended by a friend, and booked it for my husbands birthday dinner. the location and setting is great. the restaurant also has a nice vibe to it and was full on a saturday night. unfortunately, it was clearly understaffed and understocked when it comes to fo "
"a great location and nice food, but that is what you expect in this price range. the service is friendly, but lacks professionalism. the menu and wine lists are rather short. we had an enjoyable evening, but i felt trapped in a concept (including fake flowers and an artificial smell)."
"even though the food was still tasteful, the overall experience was very disappointi "
"private parking, nice view in the restaura "
food was okay but not the price you have to pay for it.  wish the former chef stayed...... the service was average.
though it is nice to have this kind of restaurant in voorburg it does not distinguishes itself from restaurants of the same concept in neighbouringthe hague. theres a lot to choose from the menu but the dishes are a bit bland and do not wow you. overall it is just adequate. the price is okay and so is the service.
"it use to be good in the past, but not anymore, we went there many times but today was the last one. taste, quality and service are much more lower, also my daughter become sick once back at home! de sushimeisjes den haag is our new adress much better!!!"
"yes, all you can eat, but oh oh oh... sushi all tastes the same dish with beef was only curry and no beef to be found (and when we mentioned this to waiter he just said: yes, that is beef.).."
"the wosrt attention! the service is really slow, the waiter is arrogant and pedantic, and make you wait and wait for the food so you get full and dont eat much paying for at least 5 rounds."
"good tasting food. they offer all-you-can eat special on weekends. nice selection of alcoholic drinks. be aware they tend to miss a dish or two, if you order 5 or more in one go, especially during weekends."
this restaurant is a nice and good variation on the asian all you can eat concept. it is all about tapas. you can choose from cold and warm dishes. both meat and fish. veggies lovers will be dissapointed here. there is not much choice for them. though the mushrooms in garlic sauce are delicious! you can have cocktails for 5 euros but better order a bottle of wine or a can of sangria. the gambas and the fish dishes were that day exceptionally good. service is friendly and adequate. this is a fine restaurant to take your kids to.
"we like tapas and mezze a lot and eat them at home and outdoors in nl and many other countries. this restaurant has an all you can eat formula, with low quality - mostly fried- food, unexperienced staff and huge cocktails filled with soda. this is not dining, but stuffing yourself with carbs and fat! "
"the service was great. food was up and down, the dishes arent all the same size. therefore you didnt really know what to expect. they make you pay for everything that is leftover. would have loved to try more different dishes. the beenham was a bit dry. but the garnalen en kaas kroketjes were amazing! "
"sushi was really very average, but the yakitori and spring rolls were good. ordered a carafe of still water for my girls, only to be told later by a second waiter that they dont do that (?), and i had to order a bottle instead. later saw it was 6 eur which is a bit of a needless rip-o "
restaurant was very busy with not many staff as it was kings day would have like more snacky things on the menu
"the current fusion menu is less interesting, for example you cannot find a real japanese soup, i could only get something with chicken bits and cream. forget about the exquisites dessert you had earlier, like sesam ice-cream"
"this dining experience was the worst ive ever had. the wait staff completely ignored me, i had to call them over to bring my menu and then again to order my meal. after waiting 40 minutes i asked them where my food was and they rushed to give it to me. it was gross. the miso soup was so salty i couldnt eat it, even after i tried watering it down. the seaweed salad was too thick and not seasoned properly. the california roll didnt taste like it had crab, it tasted like tuna fish from a can. it was awful, there is nothing good i can say about this experience. if they offered to pay me $50 to come back and dine there again i would decline, it was that bad. i wish i could give this less than one star, this place has no business calling it a japanese restaurant."
this is a hotel bar that started serving sushi a few years ago. ive only visited ad a guest of the hote 
"we actually ordered sushi for take out. it was okay sushi and the staff who helped us was okay as well. in this area there is not a lot of choice, think they want to be a bit to fancy."
"we ate in this restaurant twice and on both occasions the food was glorious however was badly let down by the service which was touch and go. the staff were very attentive to begin with but then seemed to lose interest in what little diners they had, perhaps it would be better if the hotel had a separate bar instead of using ozzo as one."
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasn’t a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anyway… waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"we booked a dinner with my husband and my son, sold as live cooking buffet... its just another of those all you can way place with a very large variety of food where you can eat everything but the quality isnt for sure something remarkable."
we had dinner here with our fami 
"the lunch menu was a bit boring. i had a beef carpaccio, which was reasonably executed, but the portion of bread was very small. service was ok, but a bit slow seeing at they seemed to have 6 serving staff. i wouldnt go again as there are better options in the area."
the drink arrived when we had already finished the appetizers and i had to ask for the napkins twice after the first course. fairly good dishes but with definitely not involving combinatio 
"evening meal with colleagues, menu choice is limited and service is ok but not quick..... you have to make sure that you grab the attention of the waiter otherwise you will sit there all evening being ignored potentially. food quality is good...."
"if you came here as part of a keukenhof coach tour or wedding festivity, both happening during our meal you probable be quite happy but we came to meet with family to chat and relax. both food and wine menu ok. i had carpaccio to start, dutch lamb with white asparagus (in season) for mains and good selection of cheese for desert. considering price level service was patchy and not out waitresses fault just overloaded - 3 requests for wine list and having to wait for water glasses to return from washer before we could have some. nothing especially local about the experience. "
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chef’s cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
this place is perfectly located on the beach and there is a large parking place on the other side of the dune 
it was a nice afternoon and we had been cycling so wanted to stop and have something to dri 
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"we had dinner at this restaurant with a large group. luckely we had a reservation, the place was packed with tourists, which gave it a nice holiday ambiance. we ordered different kind of dishes (meat/ fish/ kids etc) the starters were served within 30 min and a 45 min later the main meal was serve "
i didnt expect these tastes..i didnt like it at all..i dont know what happened..the last time i visited the restaurant was before two years and all the plates was amazing and could pass by my esophagus but unfortunately this time i have only to say the worse with lots of water..
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
"good place, friendly staff, quick service. food is of the quality you should expe "
"pretty much as all the other japanese restaurants i have eaten in the netherlands. quick service, nice environment, nice shrimps and musse "
this place is where you should have your pre-cinema meal. they serve a wide range of asian tapas which satisfies your need for instant food while having only 45 before the movie. price is right too..
"after a visit to the adjacent cinema we decided to try azuma. i myself am not so fond of sushi, however, they have non japanese dishes too. the restaurant has an all you can eat concept for 25 euros during a maximum of 2,5 hrs. according to my wife, the sushi was good. i tried different other asian dishes which were good as well. service was swift and friendly. major draw-back though is the frying smell throughout the place so when leaving the restaurant we were very happy we didnt have anything else planned and our cloths went into the washing machine straight away upon arriving home. okay for once but would probably not return."
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"i will not be returning there, which in itself says something..after schlepping yourself upstairs (i have asthma but the elevator is only for freight and... invalids only with companion. the food is very average, cooks do their work with little interest. the only active one was a young waiter that removed your plate and empties at the speed of light. for icecream you get a minuscule cup and a revolving counter which you are not allowed to use yourself so you have to wait until someone shows up to serve you at 2 scoops max.. it simply does not feel very hospitable.as a plus i will say that the place is very clean."
it is a pretty large place up the stairs. catering to bigger groups eating there while on a business event with bowling in the cellar. the food is ppentiful and okay quality.
we visited this restaurant with colleagues. the quality was ok but not very special for a japanese restaurant. it is an all you can eat restaurant with also general asian food. the location is easy to reach close to the a27 highway. good parking.
"decent and fresh food, ideal for families. self service formula with on the fly teppan yaki and good chinese cooks that swiftly make your fresh chosen ingredients."
"its a nice concept and in general is a nice family restaurant. but in temrs of the quality of the food, the price is too high. it wasnt a bad experience but i would not go back."
"huge chinese/asian/japanese kind of foodhal, all you can eat concept so bring an appetite. do it yourself means gathering your food and let the cook boil it (wok or teppanya "
ok they have teppanyaki besides the wok. sushi choice is minimal. service average. for people who can eat a lot its nice value for money
"this restaurant has a typical chinese/japanese/asian wok restaurant. there are different stations of buffet which are devided not only for starters, main menus and desserts but also cook or uncook main menu. for 1 price you can eat all you can, but you still need to pay for your drin "
"good food, nice people, but no respect for any covid-19 measure. no 1.5m distance between tables, no masks, no qr  check, nothing. a true insult to the public and other restaurants who do respect the guidelines."
"my family-in-law goes here all the time apparently. they are not foodies. the decor of this restaurant looks beautiful. but its kind of restaurant with an identity crisis. is it italian, or greek? cause they are known to be italian (in my family-in-law at least), but really the menu is greek, with also one dish of risotto (which then makes it italian-greek?). food is a lot and greasy. not very satisfying. i liked the tzatiki and pita bread, but thats really all i liked. "
nothing to get excited about. pretty good quality mediterranean meals. the staff are very friendly and welcoming.
"we went out for a family dinner to this restaurant. while the welcome was very friendly and warm and the staff and the manager very friendly we were disappointed in the delays in serving our food. the presentation of the food was super but it took way too long for our food to be served and when it finally did get served it was almost cold. that spoilt everything! my husband expressed his disappointments directly to the manager so we hope that the next time we go there, if we do, the serving of the food is well improved!"
we went to plein 22 for a quick dinner on a friday nig 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"this is the worst asian restaurant that since we moved here 2 years ago. we were around houten and checked an asian place to have lunch. ming en ming came out with good reviews at tripadvisor which i am very surprised .it was 12.15 and the restaurant was totally empty , no reservation signs on the tables and the waitress showed us the worst place to sit :) darkest table next to the kitchen. when i asked to sit around i sensed she didnt like it but we sat anyway . we got open buffet kind 18.50 euros round menu which i defiantly do not recommend . we could not find anything to order .it was too much for the poor quality . never again."
followed my own advice from nov2016 and skipped the grilled items.   got #62 rice noodles with curry (singapore noodles) again and it was excellent.  #134 california roll and #67 chicken stir fried noodles were just ok.
my grilled items ribs and chicken satay had zero caramelization and were very poor.  the stir fried dish and side noodle dishes were excellent.   service was good.
food was ok but wirh very slow and cold service attitude. the food was ok but the cold 2 service attitude make us feel very unfriendly :(
they are true believers in mayonaise. mayo on my salmon. mayo on the broccoli. mayo covering my plate. mayo mayo mayo. kids menu is a gloried snackbar offering. my pasta looked sad and was crying for help and respect.

"the breakfast is in the average. a good choice of sweet and salt, and the quality is also in the averag "
"i have been here quite a fee times recently for business meetings, and the uitsmijter i had for lunch was the worst i had ever had. apart from that the service is appalling, every single time i have to get up and find a waiter to pay the bill, and then they have to find the waiter that served us to take payment, so that takes about 10 minutes waiting around. not impressed!"
"great breakfast buffet lots of choice and fine quality of products. dinner very big portions not so high qualit, i would prefer smaller portions and improved ingridients"
"we ate at van der valk houten on our way to the theatre in utrecht. the ambiance is quite impressive. we arrived rather early and service was attentative at that point in time. when it became busier, it started to slip away. when we got the sole that we ordered and which was cut by the staff, it turned out it had not been cooked well enough. when the bill came, i had the impression that it was more expensive than what i am used to and would expect from a van der valk. all in all, not bad but not impressive either."
"we were in this restaurant business wise and before the meeting we wanted to have a dinner. the menu is still elaborate with trendy looking dishes and names. the service is rather poor with students with no hospitality experience. the dished served consist of the fish or meat with ample serving of french fries. the fish dish ( vissers palet) was a variety of fishes mainly too salty pangasius fillet, scallops etc. with some rather poor looking garniture. for business ok but not a place to have a special occasion"
"we went out for drinks and then dinner here. drinks outside were great, but the dinner after was, well, a ridiculously long wait. and then they were not able to serve as at approximately the same time, so when the first few people had finished their food, the next would receive their food, and there were 3 rounds like that for 12 people. they should have just told us they cant cope with groups!the food was fine but bad experience. "
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (‚revenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"very disappointing diner. 4 meals were not ok. too basic and fish was definitely not fresh. when talking to the staf in a friendly way, the waiter became quite defensive and claimed every day they fresh ingredients."
"located between driebergen and doorn, the restaurant is favoured by my wife because of the beautiful out door seating in their well maintained garden. the food can vary widely from fabulous to not so nice, but in general the flavours, presentation and quality are better than avera "
"the restaurant looks nice, both garden and inside. the card promises much but judging by the little we ate, not really . we arrived at 19.30 a monday night, restaurant not even half full. three persons serving. two young girls and a gentleman that seemed to be the boss, only him took the bills. both the girls and the man disorganized, going around without paying attention to guests or having their own agenda, unknown . we sat at a table for two, just one napkin on the table. this was disregarded but we were asked at once what we wanted to drink. the waitress seemed to think that people should just drink wine by glass, seemed very astonished when my husband said that it is possible we order a bottle. she asked if we wanted merlot or pinot noir.... a little tired by the exchange we ordered two glasses of merlot, very average, and very little quantity. then we were left to linger over our wine about 20-30 min, our desperate tries to get some attention were cut short by the gentleman who plonked on our table two small rolls of serrano ham with goat cheese, and told us that we will get the menus but first eat this. a napkin for my husband was provided. the menus arrived by and by. i ordered a veal broth and a fish cooked in the oven sicilian style and my husband a ravioli and red fish(?) fried. after about 30 min our staters arrived. mediocre food, looked better than it tasted. and now our glasses were empty, we managed by and by to get some attention and another two glasses of red wine. and then another wait ....till 21.30 h when we were fed up and asked for the bill as we could not wait any longer. our empty dishes were still on the table...we paid a bill of 81€ for 4 small glasses of wine and two starters, one was noted on the menu 6,75€ , the other was about 10€. do not go to this restaurant, the lack of professionalism and the lack of shame in asking full price for an order that was delivered only half is unbelievable."
the location is along the main street of doorn. we did take away but we should wait for a while as there was a long queue of people who also did take away. it seems that this restaurant is popular by the local.
"you get a list/menu and you can choose 5 snack size items, 5 times. you have to finish what you order. lots of choice, chinese and sushi. we really enjoyed this."
"this restaurant serves as the only chinese food restaurant in the neighborhood. since decades chinese restaurants in the netherlands have developed a taste that suits the dutch well. this restaurant understands this tradition well. the babi pangang is as it has to be. the take away service is good, friendly and quick. ordering by phone is possible and works well. service in the restaurant is friendly. the place is friendly for children. half portions are available."
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
"frozen pizza, shameful for a restaurant called italian. glass of water that costs 2.10 euros ... run away !"
"have been  a regular here for years. the house pizza is a favourite. other dishes, all italian cuisine, are at least satisfactory or good. the house wine is plonk, but service and atmosphere compensate for that."
"the restaurant/brasserie is a bit difficult to find, and you have to know it. it is the end of the road past de zandafgraving. so you do need some kind of own transport to get there (or walk). it is located on the top of the hill, near a small scale holiday pa "
"this restaurant is generally speaking excellent. i was very impressed in the past (before i was diagnosed with food allergies) by the creativity of the chef and great service, i would highly recommend it unless you have food allergies. i am gluten and lactose intolerant and thought they made good food for me, they served me cheap dry bread while my husband got an amazing freshly baked bread. my heart dropped, it did not seem like they were fair or well prepared. it was tolerated until dessert when again they served more options to my husband and i got a lame one with some dry almost burnt puffed rice to decorate the dish…..sorry, this does not fit the level of the restaurant. the cooks should be better prepared for fair options to people with intolerances, i reserved with details on my allergies and they did not deliver."
had dinner in this former brasserie. over the years the restaurant has really upgraded to fine dining restaurant. the service is professional and kind. the food is excellent and of high qualit 
"tasty food, many small dishes. the good tempranillo was a little expensive though. friendly people, service with a smile!"
you know instantaneously when you’re in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteur’s admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."
"amis restaurant is a lovely, quaint place to have dinner with business partners, friends and/or family. staf was friendly, helpful, and we had a nice ti "
"so all in all, right to the point here, this was once upon a time a good restaurant, a great one ev "
this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the ’smells’ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
"enjoyed a sit down dinner with fixed menu. it actually was good, but for the price paid, it was average. at this price point one would expect something much more refined and elaborate. the hfslg used to have one (from 1981 to 1986 even two) michelin stars, but this was lost in 2018. unfortunately for them, the very good meal that we had was indeed short of a michelin star worth meal. nevertheless, one can get an honest meal and the service is good, albeit slow."
"a beautiful restaurant, excellent service, but the quality of the food was disappointing. we regularly visiting michelin star restaurants in holland, germany, france, spain and japan, but the hoefslag is close to lose their star, as the food, the most important, was below the expectations. no dish was spectacular, a bit without fantasy, no 1 star michelin worth."
"have had dinner at the hoefslag several times the last year. it has been a top-class restaurant for very long. however, i was rather disappointed in the culinair experience. sure when you arrive you are received very courteously, the service is good, but never becomes personal, all more a routine then heartfe "
"after an absence of seven (!) years we - finally - revisited de hoefslag where we were married in a civil ceremony in 2008. so we were full of nostalgia and expectations, looking forward to a similarly sublime evening as way back when. our first impression was that not much had changed over the years; roughly the same decor and furnishings. this could have been reassuring albeit that it had all become rather shabby over time. one single bouquet of flowers unfortunately could not create an inviting ambiance on its own, especially when the view from the terrace includes a humongous, black pizza ov "
"we took our 13 year old granddaughter for dinner in the garden of bistro de ruif. nice setting for a warm evening, competent service, well prepared dishes. however, we were astonished- and more than a little put out- by the fact that we were charged 2 x €6 for 2 bottles of house (flat) water , i.e. tap water that is filtered in house (just like the water we drink at home). this is, in our view, unacceptable for restaurant where prices are already on the high side. the wine list is good, but expensive. when one spends €45 on a bottle of wine, one does not expect to have to spend another €12 on water! i dont think well go back."
"typical mid-priced dutch fare. overly salty, no imagination, unseasonal ingredients (i.e asparagus in october). very unhealthy kids’ meals options."
"have not been there for years.woken up after a long sleep (to put it mildly) used to be classy indonesian, now trying to recover"
"the location is nice, we ordered the most eleborate menu. it was not bad at all. i actually missed a dish containing fish. service was a bit distant. it took quite a long time before we were allowed to order. there was a little quarrel about my coat, when i left. nothing big, but i did nog feel myself appreciated as a guest, did not feel the hospitality you should expect."
"anak depok has for many years been a steady fortress of refined indonesian cuisine. we still like to visit this restaurant to illustrate the difference from the usual toko-fare. prices have gone up through the years and, when visiting with a family, the bill can reach impressive heigh "
"we had the 5 course surprise menu which included small dishes: one salad, one soup, one apetiser, one main and dessert. they were all okey but not all of them tasty enough in my opinion. the prices are good, the service is friendly but if you dont visit this restaurant, there is nothing you are missing."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so don’t plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
"it is a very crowdy restaurant with very great choice of food. there is something for everyone! teppan yaki, wok, hot and cold food buffet, tradional dutch as well as french, oriental and european. the dessertbuffet is awesome. drinks are included in the fixed price."
"even for a wok restaurant, that on average is not the most romantic place to go, this is close to a canteen. actually, ive seen this in china and there it may be acceptable. but this is not china. i expect a bit more. even for a w "
ive eaten here many times when staying at the ibis. there arent a lot of options in the neighbourho 
the restaurant was packed out on the night i was here. none -the-less the food was great. drinks could have come a little faster but seeing as they had a shortage of staff that night i cant complain. would go again. it is a good price/ quality split. enjoyed it.
they have an all you can eat concept.  good food for a reasonable price. no real specialties in the card . common but good!
the food was good and tasty. we would have rated this restaurant 5 but they refused to serve us tap water. every other restaurant we visited in the netherlands was happy to give us tap water with our meal. they charged an extortionate amount for a tiny bottle of still water. its a shame - this let the restaurant down. 
a fine way to do japanese but the food is very salty and the fried tempura type food is a bit greasy.
this restaurant and bar looks more like an irish pub. drinks are good. staff nice. food is nothing special. the steak was basic and not tasty. hamburger looks great but test is ordinary. prices high. nice outside seating. a lot of other restaurants around.
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "
had dinner here with my wife and our 2-year-old daughter. stayed in the hotel (separate review 
"for me it is a bit of been there , done th "
"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
"frankly a disappointing dinner,with our original reservation of table outside ,being rejected “ because it is friday night”. it is so hard to know how difficult covid makes matters,but in july 2020 this was at least open,clean and safe. hopefully standards will improve with experience."
"while asked the reception to turn on the heating in my room in the morning before my arrival, it was freezing in it when i arrived in the evening. since the heating system is more like a hair dryer on steroids as it jus blows out warm air of it, the room never became comfortably warm over night. and having the heating system blow air during the night wasnt a great thing either given the noise it created. bottom line: avoid the place if you are looking for a warm room during winter seas "
the chicken meal i had was delicious.  the beef soup was ok.  the sliced ham appetizer is a little squishy for my taste.  the shrimp appetizer was good.  nice views out of the window if you sit by them.
the hotel is located in the woods around the city. the beds are good and the rooms clean. only the price is a bit high and the restaurant is expensive.
"food was unpleasant and would not recommend.  english menu was very limited, you are not able to get the specials in english."
"we had planned to eat in rijssen itself, however after a heavy week and then a bracing walk in the surrounding woods we decided, after a quick look at the menu to eat in the hot "
great location and nicely done restaurant. friendly staff. food is a bit ordinary though and therefore too expensive for what it is. a great spot for a coffee or drink without the hefty price tag for the food.
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i don’t know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the table….. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . i’ve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
went here on a fridaynight after shopping for the holida 
"nice restaurant with good food. it want to be an upscale restaurant, but it isnt. the portions are small and the menu is not that great. choose for wonders or the other places nearby"
due to restaurant week rating we had dinner at restaurant. we dont understand the high ranking of the restaurant week because of the average quality of the main course.  nevertheless the service was outstanding and enthusiastic! conclusion: normal dinner with good price quality
"stroming is located at a nice spot in the shopping mall of heerhugowaard. it is a nice restaurant where many locals come to have diner. we had diner with friends and we picked this location because of a past experience. this time we were much less enthusiastic about the food. we sent a diet list way upfront to the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate that diet and of course they could. however, the implementation was awful and full of mistakes. between starter (which had some obvious mistakes) and main course i asked politely if they could pay a bit more attention to the diet of one of the guests. well they didnt. although the servants were friendly it cannot compensate the chefs ignorance. for the other people the food was kind of ok but not exceptional. the portions are rather small."
"quite a good meal, but having spent about 40 euros on 4 food items, a tea and a coffee, we asked for a cup of hot water, they refused. very stingy."
"we liked the menu and found the food of good quality. however, service was very slow even though it was not very busy. staff is friendly but does not seem to realize that they are there to serve customers. we had a nice table by the window and the interior is ok. but i can image if the restaurant is really busy you could probably listen in on the conversations at the table next to you. i would say that our overall experience is good."
"although we had made a reservation the booking wasn’t found. food mediocre, wine expensive, table too small, staff friendly. not worth a second try."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go. "
"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. it’s at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say “ignore visiting” and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and don’t bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so don’t mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
the food were yummy as always but had to repeatedly remind for all the items. unexpected rude behaviour by the staff these time around.
"we had a business lunch appointment and checked into this place without much further ado... had some great ham and eggs, with cheese on top -- not bad at all, some coffees and enjoyed the seaview on a windy and bit rainy day. that is all. there are 3 other beach bar/restaurants to choose from, we often prefer club zand to the others. but zeezicht is an average place. no surprises..."
"attracted by the nice location we had diner. the idea, as the waiter explained, is kind of a table dhote concept with changing menus every week. the food was ok, unfortunately the service quit poor. loads of dirty glasses and dishes remained on table, water was hard to find and orders were mixed up ( there were only 4 tables to be served "
"a lovely location and a great building - an old youth hostel - has a good menu. however, the experience was tarnished by poor service; delays and wrong orders."
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosé disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didn’t have to fill in our details) they didn’t clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and it’s sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here 😉
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the saté meat was very d

location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
we are very disappointed with the service. the chinese lady taking orders by the counter was rude & unfriendly. we do not understand why her attitude was very unwelcoming & she obviously looked annoyed when we wanted to make a reservation. it made us feel very unwelcome.
"no direct critique on my last visit to jasmin garden, but more in general. has the quality of chinese/indonesian food gone down significantly over the last decade or so? its been a while since ive ordered an indonesian/chinese rijsttafel. in this particular instance one for 4 people. i felt bad for my relatives who payed for it. it was like walking down a supermarket aisle. price the same, but less in the package or, in our case less dishes on the tabl "
chose this place because of the good reviews and because we are still expecting to eat chinese in a chinese restaurant somewhere in holland that is not chinatown (stupid expectation). we had no reservation and asked for a table for 2 and after a short wait we were taken to our tabl 
"for me it was the second time having dinner at this restaurant. what a difference with my first visit. it was known to the restaurant that we were there (7 guests) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. not one word was mentioned. the staff was clumsy with the wine and with serving after dinner tea. the owner/host never came to our table to ask if everything was okay. (this has been mentioned before in the lekker 500 magazine). the food was as it should be, but service and hospitality was disappointing."
"we have not been at apicius for a couple of years; a recent action draw our intention. however our renewed experience was not a favorable one: the hostess was quite clumsy (on our request if we could park a car nearby without being fined she answered: actually i dont know but you will find out sooner or later), the (excellent) white wine, was presented at room temperature instead of cooled, when we asked for some adjustments in the menu, this was received in a way that made us feel uncomfortable, without subsequent communication; the menu was fair, but not excellent or even creative; the beans tasted as if they came from the freezer instead of fre "
"the menu sounded very good but we found the food had no wow factor you expect from a restaurant with michelin stars. the atmosphere was poor, too many tables too close. i had a flower display taking up half my table placing that was imitation. not something i expect with fine dining. the whole restaurant needs updating, its cold with no atmosphe "
"only went once, but it was over-rated as far as we were concerned.  food was ok, service ok, but nothing special."
"based on reviews and hearsay we decided to give this trattoria a try. i must say we had a very pleasant evening. the ambiance and the service is more then ok a very friendly and helpfull staff. as for the food i have some remarks. yes everything tasted fine (not spectacular), portion sizes where ok, but in comparison with the prices asked it did not fit the picture completely. when getting a vitello tonato for € 13,50 i expect more, same goes for the grilled fish platter for € 26,50 a person. as said, we did have a nice evening, but at this price level i expect to be more surprised whit what is coming out of the kitchen. will i go back, i think yes, i would like to give it another try with different dishes, hopefully that can change my mind."
innesto has a nice a outside setting making it a good summer choice. i was not hugely impressed with the actual food however the menu is attractive and the service is good.
this is a very large buffet restaurant just off the centre of asten. it is on two levels as it has a mezzanine floor overlooking the main food counters. wouldnt recommend walking up and down stairs to get your food. stick to the ground floor. the selection is pretty much what you would expect of one of these places with a pretty good choice. the wine/beer/soft drinks are all included in the price of 26.50 e pp for a saturday night. there were a lot of children running around so obviously dutch parents dont have much control. there is a 2 hour time limit but if you cant have a meal in 2 hours something is wrong. no service as such its all self service.
"if the chef’s wife is the hostess i would divorce her. he has a goldmine in his hand without het . food is gold, service with her is lead."
"last year, i visited this restaurant that had just opened and was surprised by the different tastes and menu offerings of this asian fusion restaurant. this year’s visit was a bit of a disappointment. this restaurant has lost touch and steam in taste and quality of dishes. different beef dishes all suffer from the dame salty soy sauce taste, almost like with help if industrial taste improvers like dressing and sauces you can bit in the supermarkt. the dragon sushis’s rice was too loosely rollend and fell apart while picking it up, suffering from a pile of potatoe straw that took away all taste of the sushi’s fillings. no lemon grass taste in the lemon grass skewers, only soy sauce taste. it seemed if the restaurant had changed the ingredients: thicker rice rolls on the sushi and fewer fine ingredients. no innovation in the menu at all since a year ago, takes away the surprise. flat tastes in general, while the asian fusion concept has all the opportunities to offer more variety in tastes: more spicy offerings, more lemon tastes, less dominance of standard salty soy sauce tastes. strong used cooking oil odour inside the whole restaurant dominating the place, makes you wonder if they change the oil often enough and spare you the cancerous effects of overused cooking oil. so the dishes and tastes have become less distinguished and different, smaller and fewer high end ingredients, flat tastes in general. staff a bit stressed because of the e or ours amount of delivery orders. we felt that guests in the restaurants now need to wait more and suffer from flatter tastes and one size fits all foods because of the uptake of the deliveries. should not be this way. last year i wrote it was worthwhile to drive extra miles to experience this restaurant, but the brilliance has gone and kaizen is now more of a standard stand village restaurant, it is becoming just an other chinese with slightly different dishes in a sharing bites concept. it has downgraded itself. very good coffee, nice staff. it is obvious that the villagers go for delivery orders and that that the physical restaurant probably cannot compete with delivery meals where people accept less sophisticated tastes. it would be good if the physical restaurant offered something extra and not only a table for the same food."
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"het lieve leven serves rather good food, but the ambiance is very, very chilly. it starts already with the table reservation: the girl answering the phone is not really interested, just answers ok. decoration is rather basic: dark floor, no curtains, overlooking the highway. it all feels very chilly. fortunately i had a bussiness dinner, but as a couple i would never go there; a refrigareator has more atmosphe "
"we went to jatapasu for my 40th birthday meal with my small family. the initial host to seat us was very friendly. the concept is a you can eat, no limits to rounds or amount "
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"stayed at the hotel for several days. the food was delicious and presented very elegantly with nice choices on both the a la carte and on the 3-5 course chef options. however, the service speed was painfully slow and wait staff seemed inexperienced and leaderless. restaurant was not busy with lots of empty tables but still was very slow taking orders and dinner took 3 hours+."
"dinner in a chateau. who doesnt want that experience. we had dinner at this hotel/restaurant. we choose the chef menu but decided to have three courses. after the amuse, which was nice, we had the sashimi of tuna. nice but a little overwhelming with different tastes. after the sashimi we had the trio of beef. a carpaccio, a filet americain and a tartare. very nice but the sizes were big. after the second course we had the livar (pork) and the cod. the cod was slicly overcooked and the livar dry. having higher expectations in advance voor the level if the restaurant, we were slightly disappointed. the service was very friendly and always willing to explain the course or the wi "
"we came as a business group (guests of the hotel château holtmühle) for a dinner after a long and exhausting day, rather hungry. the restaurant was somewhat busy, but it does not explain extremely slow service. it took us something around three hours to get food served. the food itself was nice, yet the whole joy was spoiled by the pace it was served. one doesnt expect two minutes of eating (degustation menu du chef - five small courses) and half an hour waiting for the next course. absolutely unacceptable. we regretted we did not dine at macdonalds that night."
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"definitely a place to avoid. food is expensive and of average quality. service is mediocre and staff, especially the owners, are arrogant. when we visited, the sewer system left a distinctive smell but the staff wasn’t bothered to reac "
"people make mistakes....such as bringing my main course before you bring me the starter i ordered? it went down hill from there. when we finally received our main courses, my husbands was piping hot; mine however was luke warm at best. i should have complained at that point. however, i was tired, it was late and it had been a long da "
"after visiting multiple italian restaurants in the neighbourhood i can state that this place is a pizzeria and not a restaurant. pizzas were ok, nothing special and the wine was average. furthermore, the place lacked atmosphe "
"the pizza on your plate is very good, tasty, crisp bottom, but the surroundings do not improve the experience. the sound of people talking buzzes around in the area. if there are groups/tables with a larger number of clients that order at the same time, the kitchen can not cope with it. the waitresses could have a better feeling if you need e.g. a new drink by walking around in stead of grouping near the counter."
"food was over cooked, waitress was rude, dirty glasses and the list goes on. must be the worst restaurant i have been too"
"visited the greek restaurant santorini this evening. i wrote this review immediately when i came back home because i was really disappointed. it was the second time i came there (the first time was ok), this was terrible. the food was not bad although we had to wait for it a long time (more than 20 min.) but the service was really bad. we had to speak up to the waitress before she came to our table so we could tell her our coffee was watery and cold. she gave us a look as if we personally insulted her. the second coffee was still watery but hot (microwave?). i give the food a 7, service a 3."
we didnt stay a night at this romantic white castle but we did took a walk in the castle area. there is a walking route map in front of the castle by the parking area. its a beautiful castle to see.
"this could be such a lovely place to go to, but the staff just ruin everything. your drinks take ages to arrive simply rude in asking what your roomnumber is during breakfast. and the rooms are very basic. its good to sleep and the fact i have nt rated it poor is because its located in a beautiful surrounding (especially in the morning with the fog) "
"we stayed two nights in the hotel. the restaurant is convenient as there is nothing nearby unles you take your car. there is al limited choice and the menu is all right fot once but not for a second time as the choice is too limited. when busy the meat can be too far gone, juicy becomes more than medium."
"food is ok, nothing special. service personell is friendly. this is more like a fastfood restaurant. we tried the gyros dish, it was ok, but could probably need some more spices."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
i had a decent italian meal..fro. the portion to the taste it was pure italian. the service was quick and friendly. good view in the calm vaals..and they do home delivery
"we stayed for 1 night in hotel bilderberg. their restaurant was full so we had to look for something else. we went to della mamma. nice cousy italian restaurant. the staff is very friendly. we ordered carpaccio and pasta. all was good. if you look more for a fancy italian then this is not the place, but for pizza, pasta nice cousy place it is."
"not a bad pizza for dutch standards, but clearly no wood fired stone oven stuff. tiramisu was quick good. nice garden seating at the back. service was ok."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"i am handicapped and asked for a table were i am more or less protected. but this they did not have, it was busy, understandable. on my question: ‘ if you make reservation is it than possible to have a table out of the busy part of the restaurant. the answer was no, we have no attention for this, it is better if you go to a less busy restaurant. i was flabbergasted, but thought oké. good food here, but if handicapped you are not welcome here. we went to the village of vijlen where we ate in cuba libre, which was a good experience. "
"the food was terrible, heaten up in a microwave. i never have eaten such a tastless mousaka in my life. watery and the calamaris was rubbery. cheap squidrings would be better then this. only the dry white wine was good. it was packed and bums on seats policy. never go again to this  greek restaurant."
"great greek food, but very noisy and crowded with little children running and screaming. cant eat your dish calmly"
i was looking forward to a nice date evening with my husband but i didnt like the restauran 
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"food is average or even below average. way too crowded, so nobody could keep an appropriate distance. overall very disappointing."
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. won’t be returning here soon."
"we came to celbrate y mothers 85th birthday on a saturday evening with a group of eleven familymembers. we were welcomed in a proper way, the restaurant is a cozy, though rather big room with many tables, also for larger groups and the service to order was rather adequat "
"nijkerk is a city close to amersfoort and has a number of restaurants situated in the centre.this restaurant is a 10 minutes walk from there, has a large terrace on the corn "
"compared to its fame in the area, the prices are moderate and the food is good to excelle "
what was supposed to be a nice dinner turned into something hilariou 
what a weird experience we had 
was pretty okay for a classic all you can eat sushi. didnt really maintain consistent quality and the price was relatively high. but overall decent quality and atmosphere
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didn’t seem to care. won’t be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"food was ok but not thai, wines were great but staff had no idea about the wines, i was actually told that the viognier was a dessert wine????"
very average and extremely overpriced asian food. the warm food was served almost cold and meat quality and cooking techniques for high end asian food (which is what this place is trying to be) where very poor. paying a high price for poor quality food never feels oka 
"great ambiance, nice restaurant, food is good, good wines by the glass! point of improvement: staff is very friendly but need to become more efficient, waiting for a aperitif for 20 minutes and after the starter waiting for 35 minutes for the main course seems a bit too long, anyway will return in a couple of months!"
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"
"this restaurant is located nicely in the forest of veluwe, a very popular destination on a sunny summer day. it has an outdoor place t "
not good sushi. expensive way to eat and drinks are expensive. far too expensive for the quality. wont be visiting again.
"food was of decent quality, enough  quantity and not expensive.  personnel was pretty fast and kind. decoration was nice too."
"the food is good, however not very special. service is also good. it can be a littly noisy, due to the accoustic, so be aware where your gonna sit."
waiting time too long. starter was just a sort of beetroot ‘coulis’. not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. main course of fish ..the fish was too soft and cold and probably defrosted. chips excellent. expensive meal . pleasant service but food quality unimpressive. 
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual “fries” restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
only pavilion on a beautiful beach.  adventurous menu and great service.  we thoroughly enjoyed a long lunch.  unfortunately most of us ended up with stomach trouble later in the day.  so pls check your kitchen.
visited this restaurant today and decided to try something different: pad thai. quite a disappointment and does not even resemble the original thai recipe. ambiance and services are good though
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.
"now, from a restaurant located in a marina you’d expect that they are used to handling large groups from, say, some incoming leaders yachts. but when we moored, and visited the terrace with a group of 50 persons, the staff freaked ou "
we just had a horrible meal here. it is 40 degrees out on the hottest day of the year but they refused to give me tap water with my me 
"disappointing, very small portions (seabass was two pieces of 3 by 3 cm only), expensive and quite fat (3 spoons of mayonaise on the frisian carpaccio). we expected more from what is stated to be a michelin bistro."
"this is landgoed lauswolts house bistro which is situated round the back of the hotel and reached by a trek alongside the kitchen and its associated service area. not knowing quite what to expect, we turned a corner to find that the place was absolutely rammed with just our reserved table remaining. we were handed a large menu, in dutch (fair enough,) and left to get on with i "
"we had a superb diner at this place two years ago, which was the reason to stop here for a second time. we found out that the place has new owners and also the kitchen changed .... unfortunately. it is an easy small menu, nothing special and the food was just ok. it took for ever until we where served and for us not a place we would come back.

"food average, dead silence, poor atmosphere. not recommendable. and for the quality of both the food and the surroundings, it was definitely overpriced."
"the terrace outside this hotel is very nice on a sunny warm day, so we ordered a simple lunch of cheese toasties. unfortunately it took a long time to come and when it did the meal was cold with the melted cheese congealed and unpleasant."
this is the second visit we have made to this stunning location. arriving by boat we are made to feel welcome and were offered a reservation for din 
"nice outdoor dining by the motor yachts. food was good, not great. service was good despite our language barrier."
"we are a group of friends on a boat and wanted to have a good dinner out . the food was good but the service absolutely lousy . not friendly at all , no smiles .. just a very grumpy attitude ."
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
"perhaps the best asian/chinese restaurant in emmelord but as is usual the menue and preparations are adapted to local tastes. this time we had take away and while filling and with good ingredients it lacked any special surprises. still, if we wanted chinese again wed choose here. located beneath the le mirage restaurant which i rate as the best restaurant in emmelord. "
"when we arrived we were greeted nicely and were sat right away. once we place our order thats when it went down hill. it took over an hour and 15 min to get our food. the food was ok, i had better from a fast food place. i live in germany so i am used to dinner taking awhile but this was horrible. will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone."
i’m at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
"this mansion was advertised as a pleasant and welcoming lunchtime stop during a countryside hike. unfortunately we were rather dismissively told that we could not be served anything, not even a coffee, due to lack of staff (dispite visible evidence to the contrary). hikers are obviously not regarded as welcome guests. avoid."
"the food we had was enjoyable, but i am not sure anyone could cope with the volume of food on offer and whilst it sounds attractive, the food is very filling and we only got through two of five available rounds of choices and felt a little expensive in the circumstances. downside, there was no english translation of the menu (there were small pictures) and it was only with the benefit of a kind local patron that we understood how the menu worked. "
"we usually go to sumo in haarlem for sushi, but we ate at mikaku a few times. the location is fine (enough parking) and the staff is friendly. the food is ok, fresh and the selection is good. but if you expect great sushi, i suggest you go to sumo in stead. not to sound negative, but somehow the sushi is not that yummy."
"we stayed for a night in one of the larger rooms @ € 130. yes, the room is larger (5x5m), but the bathroom is tiny (1,5x1,5m) with a defunctioning light above the washbasin. tapestry in the room may have a shampooi "
"since it was a week of a school holiday, lots of hotels were fully booked. therefor, i had to find a hotel in the region and found this hotel on the internet. i have booked two nights, but i left after one. for business, this is not the right hotel: very poor or no internet connection, since you are in the middel of nowhere. also, no mobile connection! the employees of the hotel were nevertheless very helpful by installing a television in my room since there wasnt one (since i could not work, i liked to watch a champions league soccer match) . diner and breakfast were good. all and all, i think this a nice hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet with your partner, but not for business!"
nice but far from spectacular. have eaten in a lot of michelin star restaurants all over the world or “mentioned” restaurants from the guide so maybe my expectations got in the way. i wasn’t surprised by anything served. service was great wine paring as should be but overall the experience was below even one star. (personal opinion) desert as per picture an overkill. it didn’t leave you with the pleasant feeling as it should have been. i will not be back.
"very good, professional and friendly service. the dishes are beautifully presented and show a lot of technical skills. so many different dishes with every course, many excellent on their own but no balance in overall dish. most times in great kitchens less is more. wine list which is overall poor and many selections overpriced. for me not a two star."
"we entered with high expectations, but were quickly disappointed. the interior is kinda blunt and closed, acoustics allowing you to hear every word of what is said at the next table. the service was a little cool, and even though prices are very reasonable, wed like to know what we will have to pay in advance - neither the drinks, the lunch menu or the coffee were priced beforehand. food was good, but quite salty and not all food combinations worked out well - my taste buds wrangled a long time with the different flavours they were exposed to. done quite a few michelin star rated restaurants lately, but there seems to be some discrepancy here."
"the food at this place is pretty good indeed. something to be expected obviously, when going to a star restaurant. especially the fish specialities (fruit de mare) and the vegetarian hotdog were super! it is a real fishy place and it does incorporate the local specialties really good. nevertheless, compared to other restaurant in this class, i was a little bit disappointed. i had to ask for my wine, the vegetarian options were often a bit somber in comparison to the real dish and it was not really clear when the menu finished, since we were not asked for coffee or tea. not sure what happened and i do expect something different from a high-range restaurant. nevertheless, we did totally enjoy the evening from 7 to 12! in that sense it was totally worth the money."
"this really was a waste of money! we like good food, go out to restaurants at least once a week and dont mind to pay more when it is worth it. our first experience was on the apartment, see the review under hotel. this was equally if not more disappointing. then the meal: to poor a very spicy sauce over good oysters doesnt make them better but that can be my taste. then the most annoying thing was the amount of alcohol they pored as part of the wine arrangement. i presumed that the amount would be so that you can empty all the glasses in line with the diner. especially at a star restaurant they should think about this. but if you have a starter, 7 dishes, and a dessert, and at all of those you expect your guests to drink a very full glass of wine, i dont think you know your business. this means 2 bottles per person! and if you dared not to finish your glass they left it at the table. so at the end of our meal with 4 people the whole table was full of half empty glasses. and although i can stand some alcohol i am not sure what the dessert was anymore. for me this means you dont know what you are doing and dont care about your guests. after complaining afterwards by email they also didnt care at all which made it even worse."
"we headed over to de kromme watergang for lunch, taking advantage of the restaurantweek menu on offer. basic menu price came to € 42.50 per person, which is of course a steal for a 2* place. additional courses were charged at € 24 per course, which is in line with what youd expect at a 2*. so far, so go "
"de kromme watergang is close to the top of the dutch culinary olympus, hence the hope and expectations of our group-of-five on an unforgettable eating experience were high. well, the bill ran well over 600 euro for a 5 person lunch, so at least that part was in line with the expectations, but alas that was about it. food is excellent of course, but that is, at 2 star level, not enough. two dishes with cod and flounder were too small and not very special in taste nor texture. the combination of pork and eal was surprizing, but again very small. the wine tasting arrangement was also served in un- generous volumes and the wine choises were rather middle of the road. i guess it must be the adria tricks with mousses and foams that have lifted this restaurant to 2 star level, but as customers start to see through this, a re-evaluation and return to real value for money, is imminent and restaurants like this one will have to adapt or die. all in all the kromme watergang provides a formal, but not very warm and generous welcome. we wont return."
"food is excellent, not cheap but very nice. staff was either busy with themselves or inexperienced. will not go back because of poor service."
"we wanted japanese food. the atmosphere was great, the food excellent, the service very nice, but it was a bit expensive."
"we visited with a group of colleagues for our delayed xmas dinner. the restaurant has a nice setting for this, but unfortunately we were spread over 2 tables which broke the team spirit a bi "
"this place got a lot of press coverage, because of the celebrity clientele who happen to live nearby. valet parking and lounge atmosphere are cool, but the food quality is nowhere near what i expected, especially for the price."
"this restaurant has a lovely location and to sit outside would be very pleasant on a sunny day. the interior is very interesting but can be noisy. food was fine without being special, but the service (by, i presume, the manager) was unfriendly, bordering on rude."
my wife and i visited this restaurant with high expectations but left dissapointed. the food was ok but the place felt very stuffyand you feel you have to whisper as there is virtually no atmosphe 
nice location on the edge of blaricum natuur reserve the restaurant has a nice pleasant cosy feeling with a nice terras overlooking the heather fields . food is well presented looks good but is not always freshly prepared . when busy service is slow

"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didn’t expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menù in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, it’s so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "

"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."
having lived in this village we went back for lunch without reservati 
i visited this place more often in the past. had not been for a long time but went here with the team (20 of us) in octobe 
"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
food was decent the rest was more then terrible… service was the worst i ever had… menagment have big mouth so are the people working here… not recommend..
worst restaurant ever! we ordered a few dishes and then a different family arrived. after a hour they got there food and we still didn’t get any. i don’t recommend this place.
"the weather on this februari afternoon was inviting for a nice walk along the beach. after this walk we settled down in the outdoor seating area of strandrestaurant ff tijd. as the sun was shining, we had a nice sit down, albeit with our coats on, with a nice view of the beach an a calm sea. nothing could go wrong for a three point rating now, despite the prices of the simple drinks and food through the roof, the funny taste of the latte macchiato and the staff who clearly didnt enjoy their job. "
we ordered a simple “broodplank” and waited close to 30 min! ridiculous. the only plus is the proximity to the beach
"this is your average beach bar, nice to sit and have a drink. the kids love that they have a bouncy castle."
"nice location, friendly people, but expensive, the wine could have a bit more for the amount they ask for a gla "
"the food was bland, even worse was the service.  the owner walked as if he had just lost his loved ones"
the owner of the company doesnt alow people te order food because of religion reasons. people needed to leave the store.
guy who served the food picked his nose and than touched my fish. when i said to him why did you do that he said i can do whatever i want. never again
"totally the worst fish ever not a recommendation if you want to eat fish, seems as it was from 2 days due to the smell of it"
the worst service i have ever met. unacceptable behaviour for the civilised people. shame of the netherlands.
"the restaurant was recommended as “the place to be ” in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
we went to this place based on reviews and drove a good 30 minutes to eat here one evening. we both came away feeling disappointed after €110 meal for 
"the food is tasty and varied, but the idea to share dishes did not work for us. the brazed pigs cheeks with risotto had 5 nice meaty cheeks, but hardly any risotto. more risotto can be ordered separately as a side, but that brings the price to 20 euros. the stoba stew was mostly sauce and could have done with a staple. the naan bread on the menu is not the same as naan in england. as a thin pancake/pitta it was very little as a starter. so we left a bit hungry. having said that, the view towards the water and all the big boats going by is great. "
"excellent ambience and food let down by sharers pricing and relentless attempts to up-sell. ended up paying over €50 for small dinner, one small mineral water and one minute coffee. we did not ask for bill but over-efficient service left us feeling ushered out."
well the food was ok. had to ask for menu etc so service a bit slow. but it now has a order a few starters and mains to make a meal - but thats not what we wanted as we both like different food 
"we were barely allowed to use the toilet. uptight staff, and by no means a warm welcome. not suitable for normal people."

law quality hamburgers taste like red label meat from the supermarket. the waiter refused to add boild eeg. too expensive and law value for money.
"this is the second time i have been to this restaurant. on both occasions as a part of a group (12, but pre-booked). the things that were good and bad about this restaurant were the same things that were good and bad on the previous visit. it is very close to the ferry port so it is a convenient place to eat before boarding the ferry. the restaurant cannot be unaware of the time constraint this impose "
"as ships go by.... the location of torpedoloods is as good as it gets. you can see all the ships coming and going from and to rotterdam. amazing. but please if you are a culinary type of person, do not order any evening meal or warm lunch as even macdonalds makes better fish and chips :-) the seabass was fatty, overcooked and tasteless, the sauces accompanying the mussels were absolutely non descript. added to the poor quality of the food, are the prices. way too expensive for what the meal is wort. so grab a coffeeor a beer, enjoy the view and than move on...."
one of many but a good place to sit. the staff is friendly and it is reasonably priced as well. not a bad place at all.
"i went here with a friend. i had a beer and a hamburger (for 17,75€). the patty was too thick but the circumference was too small. worse is that the flavor was quite bad: the meat was not tasty, the cheese was not tasty, the sauce was not good, the bun was a bit dr "

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my saté (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
"ok looked and smelt ok, spoke in english to someone who thought the best way to communicate with me was to shout at the top of his annoying voi "
"i accept that i cannot speak dutch but i would have thought that a seafood restaurant would understand what is meant by “fish and chips”! the young man serving seemed incapable of taking this order. i managed to place and order for calamaris but the second meal of “fish and chips” seemed beyond his comprehension despite a helpful dutch person trying to assist. finally by pointing i managed to place an order for the 2 meals which cost some £35.00!!! then when i tried to pay using my credit card i was told they don’t accept credit cards. however the machine refused to accept my debit card also! at this point having come to the end of my tether we left in disgust. we had spent the previous 10 days travelling through the netherlands, germany and poland and encountered no difficulties so why this fish and chip shop which is directly by the ferry port to england has such a problem with an order for “fish and chips” completely eludes me! i was also surprised that the senior staff working behind the counter gave the young man no assistance at all. i will definitely not return. "
"delicious fish. beautiful view on the waterway. its typical dutch way of preparing fish, which i love."
"we waited for around 50min. for 3 portions. there is no process and service. also the quality is very minimum, not what you would expect when going to such a place."
the staff was friendly enough to make us feel being welcome. the kibbeling we got was tasty and worth the way. the fries were still ok but could have been a little bit better or lets say more crispy than th 
"vispaleis is a nice name, but it does not really match with reality. its more or less a luxury fish and chips-store. nice for a sunday-afternoon bite with the family, but not for intimate dining. a fishy snackbar..."
"the location is great, in the former trainstation. but... the foodpresentation isn’t great. the waitresses were are asking to frequently if you want something to drink (the drinks are not included in the price). the dessert (always icecream in these sort of restaurant) is very cheap ice. the taste of the icecream is really poor!!!!"

"as a family of 5 who live in the same house and are a household, we were allowed into the restaurant terrace but only on a table without cover. the outside terrace (with cover) had still several tables available, but according to the waiter those were only available for couples. when it started to rain we could no longer sit outside without cover. we asked to sit at a different location, where 2 tables could be merged. this was not possible according to the staff. we were forced to leave when the rain became unbearable. no other option was discussabl "
"here you have 3 options, firstly the standard buffet with the usual suspects, sweet and sour pork etc, or you can choose from a heap of fresh ingredients and have them either wok fried, whereby your selected items are put in boiling water, then into the wok with your choice of sauce, or you can have your selected items fried on the grill teppenyaki style. the food all tasted a bit bland and not terribly inspiring, more a production line with a bit of theatre. having said that you can eat all you want and the staff are pleasant enough, and its not expensive. seems popular with the locals."
"you eat as much as you want for a very reasonable price. it is fun to make your choice of vegetables, fish or meats for the wok or the grill."
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"i’ve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didn’t really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"arrived for a late lunch around 15.45 with a group of eight people & the staff took their sweet time to take our order. by that time (16.02) we were told that the kitchen would not be serving food after 16.00! if the waiter had told us that the kitchen closed at 16.00 we might have place our order immediately with the drinks order or gone somewhere else instead of wasting our time! the worst of it was that four of the group were guests there & were checking in, which was also why we waited to order. plus it was two minutes past four oclock, not really an issue for the kitchen i would have thought. very disappointing customer service."
"the restaurant is in a charming old building. the food was just not very well prepared and we did not like it very much. a huge portion of very salty smoked salmon as a starter, it was ok, but not the best quality, and as a main i had a pasta dish, which really is not to be recommended. other people at the table had fish, which looked ok, but was rather boring: it was fried fish, without anything added to it."
"we ate here with a coupon deal, fixed menu with a few choic "
"the beer was served by a lovely attentive waiter. we sat outside in comfortable chairs enjoying the sunshine. we did not have a big appetite so we shared three pieces of brown bread with fried egg, roastbeef and potato sausage. a bad choice. it was ok quality but a weird mixture."
"we visited this eetcafe with another aussie couple during june. it has a limited menu, friendly staff and a great atmosphere. meals ordered were spare ribs, which were very good, and the local fish, kabeljauw, which we thought was cooked well but not very flavorsome."
had lunch her and the food was nothing special. i had the open face ham & cheese which could have had some more ham. my wife had a chicken dish which she said was just fine.
they can’t seem to deliver the food all together - why is it ok for half the table to eat and the other to watch - slow service - and a stinky smelly terrace allowing people to smoke which came inside the restaurant and stank - not worth a visit.
"after recommendations of friends, we decided to have dinner at wonders. unfortunately we were very disappointed as we had to wait for a very long time for our main course (but it was busy so we didnt complain). when main course finally arrived, we were told our kids were too noisy (they obviously had waited a very long time for their food to arrive). clearly, not a child friendly place (despite having a child menu so one would think otherwise). would not recommend going here with kids. very disappointing."
"had dinner here a few nights ago and was very disappointed. two of us ordered the peking duck salad which was a plate of soggy salad, even though we had asked for no dressing and 3 minuscule pieces of duck which you needed a magnifying glass to see. i complained to the waiter who said he would tell the chef. we of course never heard any answer or apology. the portions are very small here and i am not a big eater. definitely not worth the money!"
"the food was bad and the service terrible. they forgot almost everything. there were also things on our bill that we didnt have, and they said we did have them"
"we arrived quite late, the place was packed, i think there was not enough waiters, it was a total disaster. they were not nice, we had to wait hours for a soup for the kids and when i asked if we could have the soup at least for the kids cos it was late, she turned round saying yes it will come when it is your turn.. then when it actually came to the table, the soup was boiling! when our food finally was served, it was ok but not great and very expensive for what it was."
very negative!!! no menu in english. very bad attitudine of waiters. you don’t get what you order. very expensive. i strongly reccomend not to eat in this place.
"very nice place with good food. we were there with friends, about 15 people. the service was a bit slow and very inelegant in serving the wine..."
"we were on a 1-day-visit in bergen. i checked the trip-advisor-reviews before we chose a restaurant, so we decided to eat at fabels. at first sight we liked the charming and welcoming decor but unfortunately this was the only thing that was charming and welcoming in this restaurant. although we were asked quite quickly to order a drink, we had to wait an eternity before one of the waitresses (4 of them standing at the bar, chatting...) reacted to our waving, because we had to make a hand-sign before anyone would come to ask what we would like to eat. we almost asked ourselves if we had put on frodos ring, because we felt completely invisible. whereas the other guests (who spoke dutch) were treated kindly, we felt like undesirable strangers. the boss passed several times at our table, he didnt say hello, didnt ask if everything was okay, he ignored us, but he was friendly with the dutch-speaking guests. the food eventually arrived, it was okay, but not fantastic. we left as soon as we could because we really didnt feel at ease. far away from the cosy atmosphere that was described in some reviews. unlike our usual habit, we didnt leave a tip, because we really disliked the unfriendly and cold service. we wont go back to this place and we dont recommend it to non-dutch-speaking people. "
"we were there pretty early, but is was quite busy already. the tables for two were very close together. food is not too fancy, but good."
"crowded place indicating that the food is good. stay away from the nacho todos, but the spare ribs were good. so was the parma ham, soft and tasty. dogs are allowed inside and is not a good combination when it rains outside. smell wet dog."
"the place is nicely located - centrally in bergen ... it is indeed quite an intimate setting and one feels relax and at ease. the service was really good and quite attentive - job well done. the only reason we rate the restaurant as average, is as a consequence of the food. the appetizers were just ok but the main course was not meeting expectations ... some of the dishes had been too long in the oven or warmer and resulting in dry food ... not succulent. the burgers are great, but without any greens on the side it was a bit naked ... one small pack of fries to share with two is equally astonishing ... i wonder how that small pack of fries would have looked if there was only one of us to order the burger :) ! the bar and standard is quite high with us ... weve done a good number of places and this was not what we had expected. we will not come back even though we live close by."
nice menu but food quality is very poor. friendly staff.
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 € for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
"we had a dinner in a pleasant environment. wine list is nice, and worth. starter was a steak tartare, which was prepared very well. this was followed by fowl for my partner, which was prepared very well, and fish roodbaars, which was not prepared well at all (still raw and fishy). so a bit of a pity. cheeses were ok but not remarkable. so overall not a bad choice, but not as good as some reviews make you believe."
popular restaurant food well prepared and good presentation had 3 course menu choice is quite limit 
"michelin 1 fork but its not worth ! nice atmosphere, friendly staff but food was very disappointing. thai chicken soup but there was no chicken in it. fish was not good. poor quality and a chef that cant cook."
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service ! "
we visited (couple) during the week for a late lunch - it was not extremely crowd 
"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"sorry guys, but this isnt chinese food. i ordered a tomato soup and it was some kind of ketchup with sugar and pieces of chicken. then i had some sort of pork deep fried and served with warm canned fruit (hence the title of the review, see picture). then i gave up, and even if i was hungry as a lion i didnt have the courage to ask for anything else. if you have to come to this place - like... every other place within 20km is closed - order the ramen: they are at least edib "
fabulous food but sooo expensive we had a takeaway and the portions were large but paid £65 for four dishes 😳😳😳
"we ate siu la ngau lau sie and  kon po ngau pin  . it looked colourful and nice. but only the vegetables tasted good. the meat was tasteless, unrecognisable. we doubted if it really was tenderloin. what a pity. the only thing i can recommend are the baked bananas. staff was indifferent."
went there a couple of nights back with my wi 
decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
"visited the restaurant on a sunday morning for a cup of coffee. i couldnt find a registration form at the entrance of the restaurant. after i ordered coffee at the collection desk, i was rudely asked if i had already completed a form. when i answered negatively, a form and pen were thrown at me. we finished our coffee and enjoyed the view."
"fastfood-style self service restaurant. a bit pricy, but food was okay. nice views from the deck. nothing fancy, but if you just want to eat, you can go here."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection. "
i found place itself somehow wear 
"it,s such a shame..we went to this part of groningen because there was an article in the volkskrant...one of the best fish restaurants in the netherlands.it was not worth the tr "
"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldn’t really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
"service was nice. food was good. menu looked quite balanced , better then earlier times we visited. having ostrich in hoogerheide who would have guessed?? portions nice. ambience little confusing but overall not a bad place to visit. if you stick to just a main course or the daily special moneywise doable . they even have special entrees easy to share! do not expect high cuisine , you will have a nice evening!"
"we got a feeling that our waiter forgot about us initially. at first before our order was taken, and then later on, after we finished our starter, the same thing happened. the restaurant was pretty full, but you would expect that the staffing is geared to deal with that. after we reminded the staff about the main course, it took another 30 mins. we had a good time nevertheless, but to really judge this restaurant it deserves another visit. the food was tasty, so i would recommend trying it."
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happened…. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside… even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
we had the “ oriental menu” including choice of a soup and a 4 multiple ingredient dish... with the choice of bami or nasi.. with coffee or thea... very tasty ... we asked to replace the bami for mihoen... ( at extra charge we discovered later on the billl)
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.🐶 it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."
we went there several times.the menu is typical dutch.food is fine but the  service is very slow. their crème caramel is really good
"fish is fresh! that is good! waiters take their time and if you go during lunch time make sure your have several hours. it takes time at this place. the baked cod, gebakken vis, has a different coating than traditional... you must like  "
"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"with the current owners, vluchthaven has changed from a luxury restaurant to a fairly simple brasserie in which you sit on second- or third-hand furniture. fish is the mainstay of the cuisine which otherwise has mediterranean traits.the food was lovely otherwise, and their white house wine quite good. on the thursday that we visited, the restaurant was pretty understaffed with only one waiter for some 20-25 clients, but his friendliness compensated our waiting time. prices, however, were quite high; we spent some 50-60 euros for a 3-course dinner."
"this is a nice restaurant, only you cant see that its closed between 17:00 and 18:0 "
"new owner and style restaurant which we must try, a birthday was the right occasion i would say. we entered via the side entrance and started with a drink outside. that went ok, we had one menu and ordered from that menu… bit strange we did not get more menus but i thought they assumed we were going inside to order (as we said we wanted to dine inside). anyway, there were plenty of girls serving but they just did their thing and did not look around it was sometimes hard to get their attention. some were ok in the service but one was a bit clumsy. anyway, starters were about to be served so we went inside (still having a very nice look over the water-edge though). starters were a shared vegetarian bruschetta, shared meat-platter, paprika soup (soup of the day) and croquettes. portion size was quite good, the soup even came with two thick slices of bread. they kindly asked if the main could be served and those came all within a minute or 3-4 (not direct) accompanied with a huge portion of fries. we ordered 2x the spare ribs (very tasty and good), chicken satay with fries and fried rice on the plate (huge salad also), salmon with bearnaise sauce, sea-bass filets and tender pork fillets. the dishes were very well made up and portion size was more than adequate. after finishing the mains we ordered desserts, coconut with pineapple (it was some kind of coconut whip cream look, tasted great), chocolate cake brownie with white chocolate ice-cream, sorbet and 2x yoghurt with crumble and fruit. mainly the yoghurt with fruit was overpriced i would say. actually all the desserts but not to bad all in all. we had a good evening the bill did not break the bank and the food itself is really good quality, but the service was below par, in particular to the food quality. i do think the boss is in the kitchen and he needs some senior girs/guys to overlook the servers. than it would be the best food in the best place with great service, now we end with just not that. keep up the good work and youll get there chef!"
"food was average, staff friendly, kitchen with low capacity & staff decided to serve two couples coming in later first such that we had to wait for little bit less than 1 hr for our lunch. by that time the couples already paid the check. only a sorry, not a normal gesture e.g. like offering the drinks for free. not coming back."
"... but still not the high quality that i am looking for in schouwen-duivenland. friendly waiters, good location, will be good in summer."
"too expensive, sharing one little salat and one little bowl of patatoes for 6 people eating spare ribbs at 16 €/person and nobody (not even the kids eaten an adult portion) felt ok with this plate, some spare ribs were half burned and the stuff seemed to avoid us as we got no bread and butter as others and drinks took a long time too. a little beer for 2,20 € is kind of ok if the service is good. but this place seemed to have enough business now with holland people so that they can treat german tourists as bad as  "
"the food isn’t half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didn’t eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth €15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now i’m sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks it’s ok to throw away €15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we don’t waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely what’s going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didn’t understand you. and i firmly asked what she didn’t understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i don’t need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way i’m waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw €10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."
"we did visit the restaurant last weekend for the first time. we ate some mussels and deserts....the frecnch fries by the mussels were for one person, not for 2 and that was the same for the mussels....the portions were litt "
"we came there to try mussels menu advertised on the website of the restaurant. however it wasnt available. we ended up with gratin mussels as a starter which were good. the main dishes however were just ok, without any plus or minus. average salmon and pasta. i was very surprised to see in my pasta with gambas lots of bacon. good im not a vegetarian i though "
"sadly la plaisanterie was the only place we found open for coffee, in this pretty harbour square with its lovely, seasonally-decorated hous "
we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.
had a quick lunch here out on the terrace. salad was good and tasty with some fresh bread. service friendly enjoyable place to sit in the sun for lunch.
"we love the food here, everything is beautifully made and presented so has an amazing kitchen. it’s a little on the pricy side here for it’s location. staff are good but always seem very serious so come across very frosty. we must have been there about 30 times last year and we still don’t raise much of a smile from the staff - maybe they hate us! ;)"
"had dinner with friends there very recently. lovely ambience, a very comprehensive and original menu. the food was well presented and more than deliciou "
"went in for a quick bite during lunch time. friendly face service, accomodating to vegetarian request. glass of fresh orange juice (delicious) and a sandwich-bun with mozzarella, tomato, pesto(tasty and filling). together 10 euros."
wow i can’t believe the service over there. we where with a group of 8 people. the food was cold!!! after we went to the club and they couldn’t find or reservation. jose and one girl came with the bottle’s with a bad attitude .. after all bad service never never again!!!!!!!!!!! rude employee’s
"this place has a really nice terrace next to the roundabout. we had coffee and vlaai here. what bothered me is the standard choices of vlaai, it seems no one in this part of the country haves an incliment to differentiate from the rest. its all the same everywher "
"ate here with friends during a cycling trip last weekend: the service is very good and the interior is great as well. the food looked amazing, but the taste was not really good: my fish soup was very salty and i presume my stomach cramps were due to this soup ;( my friends hamburger was also not very good, the price was around 10eur, but he received cheap chicken-nugget like patties on a bun. our other friend had no complaints with his hearty pancake."
"the paal6 has a lovely location right by the sea and is beautifully decorated. also the food is very nice, with some lovely choices and they are well prepared for kids too. unfortunately the staff, with some exceptions who were very nice, is quite unfriendly and inattentive. i think this is a shame, because if it weren’t for this, the place would have received 5 points from me."
22.5 € for a 150gr. fish is to much and the one gamba and four crispy cute chips was very funny sorry but that was a disaster dinner
we stopped here in the hope for a late lunch / early dinner but were informed no food could be ordered at that time - it was approx. 4pm. naturally we were disappointed and hungry! we did however stay for drink 
"went there for diner with family, food was ok but overpriced. you have to pay for the view, close to the beach. before 20:00 very noisy due to kids. service rather lame and not paying attention. dogs allowed. not recommended...."
"the paal 6 is a bar/restaurant on poles on a beautiful, seemingly endless beach in noord holland. it is one of the few beachside places to remain open during winter, but the surroundings are also very busy during summer. so if calm and serenity are your thing, maybe look a few hundred meters to the left/right: the beach is huge, and most people stay very close to the restaurant( "
"we recently visited the coast of north holland and after a lovely walk through the dunes and along the shore we decided to stop for some lunch. this restaurant is up on poles, nestled against the dunes, and has a beautiful view of the ocean. after a walk along the beach in december its nice and warm inside. on the afternoon we were there it was quiet on the beach and in the restaurant. the menu is typical dutch fare, paninis, some sandwiches etc. prices are high compared to other restaurants. the service was slow and surly. the food we ordered was fair to go "
"actually i would have liked to give brammetje a good. but this is not an option. brammetje serves good, straightforward food. the ambiance is nice and the staff is very friendly and attentive. the food could have been more balanced in terms of calories; the menu was pretty heavy. but over all certainly a nice place to go if youre in a beach oriented place like julianadorp."
"we went there on a saturday night because we wanted to have a pleasant dinner. we had no problems getting a reservation. the ambiance was nice, the table setting was nice, the bathrooms were nice and clean – so thats a big pl "
"dont quite get the concept of italian tapas. italian food is wholesome, its filling and plentiful. if youre hungry the small platters and having to order from a limited menu will frustrate you. oh and you have to write down your order and hand it to the waitress...🙄"
the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
this place was not good at all. starter ( calamari) and kids’ pasta were way too simple and nothing special abou 
"i ordere tom yum prawns. it arived in a bowl drenched in half a cup of oil with no chilli, coriander, lime, garlic or ginger in site. when i brought it under the attention of the owner she rudely informed me that this is their way of cooking tom yum. i did not eat it but was billed €13 for it. restauranteurs like this are tipping their customers off ....but at their own detriment. they might cash in on us once but times are tough and and ignorant attitude like this will count against them on the long ru "
went here for a saturday evening dinner. it is located near a holiday park and therefore lot of people from that park were dining there with children. as the (nicely looking) interior is made of lots of metal and other hard surfaces it is quite noisy. the interior itself is industrial style and very nice looki 
"the restaurant is part of a big holiday resort. place is clean and looks quite nice. staff is very friendly. food is ok, but could be better. the choice of dishes is interesting, also trying to serve asian dishes and other out of the box stuff might be a bridge too far."
"came to this store to try the pizza take away service as our dog was not allowed into the restaurant. friendly reception and ample parking. pizza however was a real let down. pizza dough tasted like cardboard and quickly heated, toppings were ok. if you enjoy pizza go elsewhere or buy a frozen one in the supermarket. poor value for money. do not recommend! "
"there is an information button for each menu. but only half of the dishes actually have something about allergens. so i ordered a salad (which was on the menu twice, with two different prices). when i got the salad, it had different nuts in it. i asked the waiter to bring me a new salad, as i have an extreme nut allergy. after a short while, a waitress came and told us in an impossible tone that i had to ask if there were nuts in a dish. they would also charge me for the old salad and half price for the new one. there was no information about the contents of the salad via the info button and waiters could not be beckoned to the table either, as this was always ignored (we had tried to order drinks beforehand). in the eu, every restaurant and every snack bar is obliged to point out the major allergens. this includes nuts in particular! this information was not taken into account her "
never order any seafood her 
"we went for a long walk on the beach and decided to have a hot chocolate and maybe something to eat. the restaurant is outdated and furnished with cheap tables and seating and lacks warmth and atmosphere. a waiter came to our table and said drinks? no hello, no how are you? prices are high so we were thinking of leaving as we saw staff just wandering by, not really helping clients. but there was one, shall we say voluptuous lady, that did come to our table, said hello with a smile and started chatting so we decided to stay. unfortunately, the hot chocolate that we ordered had been on the stove too long so it was burnt but the kind lady immediately replaced it without questions being asked. we had some snacks as well (tosti, soup, sausage roll) and these were ok but we noted that the kind lady who served us was the only one doing her job. the rest just lingered near the kitchen. message to the owner: train your personel in hospitality and service (except the one lady mentioned)."
"went here for dinner, portions are generous and prices decent, not cheap but not overly expensive. also the quality of the food is quite good! we really enjoyed the dishes, made perfectly, portion sizes good and taste was perfec "
"wanted to have some nice drink and read a book. they had no coctails on the menu, so i ordered gin & tonic. they brought me the tiniest glass possible, i was able to pour not even a third of the tonic in it, so it tasted like pure gin. i had to ask for a bigger glass because it was undrinkable. they added the squeezing lemon thingy stick in the drink, but the lemon was stuck on it from the other side... so even though the squeezing stick is in your drink, forget about squeezing your lemon in the drink. nobody speaks english.."
"i visit ouddorp a few times a year, when the sun shines and ive been to c-side before for drinks. this time, however, i went for diner. i ordered a cheeseburger and the burger was horrible. it was obviously one of those packeged, frozen burgers,which can be ok. but it was nasty of flavour, with just a little melted cheese on a sloppy bun. there was a little slaw and a slice of tomato next to it, but not enough to hide the bad flavour. no sauce, no vegetables on the burger. i was shocked by the standard. i ate half of the burger because i was hungry but i did tell the staff my complaints about the burger and how i was unsatisfied. i asked to only pay for half the burger, because that was how much i ate, but the staff would not do so. the burger was €4,50, so were talking about €2,25, the price of a drink. she could have giving me a free drink, as a symbol. you want your customers to be happy and satisfied, right? when i told her that me and my friends (5 of us) would never come back, she did not seem to care one bit. which is her right, but having worked in restaurants myself, this kind of service is below standard and pretty shameful i think. the rest of the staff was quite friendly and they lost a big tip on this kind of behaviour. i hope the owner reads this, because he/she just lost a few €100 and a regular clientele over €2,25. not to mention the bad reviews well be giving. were taking our money to another beach bar."
"had lunch here last weekend. it was a lovely day, not too hot and behind the glass screens it was lovely to sit outside with views of the sea. we ordered large cappuccinos but were given normal sizes. they handled it well though and gave us a second cappuccino each. the sizes of the meals were huge. prices were good for the amount you get. dont expect anything fancy, but if you are looking for a nice meal on a beautiful beach, this is a good place to go. parking is close, as is a playground for the children. "
"sunny day.  weating time 1 hour for drinks en 1,5 hour for food. bad service people where leaving.  dont go here if you want to have a good time at the sea."
i can’t really say much about the restaurant or food as we waited for 25 minutes for a menu which never arrived & gave up! we asked two separate people & not one of them returned! so we left & went to zee down the road where we had a delicious meal & great service.
"beautiful seaside location. beach house atmosphere. slow and disorganised service, forgetting and mixing up orders. some members of the staff are rude, ( to be fair, many other are polite ). diverse quality of meals served"
"slow and unfriendly staff, takes too much time to clean the tables and food was okay. sorry, but no 1? we defenitely expected more..."
i was in the natural high for two times. once i was nearly not serviced and had to wait quite a while although it was not even half full. another time i got reseat 
we were there with the 6 of us. we ordered careys (some chicken and some gambas). tast was ok but ingredients were very poor.
"the food has no taste there (at least what we have eaten), but its very expensive.  unfortunately, our kids were foodpoisoned in our last day of holiday."
"setting great overlooking beach , food average ,,slightly short but vert friendly staff  good for lunch with surf shop next door , supper slightly disappointing with limited menu however still a,fun place to be"
"popped in here for a drink whilst our teens did the beach kite buggies. the coffee was very nice and staff attentive and friendly. the decor is really cool and of course views of the ocean were great. the food smelled nice (deep fried) but looked quite sad even though the menu was quite varied. we didnt eat here as it didnt look appetising. also, unfortunately the toilets stank. i could smell them before i opened the door.

"visited this beachclub for the second time. three times is a charm is the saying, but we will not come back to find out if that is really tr "
"on evening of 30 august, 4 adults came expecting dinner and reasonable service in exchange for a reaonsable price.instead, we were met with a level of aburupt rudeness which none of had experienced in year "
"unfriendly service team, especially in you are not a native speaker. actually it was our second try there. but:  never again!"
"we know this place many years. in these days of our vacation we went there two times. the place has been renovated, which is looking very goo "
food was okay but really nothing special. we had a burger and some other stuff you have on the beach. was there for dinner on a weekday and didnt needed a reservation. not like at the sister location bijmarc the service was friendly and attentive. its a good choice if you are in the area and want dinner with a view to the sea.
basic bar food. good fries. funny tasting sauce with fish and chips and the sole. fresh salad. generally large portions.
"following many reviews we visited this store for dinner twice and were not really excited. this place is popular due to its excellent location on the beach. on weekends it is packed, many tables reserved and little or no choice of outside seating. during peak hours one feels the kitchens struggles to keep up the quality. had the impression food was prepared hours in advance and had been sitting a while. choice of menu good. great place for drinks and snacks. service friendly and helpful. great for a pit stop, less so for dinner. "
"called for a drink - took ages for staff to come and clear the table we sat at. the waiter then didnt really wipe the tables, just dusted everything on to the floor so you were stood in the previous occupants food remains. ordered a beer and prosecco- the prosecco was flat with no bubbles as it should have. when trying to pay no one came near us and in the end we had to go find someone to pay our money too."
"nice location with great and spacious terrace on beautiful beach however, food is just ok. service is incredibly slow and not motivated at all. smiling is not a common attitude here. upper notch price with low range service on a great location with many opportunities to improve. "
"even though the front side of the menu says ask our staff about alergens, the waiter had no idea what i mean when i asked if its possible to get a glutenfree bread. i asked also in dutch, he still didnt know. nevermind, imma have a salad. the salad was unfortunately drenched in oil, a green oily puddle was forming at the bottom of the bowl, large as soup. they have literally 3 drinks on the menu, managed to bring me the one i did not order."
"the interior looks nice. the view is nice as well. even though there were only 20 guests, it took the staff (4 people) 15 minutes to take our order. the food was mediocre and the prices were not. staff not helpfull, grumpy."
"food and service where really not great. blonde girl in service was really rude, she didnt even bother to explain the menu."
"very nice menus, but classical, nothing very innovative, special seervice in restaurant was very good indeed"
"had a fletcher burger in the hotels restaurant and found a piece of hard, sharp plastic in my food. the incident kind of ruined my stay in this otherwise nice hotel. will definitely not come here to eat."
"we arrived happily and went to the beach, we had booked a table at the restaurant for 7pm with our two childre "
"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the portions are very small. i ordered a vegetable dish that was very disappointing you could hardly see vegetables. everything is fluffy, none substance."
"we went there last night for my 61st birthday after reading the good reviews on this site. we booked for and arrived at 1900. by 2100 we had shared 2 very small portions (like 3 bites per person) and one bread roll. the food was interesting, but perhaps the two courses we ate were trying to be interesting rather than necessarily delicious. after searching the floor to finally find one of the two waitpersons, i told him we had eaten 2 very small dishes in 2 hours and it was too slow. he did not respond as far as i could see. we waited another 10 minutes, and then got up to go, just as our fish main course was coming out of the kitchen. at that (late) moment, the waiter offered us the meal without charge and tried to make amends, saying it was a new menu this week and therefore slow. but we were fed up (or not !) and did not feel like staying after thi "
"i want to review this place in all fairness so let me start by saying i had a very nice pasta meal at this restaurant. then i ordered a take away pizza and the cheese was a bit salty; definitely not the mozzarella which is traditionally used for most real italian pizza. i went in for another take away pizza and asked them if they could use mozzarella; the owner informed me all pizza is made with gouda 48+ cheese and that they’ve been doing it for 40 years. that put me off. if you don’t care about truly traditional authentic italian pizza i guess it’s ok as a dutch cheese pie dish but for me it’s a big no no, especially as on its website the restaurant claims to serve authentic/traditional italian cuisine. obviously, dutch gouda cheese is not used in authentic italian cuisine as far as i know."
"we heard there was glutenvrij opties here. so we headed over there, around 5p. well, the food took over an hour to come out and if we didnt ask where our food was, we would still be waiting. i feel they overbooked and could not handle all the orders that night. they definitely forgot about us, my two young daughters were starving, not nice. i had to find a waiter for drinks, unreal. anyway, the food eventually came out. i had a glutenvrij pizza. it was absolutely horrific! just being honest. i usually eat or finish anything that is put in front of me. but this is the first time in my life, that i could not even come close to finishing a dinner. it tasted so horrific, and overwhelmingly salty, i couldnt believe they actually brought this out. it was like a salt pizza. i was so embarrassed for them and couldnt bare to tell them. i know we complained and they did something for us, maybe we didnt pay, dont remember. this occurred last year sometime. i will never go back. my wifes food was just not the best either. not a good night out."
"we were both disappointed. nothing felt like it has just been made. everything had the taste and texture of bought food heated and plated. the cheese sauce was awful; sorry, but it was. the soup was definitely more put together than made, and soup isnt difficult. we would not go there again."
i heard good opinions but found myself disappointed. we ordered focaccia e pane - we got regular bread /not a focacc 
"i got the mixed grill. the chicken and the shredded (shawarma) pork were good. i don’t care for the large servings of fries that seem to accompany most of the local meals. i didn’t care for the sides that came with my order. i’d pass on ordering the pork skewer again. no english menu available, but staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and accommodating to my nut allergy. "
"highly rated but when we were there it was very disappointing. waiting times were long and food was not of the highest quality. when this was mentioned to the waitress, she felt sorry for us but that was it..."
"service: to slow.  blond waitress: unfriendly, distant, shy.  waiters dont even look or ask if customers need anything."
"restaurant was full, even after people left new people came in to take their table ! good sign, righ "
"this spot isnt my favorite and ive visited at least three times. unfortunately, the first time was ok, and the remainder of times were not good...too greasy, meat was hard to eat and i smelled of grease/oil when i lef "
this is not a japanese restaurant. it is only chinese. very disappointing. i did not like the chinese food. it is all the same but prepared different. not very creative.
"men and my boyfriend visited this restaurant do some lunch. the lunch menu seemed very big with nice choices so we were impressed. we both order the tacos. we waited a long time for them. when they arrived they were awful. they were not tacos. they were tiny wraps, with a small.cold amount of beef, tiny veggies and a dollop of sauce. 2 bites and one was gome. for 5.50 euro it was an absolute rip off. cold and tiny food. we paid and then went and got some spring rolls from a different place. we would never go back to this restaurant"
"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the saté, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
year after year the same menu. french fries could be better. service is very variable with ups and downs prices are above average.
"weve asked to get a table with a dog and have been told the kitchen is closed , while other guests still came i "
"the other reviews suggested this would be a great restaurant in the vicinity but in our experience it was really not that great. the price shouldve warned me; 3 courses for 24,95 is a great deal; too good to be true. however i didnt realize this is the only dinner option they offered, so i share it here. let me start by staying the restaurant looks nice, the beers are great and the staff is very friendly. coming to the food however; the mozzarella at the caprese starter wasnt very tasty (and thats the main ingredient), the veggies and black angus steak tasted somewhat burned (even though it wasnt visibly burned) and the creme brulé was soft and mushy. for the price, it was ok, but with 4.5 stars on tripadvisor and compared to our dinner the evening before at den engel this one left is disappointed."
"friendly service, but otherwise absolute rubbish. the food was poor and we waited 2 hours from starter to main course!"
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"five employees were taking to each other at the bar, yet no one really seemed to notice i was there. the food tasted good, but seemed a bit wee for the money (€6,25)."
setting is lovely and staff are friendly and professional. but the food promises more than it delivers. homemade lemonade wasnt and a caesar salad had no chicken at all and a very anchovy heavy mayonnaise dressing. its a shame as the potential is huge. maybe we caught them on an off day? 
"the location is nice and the menu looks good. however, the taste is a bit bland and uninspiring. we had a fine main course but especially the starter and dessert we just less then we expected for the price we paid. the staff is very kind and pleasant. the good service compensates the food which is why we give it 3 stars. "
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"we visited this restaurant this weekend. we decided late so where late with booking the table (same day). it took a while before we where welcomed by ever so sweet but very inexperienced girl. it was her first day so she told us. we had a table up stairs next to a window, it was very cold that day with freezing winds which literately came through the widow. it is an old building therefore not easily heated i imagine. we requested to change tables and this was no problem. we where served by an extremely friendly spanish waiter who clearly was there for the wines as this where he excelled in. i believe they where severely understaffed that night and this resulted in some errors on this front. we got offered a glass of wine on the house to compensate. i had some very nice pata negra as starter which was very nice, the accompanying selection of three kinds of bread with its toppings where well found. main course was a dry aged entrecote which i found a bit blend, even with the aged madera saus the taste was not very outspoken. as postre we had the selection of cheeses which where to cold and therefore lacked taste a bit. overall i think we where their on a difficult night for them and i do see its potential and where they are striving towards. i will return on day for a do over."
1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"dont get me wrong...its a fine restaurant, great tastes, beautifully served  clean and well decorated....but way overpriced..."
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
hey everyo 
each round of our order is incomplete. they served late and sad thing they do not served what we ordered. and kept ignoring us! will complain to the proper authorities. we are pax of 4!! we paid 130€. i will not recommend this restaurant. bloody cheater!!!!!
"we went to zuma sushi for lunch. the cost was good and the sushi was the best i have had in the netherlands. the service could be better, more attentive, and i can imagine the frustration in the evening when its busy by people visiting this restaurant being that the service is a bit on the slow side. we had two different servers. the one was very quiet however the other one was very friendly."
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"my very first chinese restaurant in the netherlands and the first impression is good. the food was quite decent and tasted authentic, given that ive been to many restaurants in hong kong and taiwan. the restaurant itself is quite big but was relatively empty during the day. mind you, it was quite a cold day with ice on the road, which might explain it. the lighting in the restaurant is a dim so i found it slightly difficult to see the food clearly. adding a lazy susan to the table wouldve made sharing the dishes much easier. otherwise, the food tasted quite authentic."
"going to a chinese restaurant or getting chinese food from the take-away, which is almost always attached to the restaurant is sort of a habit in the netherlands. free parking is also nice with the colossal hourly rates in the city center parking facilities. that is why i try from time to time chinese restaurants in the suburbs to find the kind of chinese restaurant i will gladly return to. however, chinese restaurant rose garden was no revelation. granted, parking was free in the street and the staff was welcoming and polite, albeit a bit slow. the restaurant is clean and light, but a discordant was the slot machine in full view, complete with gamblers. furthermore, a table at the window means a view of a filling station and the multilevel car park next to the spaland shopping center. the food was obviously prepared with dedication, but, in my opinion, too much cooking oil was used for the preparation. i must admit that i am spoiled through my numerous visit to malaysia, but i cant write an enthusiastic review about the food served at the rose garden. it is average at best. so i am still searching for that special chinese restaurant, where you can say when the thought strikes you: lets go tonight."
"but the home delivered food was substandard. vegetarian foo yong egg without a trace of vegetables and mushrooms, beaten and fried egg only, and babi kecap with a sauce not even remotely associated with kecap was the score. usually the portions of a home delivery of chinese food are that large, that the leftovers, put in the fridge, can be made into a substantial tasty lunch next day with help of the microwave, but this time the leftovers were relegated to the dust bin. what had happened in the kitchen of woo ping i will never know, but they can do much better, noticing that restaurant is a steady value in schiedam for many years."

came here for a business lunch. the buffet offers a good asian style buffet with a grill to prepare stir fry and also has some typical dutch favorites offered.
"we were kicked out before i could finish my drink (or pay extra time) the place was practically empty at that time so i didn’t think it’d be a big deal to relax and finish my drink. it ruined the mood. friendly and helpful staff though, but rule doesn’t work for me. i wouldn’t return."
"we’ve been talking about this restaurant several years, finally we’ve visited this restaurant a few weeks ago. the setting of the restaurant is superb, in a quiet green surrounding, almost in the middle of nowhere… as aperitif we had ruinard, one of my favourites, with nicely presented appetizers, a nice start! then my scallops arrived, the first preparation was superb, the second (warm) was overcooked. also my langoustine as second course, first preparation tastes good, second overcooked again. pigeon as main course, could have be tasteful, if it wouldn’t be too salty and overcooked yet again. and to finish a dessert based on blood orange which gave the impression of lack of inspiration… very classic and too heavy me "
25 euro for all you can eat. chefs will prepare special dishes for you. ready food is not allways full which is little bit dissapointing. there is a lot of seats in this restaurant so you will allways get a table. ice creams are really nice. overall 7/10 -3 because food in not allways full

let’s start with the go 
welcomed at the door we were taken through to the lounge overlooking the water. we were offered a special moet et chandon. some delicious bites were served including an impressive kroepoek snack with great tast 
"the restaurants interior feels like a hotel. not really nice decorated, certainly not up to date. the food is ok but certainly not 2 michelin stars worthy. it seems michelin holland is not as strict. compare this to any 2 stars in belgium, france, spain and you will be disappointed. maybe its trendy go give a raw carrot, cowlyflower etc... as amuse, this is not what i want in a 2 star restaurant. the food was also to rich, heavy, totally not my style. the quality was certainly not bad, just not refined enough."
"nothing outstanding about the greek food here -- it was a tad greasy and disappointing. the serving size was large -- but frankly, id prefer smaller portions and better quality. the restaurant was noisy and busy, and the waitstaff were initially brusque but warmed up and became friendlier as the evening progressed."
this greek restaurant was a real disappointme

there was only tapas and you can choose from 6p different bits of tapas. in total 14 for euro 4 
the scenery in the restaurant and on the terrace is very nice. the staff is friendly and accurate. the menu gives a variety of both dutch and international dishes. the winelist is simpel but effective. the price for a simple houswine is over the top.
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paid…..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"good food, pleasant waitress but snobbish manager. too bad!! wont go back anymo "
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!😡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15’ for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! don’t waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "
driving around through the polder i decided to eat an early dinner in urk. i landed at the kaap near the lighthouse and went to this fish restaurant with view to the lake/sea si 
"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. it’s definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "

"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
25 euros for a couple of welcome cava’s 
"not that exciting, service was not too good for this price and staying outside for a drink was not an option, the terrace was almost empty!!! hate it when there is no flexibility. the food was for this price average and the service too. the wine was ok, but altogether it was an average experienc "
"trendy place, nice interior and decent location ... but some quality details made it for me rather average nouvelle cuisine. service can be better, given the price tag you finally pay for these kind of restaurants. and im used to eat from the best brasseries in town till michelin* starred restaurants. not bad, it needs extra attention."
i was invited by a friend to this restaurant which has a great ambiance and good service. however this quality was destroyed by a worm in my fish on the service plate. i guess this was one of the worst experience of my life even this may not be restaurants fault. even the waitress took care of this immediately they did not do anything ekstra for the apology except a free coffee. they could do more for this kind of scandal which will be one of my worst memory...
"nice location in a former pumping station, good food, but very overpriced. one waitress was very accommodating and friendly, the others were distant and cold. we had to wait while one of them put our coats away before we were seated, which took a long time. food was good, but looked better than it tasted. found the whole place rather pretentious and would not likely return."
"definitely not worth a part from the nice furniture, decoration of the interior and exterior sort of church on the si "

"had a simple dinner at this greek restaurant which has good food for low prices. it’s really a old fashioned greek restaurant with nothing special but accurate service. they serve traditional greek food, lots of meat but tasteful. don’t expect a classy place but somewhere where you can go with big groups. "
i had a lovely dinner with a friend in the olympi 
we had diner in this restaurant and we took the 3 courses surprise menu. even if everything was freshly cooked we didn’t find it special. we took the wine pairing and it was a good match with the plates. but we were actually disappointed by the experience. 
"i visited with 3 business associates, we all took the 4 course surprise menu. presentation was ok-ish, nothing special. the taste was quite disappointing. starter base was poached salmon, accompanied by a.o. some wild mushrooms and razor clams, all pretty tasteless. fish course was sea bass which was good, but the accompanying bulgar cooked in saffran was overpowering for the fish. main couse was beef (2 ways) with ratatouille, beef was ok, ratatouille was excellent. madiera sauce was not great. dessert with a cherry base had some red wine vinegar accompaniment which in my opinion was too sharp and did not work. my collegues took the wine accompaniment which they said was good."
the restaurant its absolutely nice to sit its a bit loud inside but nevertheless its a cosy environment. serving is done at a very friendly level. you can say this is a reference for a lot of place 
"beautifull interiour, modern, food average, to noisy, stairs going up and down with people, service good but to busy and very little personal attention."
"we decided to have our christmas dinner at restaurant de olifant in breukelen. we searched for multiple venues in the region and went with de olifant after having read the positive reviews online, despite the fact that it was on the more expensive end of the set we looked  "
"we went to this place because it was mentioned that they cook italian cuisine. the place is nice, the surrounding is beautiful (at the river vecht), the service was fine. however, the food was ok, it only reminds me far away what the taste would have been if the restaurant was located in italy. making italian food with a dutch swing, is a pity."
"i have eaten here before and it was lovely, not this time. we went for the shared dining and had a discount as well, maybe that is why. the bread and dips were great. the starter had good variation. there were mussels, cooked too long and calimari that were way too salty. there was a tomato salad with no flavor at all, but the piece of smoked mozzerlla was divine. the sauteed mushrooms were very nice. the rest of the table had some ham and vitello tonato(made with fricandau instead of veal) but i have a pork allergy, so i had a bruschetta with carpaccio, very tasty. it took a long time for the nect course to come and drinks were not refreshed. when the main course arrived, we were given the wine menu, as asked for. the cod and risotto was quite good, but the other course was pork and vegetables. i got some vegetables, and the sauce was so salty, it was inedible. the wine order was not taken. finally, after another long wait, dessert, again lots of choice. some ice-cream, nothing wrong with that. tje creme brulee and tiramisu were extremely bland. the chocolate mousse was nice, and the topping on the panna cotta was superb, but the basis tasted only of sweet. another long wait for the coffee, one of us received a cappuccino imstead of a latte and none of the coffee was very good. i really hope this was just a bad day, and not an indication that the quality is declining. "
"location is superb. ample parking. food sizes are european and more than enough when you dont want to overeat. service was friendly. tastes were fine. desert was to die for. and then again... this could be so much better if someone with knowledge of interior decoration could do over this place. the colors on the wall, floors, furniture, signs, lighting fixtures, curtain rails, bathrooms, ... it is eclectic and not warm. missed opportunity to make the look and feel of the place in sync with the aspiration on the culinary field and service. this makes the price/quality poor."

"booked the restaurant to catch up with someone and had hoped for nice weather so we could have drinks and dinner on the terrace on the vegt. unfortunately, rain so we sat in the conservatory, which was also fine. the hostess came by every 10 minutes with the same question, have you already made a choice?. it was still quite early, and we were still enjoying our drinks and kept indicating this. it was a bit irritating and at the same time also funny. we finally chose a four-course menu with cheese for dessert. each course was delicious and beautifully prepared. the lobster bisque had a good taste. also, during dinner, our hostess was irritatingly present by constantly wanting to sell glasses of wine. the location definitely gets a 10, and the dishes are well flavored and very tasty. the service staff, on the other hand, needs a refresher course in hospitality."
"everything is superb except the guest friendliness. that is why 3 stars, sorry, but costumer service is very important."
"beautiful location. the food is okay but not special. value for money is insufficient, ( 2pax, three course, 150 euro)the bill was incorrect, we had to mention it. and even after we left, we found out they still charged the tasting menu to high. vibes are a bit arrogant."
"we had a family gathering at this restaurant and were thrilled with the setting which is right by the river so outdoor dining was possible in the gorgeous weather. the service was excellent with professional and friendly staff. it suited us for the occasion for it to be slow which indeed it was. we were there for over four hours for a three course meal. the food itself was excellently prepared and cooked but unfortunately, the helpings were so small we felt the a la carte courses provided were more like a tasting menu. very disappointing considering the high cost. if the owners would just be a bit more generous with their vegetables, accompaniments i would be happy to return. the cheesboard contained four tiny pieces of cheese and one tiny slice of bread. wine started at around 28 euros a bottle and the wines we chose were excellent."
"after visiting mos in amsterdam we new it would be hard to beat, and werent wrong. we went for the taster menu and unfortunately it was a real let do "
the service was so terrible !! we ate all bread and still waiting for the food ! the waitress did not have any idea what were the ingredients... never again..
"we had diner here on a sunny evening in august, arrived by boat, parked in front of slangevegt. restaurant looks very nice, location and view is spetacular. we had a lovely table outside next tothe river. nice staff, food was nothing special, in fact we were somewhat dissapointed, very plain taste. recommended on sunny days only."
"we had dinner there this week. we started with 2 glasses of cava. we both had the slangevegt dinner menu of € 37,50 a person. it was the lobster bisque, the iberico pig, and the ice-cream with mango. the bisque was served in a champagne glass with cold foam on top. it was very salty, too salty to finish. the piece of iberico pig that my partner had was almost half fats. the ice-cream was nice. the service could be better for a place like this. we had to wait long before we were given the menu and received the menu after we had already finished our cava. i had a wine suggestion with the first 2 courses. while not having finished my first wine yet, the second was poored and the unemptied glass of white wine was taken aw "
"we had a group dinner here. the style of food was cuisine, nicely presented meals and a nice ambience in the restaurant. on site parking was convenient and the service was quite good. there was not a lot of choice in the menu and although the food was nice, i expected better for the prices we paid. would try again for lunch to see if experience is better without a large group on a busy night as it is a nice location."
"this place is all about the location - its pretty and if the sun is shining you can sit by the river watching the boats go by, a beautiful way to spend an eveni "
very nice location in one of the most expensive area of the netherla 
"we had dinner at slangevegt with a party of four. the restaurant breaths a cosy atmosphere and we were guided to the back of the restaurant where we were seated at the window overlooking the terrace and vecht river. after having an aperitif (we were not offered any hors douvres) we had a starter - i myself had lobster bisque which was served with a scallop - which was good and after that a combination of iberico pig and gambas which was even better. a pity that one of us missed forks and the other knives when the starter came. also, nobody bothered to bring the wine menu so when the starter came, we didnt have anything to drink. then, we ordered a dessert - i had cheese - that took extremely long to arrive. the waiter apologised by offering a free glass of porto which was a nice gesture. anyway, all in all a couple of service flaws but then again, good food and a nice venue. could be a very good but at the moment, slangevegt does not reach that score..."
"the service at this place was terrible. we reserved tables for 21 people, we were assigned 1 young waitress and it took the 2 hours to serve the first course of the 4-course menu."
"i have been going to slangevegt for over 3 years, mostly business but occasionally for pleasure. i always come away feeling like a person whose lover is beautiful but just gives enough to keep you coming back. i just dont feel the love. service overall is not bad but for crying out loud, a menu within 10 minutes wouldnt hurt. the staff are generally very pleasant but need to connect more often with the table- seems i need to ask for service instead of the other way around at times. the food is tasty but overpriced. like many aspiring dutch restaurants it tries too hard on presentation and form rather than taste and value. stop making a show and serve decent portions for main courses. i am not paying for cuckoo spit. you would starve without the appetizer so you will need to order both starter and main course to stave off your hunger. food is very good overall- i just think they should serve more simple quality and manly portions in a timely manner. i expect much more for what i pay but no taking away that this remains a unique restaurant in a beautiful location . like a lover however, no matter how beautiful, you need to start giving something more to keep me hanging on. "
"slangevegt is always a good place to eat or relax at the terrace on the riverside. unfortunetaly the service is very bad. the waiters act like they are the costumer instead of you. thats a pity because the whole formula is great, so i hope there will be some progression made in the service level during thiswinter. when i come back next spring i might reconsider this review."
"keep going back as i love the location and hope each time things will get better with regards to food and service, but no still a big let down. the service is so slow for a 7.30pm booking we still did not get the main course till nearly 10pm, prices are really high for what they serve and the scallops were most definitely frozen not fresh. what ever i say people will still go there because the position on the side of the river and the ambiance is lovely, they just need to tighten up there act. still would reccomend just dont expect value for money or be too hungry!"
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the saté and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
"the food is bad and priced way too high, the service is poor and on top of that the owner visibly flirts with practicality every woman (whether they are alone or with their partner) that sets foot in their restaurant whilst his thai wife yells at their own staff and treats them very bad. she must have forgotten where she came from. the only positive thing is the location."
"not good experience: slow, unhelpful service; pricy; keen to see us go even though a couple of hours before closing. lots of nicer places nearby"
"stopped for lunch with the family. situated in a large, high ceiling, recent building which also hosts an art gallery, the setting is interesting. the menu is a quite extensive list of thai dishes but which are not cheap : lunch dishes around 15 euros and dinner dishes around 25 euros. so when the dishes came, i was a little disappointed : a washed down version of bankgok street food. not bad, but nothing to die for. service is very friendly and smily albeit a little slow. if you have never been to thailand, it will give you an introduction but otherwise just enjoy the setting."
"worst dinning experience ever!! 90 minute wait on entrees, horrible service, mediocre food, they do take credit cards.......do not waste your time"
"who knows if the food is good, well never find out. we were on a very nice bike ride last saturday, a beautiful day. we saw this lovely terrace so we parked our bikes and asked if it would be alright if we had something to drink and maybe something simple, not a full dinner and that we would only be there about 20-30 minutes. it was 5:15, not exactly rush hour for dinner and they had many tables open. one woman refused to answer us so we asked another and he said we could. he (and one other wait person) then proceeded to actively avoid us! walking right by and never giving us a glance. they werent busy or rushed or understaffed. perhaps because we werent locals or dutch? (if that was the case this was the first time that ever happened). they were so obvious about it that we could not even get their attention. after 10-15 minutes, we just got us and left. the interesting thing was i was thinking about going there another time with a friend who lives in the area. but not now. maybe the food is great, but there is no reason for service like this, especially because we asked if it would be ok if we did not order dinner. we left pissed and thirsty!"
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didn’t, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service you’d expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also à la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays €3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."

"pleasent reception, clean rooms,uncomfertable bedding, adequate restaurant,  but seriously: no pasta? breakfast not included, good average."
"had a quick sunday afternoon drink with some family. to say that the service was poor was an understatement despite plenty of staff walking around. had to ask for drinks and for finger food, almost begging. drinks and food fine, service not"
"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"really nice location, with normal but good food. the menu has the standard meals like carpaccio, soup, steak, safe and salmon. service is really nice. they were extremely quick with drinks, starter and dessert but for the main course we had to wait longer which was hard for the kids as they were hungry."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"
"the food was absolutely tasteless. i ordered pasta pesto, which tasted like boiled water. despite hunger i left it in the plate. same story with my partner’s risotto. perhaps our poorest meal ev "

"had a valentines dinner here in feb 2015; staff was very friendly, and even decorated the table for me and my wife! food was what you can expect from a tapas place, its tasty, but a bit of an overload in oil/garlic (which is perhaps part of the cuisine?) - but that kind of makes every dish taste very similar! all in all, would certainly come back again due to friendly staff, and the fact that oil and garlic are actually quite tasty. a bit more variety in taste wouldnt hurt though!"
"i went to try the tapas with my husband and since we must work until 8 pm, were a little late for the all you can eat.. but we dont mind to speed up because were so tired too. the bill came up 70 something euros! we ate only a few tapas and it wasnt even meet the standard of tapas on the street of barcelona or malaga.. so dissapointed we will never eat here again! you can never get a second chance for first impression.."
we had the all you can eat tapas option for €20 per person. that is s bit of an overstatement due to the rules and the kitchen slownes

"visiting rijswijk in a cold winter afternoon, i had the chance to sat in this cafe-restaurant. not hungry i asked for a vietnamese lumpia and a beer. nice cold beer, hot lumpia, not really tasty. smiling lady serving."
"we ordered the toast veggie for lunch and the amount was a joke, just one poached egg with 5 thin slices of avocado. we certainly finished the dish in 2 minutes and told the waitress how disappointed we were about the amount, to which she replied that it was meant for breakfast. after having taken a look at the menu, we told her that actually, it was under the lunch menu to which she just replied: ok! if you are still hungry, you can always order something el "
"went here with a group of 15. had to place orders in advance. although last minute changes were made, staff remained friendly and helpful. food was good enough and was served in a timely manner. would go back next time when in rijswijk"
"a restaurant like many others, nice service and average cuisine. the fish of the main course was slightly smelly, the starter was ok. all in all not unforgettable!"
"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros •	nice terrace in busy street •	excellent wine is available •	service is good •	prices are realistic, not too high  con’s •	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"

"came here during lunch. food was unevenly divided over the group, old lady waitress was rude and as a whole the group of waiters seemed unorganized.as for the food very generic, straight from the freezer to the deep fry."
quick lunch at moshi moshi. we took an all you can eat sushi. quality was fair and service acceptable considering that the restaurant was empty. fair enough.
sushi was not fresh. grumpy service. slow service. not enough variety. expensive with regards to quality. i would avoid.
ive ate in moshi moshi several times and have always been happy with the food. the last visit i had was as part of a big group and the service did suffer a little bit.
this place is a good example with what is wrong with the concept of all-you-can-eat sushi. yes you can pile the sushi plates high and indeed the price is particularly good in relation to the quantity but they have given up completely on the quality and the taste of the food. try a real sushi place once and youll never want togo back there. never aga 
"easy concept, good quality / price, friendly service, a lot of choices, but often the same sauce is used which is a bit pity. easy to go with a group or with kids, or as a couple."
i liked the concept of an all you can eat buffet with the 5 dish at a time ordering that moshi moshi employed. the food was fairly decent and i particularly liked the smoked duck breast. certainly the highlight of my meal.
with this option you get upto 25 dis 
"this place is run by people from china - all the waiters and staff all speak cantonese to one another and even play cantonese and mandarin music in the restaurant. only buffet from 16 euro for lunch and 24 for dinner depending on the day. for lunch, you cannot order certain ite "
only possible to eat order buffet instead of a choice to order a la car 
they hide the drinks menus so you cant see how much they cost. at €2.50 for 20cl water im not surprised! food fine but really rich (presumably to get you to drink more)
i went in moshi-moshi with two friends. given the price the food was of quite good quali 
"i was in moshi moshi with a group of friends. given the price the food was ok. but the service was extremely rude. one waiter has spilled a drink over over our table. he didnt even say sorry and didnt make effort to clean it up. when we wanted to pay by cards, the waiter refused to split up the bill and wanted one person to pay the whole bill (over 250eur)!!! above all, the environment was very loud. we definitely wont go back."
the interior of this place is rather roomy and classy for a greek restaurant. it offers a wide range of menu items that seem more authentic than youd get at the average run-of-the-mill greek in your neighborho 
we took the simple menu consisting of 5 x 5 choices per person. our waitress explained the digital menu in 45 seconds resulting some confusion: we discovered soup on the third course. the food was good but its too much. we would have preferred choosing a more simple menu but that that was not possible. the restaurant is crowded and has bad acoustics so we were unable to carry on a conversation.
the only reason the overall rating is poor instead of terrible is because the wait service on entry was actually dece 
akito sushi has a nice ambience but it is not that great when it comes to service. plates remained not picked up fromtable. long waits between dishes. sushi is decent but there are far better places in the hague. miso soup was tasteless.
"nice menu, but way too much rice in sushi so i couldnt taste any fish. although the service was good."
"ive been here on wednesday night to enjoy some sushi. the experience didnt start so good since we had to wait 30 minutes before we were helped at our table. this wasnt because the restaurant was full (it was almost empty). the entire night this was a problem, the teenagers who work here just want to make their money and go home instead of really serve customers. finally we got the tablet (quite cool system) so we could order. the food was mostly good, some dishes were a bit worse but overall i would give the food a 6 out of 10. what was a pity was the fact that the same dish did not taste the same when we ordered it the second time, they used different kind of sauces etc. although it wasnt a terrible experience, i would not go here again. better go to moshi moshi or one of the sushi restaurants in the hague."
"this is a typical chinese restaurant with the traditional dishes. the service is fast and efficient. the food is good, but nothing special. portions are big enough to share, or have it boxed for the other day."
"me and my girlfriend went there to have a nice italian meal. a trattoria typically push on a condensed menu with high quality raw materials, here instead there was everything (including pizza) and low quality. we took an home appetizer to share: fried squids + mushrooms + prosciutto and salami + carpaccio and roastbeef. all in one dish fish and meat, really no sense. salami were really low quality and high margin products. then we ordered gnocchi alla sorrentina which were overwhelming of garlic and rigatoni salciccia e funghi with super liquid cream and parsley, i had acidity after few minutes. then we ordered a seabass, which was ok, and ossobuco which was good but with a ragu really acid. service was below par but justifiable by the fact that they were all very young and unexperienced (f.i. forks and knife posed on the table with no napkin). the place itself is decent with a nice terrace but food is really bad"
"pizzas was not dry and tasteless. all in family had different pizzas, only one was decent. in addition the wait for the food was very long."
i have been to many italian pizzas but rarely have i had such a disgusting pasta as this one. pasta from a pack which had barely been cooked served with a mushroom sauce from a pack. my partners pizza was less disgusting but still pretty bad. will never come back.
"we thought we would spend the last night of our holiday at somewhere special, what an error! the decor and ambiance is fine, thats where it ends.20 minutes after we arrived we managed to order 4 starters, only 3 turned up, had to reorder. we chased the staff to order wine, the montepulciano was not available i asked for the waitress advice on an equivalent dont know dont drink red she sa "
"we ordered pizzas to go. it took nearly an hour to have them ready when the restaurant was almost empty and the waiter was not particularly friendly.  the pizzas were good, but i dont think well come back. i wish them good luck."
"we were there on a friday night, the worst night for parking as they are setting up the saturday market stal "
"besides the nice settings and location, the food and service were absolutely horrible!! the hostess was extremely rude and the waitresses were very inexperienced. the food was even worse. we ordered veal escalope with white wine & lemon dressing and it was not even remote to what we expected. the dry and tough meat was nasty and they gave us a separate plate with extremely dry and overcooked vegetables. well, not even a decent plate of food, but more like 2 pieces of broccoli, 3 disgusting potatoes and a piece of mango on the side. the portions were also very very sma "

"the food was quite nice but not amazingly good. it lacked a bit of flair in the way its being presented and how the plates are made up. the place is nicely decorated and looks very stylish, open doors to the kitchen (noise and strong neon light) are not good.. the place the restaurant is located in has a lingering sewer problem that also the new owner has not yet repaired, the result is a slight smell in the restaura "
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"

it used to be one of our favorite greek restaurants. a few weeks ago we went there with the whole fami 
quantity of gyros and tzaziki could be better. also feta was poor in the salad. menu is good as well as the red house wine.
"the food here was good and plenty. dinner comes with bits of potato and a salad. plenty of choice for everyone and kids menu available. service was ok as well, but what i suspect was the owner or manager was a bit dismissive."
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than € 6,00 per bottle….!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!

"we picked this restaurant for a family dinner, based on previous experiences by some of our group who had eaten here as a coup "
"the food was good, the prices are decent, the staff can not handle the number of guests. you really ger a slow service."
this restaurant is in the middle of the centre located at the nice harbour but unfortunately you cannot view that out of the restaurant. the food is ok as is the atmosphere; if you make a reservation ask for a table downstairs as the few tables upstairs make you feel a bit lonley.

"we ordered take away dinner during covid lockdown. i read reviews before and wanted to try their spare ribs, which were good. but rest is simply horrible: veggies and fries are from cheap, deep frozen industrial ingredients. salmon appetizer- is simple a smoked salmon that you can find in any low quality supermarket and put on your plate. seriously if you do great meat dishes, why don’t you invest in nice garnish? because it ruined all the experience (("
the worst dinner we ever had at a restaurant and very expensive ! this restaurant was « booked » by the b&b we were staying at and we discovered the principle when we arrived: 4 meals « surprised » for 45€.

"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"

"meneer wong is located in vleuten, 20 mins bus ride from utrecht central. the place has a good interior decoration, however this was the only plus point it got from me. the place has many many points to improve. first of all, they cook the tuna fish they serve with their sushi and this is a cruical mistake. their policy of ordering 1-2 plates in every round could have been understood if the portions were really small. their fried food, salads and sushi are very average and they charge quite big amount of money for this. i will not go to that place again and would not recommend."

"i like the concept of this restaurant, many choices of small portions. you are able to try different things which is always fun. good for sharing as we "
nice restaurant to go to with your children and family. good italian food. easy close by parking. saturday live music and lively atmosphere.
"i really want to like olive because i like to support local restaurant but i just am not impressed. they can’t seem to decide what type of restaurant they want to be. is it greek, italian or spanish? do i have a main course or do i have tapas from a small selection? the patio is nice and in the summer you have an amazing view. but after trying this place twice i don’t plan on giving them a third chance. "
"even after eating here i am not sure whether the main focus of the place was italian or spanish or greek. for the most part, it ended up not offering the best from these countries. the selection of dishes to offer seemed slightly strange. four of us ate there and decided to have tapas/mezes only. some of the plates like the calamares and the patatas bravas were ok – it is hard to mess these up. the pumpkin balls were also good, however the greek salad was as far removed from a typical greek salad as the moon is from athens. it was dire. the house red wine – italian – was ok but pricey. the first bottle that we had was too warm. the outside decking area was ok but nothing special. the service was a bit inconsistent – some of the waiters were better than others. i do not remember seeing any female staff - strange. i am sure you will find better places to eat in vleuten"
"the place is nothing special, but like in all chinese restaurants you get a lot of good food for a low price. i go here regularly to get my stomach filled. the food is just good"
"we love ordering our take away chinese from dong hui, have never been disappointed by the quality. you always receive more food than you could possibly eat and its always delicious. delivery time is always quick. and its really handy that you can order and pay through the thuisbezorg ap. makes ordering so much easier"
the quantity was quite good and the price was quite reasonable. but the food did not taste great despite the menu saying that certain dishes were spicy.
lets start positive: the food was good and tasty. no problems here. but we had quite a laugh becau 
"fish mixed platter was all.frozen breadcrumed food. nothing fresh. 65 euro for a handful of deep fried snacks from the wholesalers. found part of plastic bag in our cole slaw. call the staff, never even apologized or offered some form of service. just that she would show the chef. took the salad away and never replaced it. mixed grill platter was a disaster, dry met, reheated giros, very tough lam chop. baklava supposed to be greek signature dish. was not made fresh but store bought and of very poor quality. very disappointing experience. this place has been there too long, decor is 45 years old and so is their menu. staff tired and not interested. dont go there."
i am very sorry but in my opinion this establishment is not worthy of the number one position of restaurants in maarssen.there were 5 family members on a saturday evening.the food is no better than average.my mixed grill was similar to what you get in any kebab joint.the starter took half an hour to appear and the main course another one and a quarter hours.i complained to three different members of staff.one even had the audacity to dispute the length of time between courses.she argued that it had only been 45 minutes which was acceptable!this was a lie.i was then told by yet another staff member that our 5 meals would be delivered in 4 minutes.they arrived 20 minutes later!!there were no apologies but they could see we were not happy so offered a free drink.this was little compensation for such incompetence and undiplomatic behaviour.needless to say we did not bother to order a desert.we could see that various other customers were also dissatisfied.there are numerous restaurants in maarssen and most are better than this one.i recommend that you give this one a miss and spend your money elsewhere.
close to hotel carlton in walking distane. food compared what you get is expensive. taste okay but nothing special.
"different set menus to share. some of them were good some very average. fish was ok, prawns not very good. chicken is nice,..soups are fine."
"was staying at the carlton president in utrecht for a trade show and wandered down to this restaurant one evening.  decor was nice, but food was average and pricey.  a single noodle dish was the equivalent of us $19.00."
"having been a bit spoiled the past few days with the enya and slangevegt restaurants, this was certainly a couple of steps lower on the scale. saying that, the bill was also a fair bit lowe "
was first visit. we came to watch the jam sessio 
"we had a worklunch here and it was alright. some of my collegeaus advised for either the hotdog or the hamburger. i picked the first option, and it was alright. the fries were a big let down, they were way too hard and i had trouble getting them onto my cutlery. the hotdog was alright, nothing to special. my rule is that i like to get something i would not make in my own kitchen as it is either too much work, or i do not have the skills to make an excellent portion. in this case, i could have made this lunch in a fashion more too my likin "
"in a warm evening we had a dinner there with friends. kind staff, starters and food satisfying, but could not be considered excellent."
this is what the most people like: cosy and not too high standards for delicacy. we only had a starter: looked pretty but without feeling for good cooking.
"we came in for a quick dinner after a long trip. only after we had finished our drinks we became aware of the fact the kitchen opnend after 6 pm, although we directly ordered it wasnt mentioned to us. the quality of the food was poor, small rations and lousy french fries. however after travelling through belgium is was a pleasure to be served by adequate staff."
i visited this establishment with a business friend and it started out perfectly nice on the terrace next to the canal. sun was shining a good beer and glass of wine. we were helped by a young man who just started so wasn’t up to speed yet but charming and helpful. one other waitress was also pleasant enough. but one waitress had an attitude and that is just not acceptable in the hospitality indust 
"the restaurant has a sitting area on the vecht where u can have a drink or eat. as starter i had the tuna which was quite disappointing in terms of taste, presentation and size. it was very tiny pieces of tuna in a lot of broth. we enjoyed the main course more. the beef was tender and tasty. the fish was an average pan fried one...the service was good."
"this is a great example of a wanna be. great terrace on the river vecht but thats about it. meat was dry, gnocchi were anything but that and when i asked about it i was informed that the square, deep fried things on the plate were indeed gnocchi. worst meal i have had in a long time! "
"this restaurant has a fantastic terrace next to the river that flows through maarssen... we were here on a summers evening, so it was packed. the food was of a very high quality and the service was good ... all good, and was close to giving it 4/5. perhaps next time :-)"
"the place was hopping with locals , as the pizza place next door was empty. the food was good , the service was slow ( because it was busy "
"i made a reservation on line which was accepted and when we arrived , they refused us !! the restaurant closed 2 ours later (we ate in an other just in front "
i was here for dinner with my family last we 
"fine food and good service. the menu is ok and let you choose between meat, fish en salads. the menu is simple but adequate"
"the location is absolutely nice:close to the harbour of spakenburg. when you can sit on the terrace this place is really nice. however, the food and price are not more than average."
"we had lunch on the terrace near the water, which was good. the staff was friendly and the service was fast. and of course we were excited to eat out again after lockdo "
"we had to wait so long for our food, it ruined the evening. waiting staff tried hard but obviously the kitchen/management could not cope. what a disappointment."
"we had dinner last night with a party of three. the parking is free and the interior looks nice. we received 2 menus for 3. bit strange, why not just 3? we ordered starters and main dishes. the fish was €30, that is a bit over the top. all 3 dishes tasted good. normal portions nothing oversized. one portion of rice comes along. for 2 it will fit but not 3. no questions asked for additional rice. we skipped dessert, tea/coff "
"this spacious restaurant presents a rather odd mix of asian food, a little bit of chinese, thai and subliminal indonesian cuisine. the food is well prepared, but relatively generic in taste and definitely lacks spiciness. personnel is very friendly and welcoming, despite the lack of ambiance per se. we would return, but simply with the prospect of a nice meal, rather than gastronomic adventure."
when you walk in the restaurant you get a nice atmosphere and get your own seati 
"in uk, we used to wait to be seated, here you walk and get served. at first the dutch lady who served me did not speak much english, and could not tell me the special, then tried to sell me something off the menu then got another waiter who was really good, gave me the run down, starters, soups, then mains half a chicken etc.plus help your self salary, not much to say. if you like harvester salary, then your be very disappointed he "
the food offered by mei wah is good without discussion. however the environment is old fashioned and could use a renovation badly. service is with a big smile but when its busy you have to wait quite long. its not expensive!
friendly staff and they fixed the issue by taking it off the bill without having to ask for it. the chips were also fantastic and my wife enjoyed her pea so 
"from the first moment our waiter was all but welcoming. after some low quality fried typical dutch appetizers, the 6 of us had to wait 55 minutes for our main course. when prompted why it was taking so long for the fish & chips the waiter replied: thats because you ordered the appetizers! (?!?). when finally the food came the chips were hardly warm, no crispy and the crust around the cod was overcooked, really hard to crush. we were mildly vocal about the all thing and the same waiter not even apologetic... despite the order came out even wrong as one of us had requested chicke "
"we got to sit at 13:30, and the main dishes at 3:20. we were told that we had to wait so much since we took starters, and it was our fault."
"this pub should have everything going for it. location, atmosphere etc but the service was truly dreadful. there were 11 customers inside and another 8 on the terrace. my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and a red wine. simple enough you might think. ten minutes later we still had not been served despite the fact there were 4 employees wandering about. we gave up and went across the road to ome kos where we got immediate service."
"stopped to get some drinks and snacks, regretfully no table available in the shade. we waited quite long without getting any service, heating up more and more. luckily a table freed at the neighbors, so we left and got instant service."
"on a sunny evening, visit this restaurant with a terrace directly next to the canal. as you see the boats pass by, enjoy your dinner at the waterfront. when its the season order mussels. youll get a big pan full of mussels. service is bit slow."
"i was so disappointed when i came here with my wife and a couple of friends as a stop on our cycle around het gooi. we each ordered a beer and a tapas plateau to share (for €13.50) from the borrelkart (drinking snacks menu) expecting that it would be an adequate snack for the 4 of us, however the plateau came out with a few paltry slices of meat and a thin crust of bread. when we questioned the quantity we were told that the plateau was a starter for 1 person (despite it being on the drinking snack menu) and that we could not return it in lieu of another item. we were incredibly disappointed by both the food we ordered and by the service we received during our visit, and as such we would not recommend this bar when there are so many pleasant venues within such a small town."
"called here for a late lunch after visiting the castle. the terrace is directly next to the canal, with a view over the bridge and all the boats going though the locks. menu was fine, if limited. the quality of the food we had, was good and the staff very helpful. well worth trying here, if only for the position in the town."
"my, my boyfriend any my best friend went to amsterdam for a short trip. we cycled to muiderslot castle (15km one way) and have a walk around the castle and the garden. before we decided to cycled back, we wanted to have a lunch and decided for this place which was the worst idea ever. we sat inside as it was very warm outside and wanted to cool down a little b "
"the restaurant had a great atmosphere it was a typical old dutch cafe and the decoration added a nice touch. it also has a nice location near the river. when we sat down, we had to wait quite a while for someone to come take our order and after that even longer until the food was served. the people were not particularly friendly either. the food, when it came, was very nice but that did not completely make up for the poor service."
right next to uncle ko situated. just a fisherman eatery. do not expect haute cuisine. but certainly in the herft or in early spring a great place to sail to eat after a day.
"we waited 20 minutes for a table outside because they wouldnt let us sit inside which was completely empty. when a table came free outside, the waiter slapped a reserved sign down. we cycled on to naarden which was much prettier and had more choices of cafes with friendlier people. "
"the food is nice, but as the place was crowded, it took a long time to be served. some of the dishes from the menu were sold out (i wanted to order cod but there was none left). very noise and popular, busy and conviviaal though."
"this place has been here forever and ive been coming here for over 30 years. menu is still the same, food is decent, but service seems to be deterioratin "
a very nice spot in a little town. its a cosy place for a lunch or dinner. i come here now and then for over many years and it didnt change that much. its still good and they have nice food. try the sat 
"when you go to a restaurant its not just the food, its quality, service and atmosphere. we got none of this today. unbeliavebly horrible pasta, vongole and one plain for a kid. cheap patè. all dishes, pretending to be french cousine, are arranged well in advance and poorly heated on the spot before serving. only 6 more guests present for lunch and the service was disorganized and slow. the plateau royal was hilarious, stale oysters, sparse grilled(?) shrimps and a raw half lobster."
"we wanted to eat at a french restaurant in muiden for bastille day. we spotted dedeolen right near the locks with an eclectic interior. the menu was difficult to discern the difference between starters or main dishes, without much help from our waiter who probably was the owner. there was also a 3 or 4 course fixed price meal, which referred to a separate menu, which was never provided. one of us ordered a salad nicoise, which arrived with no potatoes, anchovies or olives, basically overcooked tuna on salad with canned mushrooms. when we inquired about the lack of the standard ingredients, the waiter said thats the way we serve it here. the unpleasantness continued to the end when we got the bill. it included the price of a large portion of a plate, when we clearly ordered ordered a small portion, and a plate that we clearly did not order. on complaining, the waiter questioned our dispute and didnt believe he had included a non ordered plate. when we counted the number of dishes he reluctantly adjusted the bil "
a small restaurant with a great atmosphere. food was small and was still hubgty after the visit. waiters were not focussed and soft drinks were hot.
"food was decent, staff friendly and we ate enough. but we had a very bad surprise when we went to pay: bottle of water of 0.75 cl was billed 6.50 € (not indicated in the menu). never seen something like this!!"
nice place (not expensive) for dinner with a group. service and furnishing are basic but ok. price/quality ratio is good. good variance in the menu.
if you wont to eat a lot then this is the place to go. the food is not a great but good enough. on a huge menu youll find something you like for sure. stuff is very friendly .
"staff very friendly. all you can eat sushi. value for your money. fish, meat  and veggies something for everyone."
"i went there because of the tripadvisor opinions, and apart from the service which was good, i ended up really deceived about the food quality (the fish was not even close to fresh) and the price, high if we take into account such quality."
"well, you cant expect much of an all you can eat restaurant with 3 sorts of food: japan, thai and chinese. it works the same as every all you can eat restaurant with a bit more variety to choose from. its always busy in this restaurant, but i guess its just not my cup of tea. if you want to have some descent food, ok flavors and a lot, youre at the right place. they had a strange drink on the menu: avocado milkshake; tasted good thoug "
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20€ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. i’m not sure i’d bother going again. 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 €. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
evening started not so well. hot evening and had reserved outside table weeks ahead after a colleague highly recommended it... but was refused despite several free tables outsid 
"i came here with my family, there were 8 of us in the party so at first we thought this place was a great find as it seemed spacious and modern. unfortunately the service was rude and very inattentive. the food was ok but nothing specia "
"we called in here before dinner for two glasses of cava, which seemed reasonable value at €6. we visited again on another occasion and had two glasses of the house red. this was a big mistake as it was probably the worst red wine we had ever had in our lives, it was undrinkable. we will definitely avoid the house wine in future."
not much else to say really. this is located in a busy area of a busy town so is good for a coffee or beer sitting at the tables outside and watching the world go by. free wifi too if you ask for the code.
we eat at the outside terrace. good location close to a square and in one of the main shopping streets. we were note very much impressed with the moules- frites we eat there. when serving the food the flies came along. big portions but not tastefull at all. overpriced at 27.5 euro a pers 
disappointing: we were four people but only one of us was satisfied with her fo 
"unlimited mosselen sounds wow isn’t? in my opinion is just ok, but for this price what else do we need to complain??! service are nice, their staff were friendly and nice view to sit outside. only need to be aware with cars that always passing by next to u"
"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"late afternoon 4 pm ish, called for our early evening meal. it was empty which should have rang alarm bells but we just put it down to the hour. service was indifferent. slow to arrive with the drinks despite there being no one else there. ordered 2 x half chickens and ribs + chips. of the 2 chickens, 1 was ok but the other was still breathing, no well not quite, but when i cut into it it was still bleeding. i immediately told the waitress who wasnt in the least bit apologetic, simply took it away. now any descent restaurant would have started again with fresh produce. not this one. when i got my plate back, it was the same chicken. this time i think nuked whereas at first it was obviously deep fried due to the amount of oil it was sitting in. the ribs were very dry and quite tasteless. only saving grace was the chips which were good. would i go again. no chance."
"with our family from germany (4 persons) we visited sluis and wanted to have a light lunch in de corner: 1 soup, 1 saled and a shared portion of musse "
we sat down for a quick bite. we got so much more.. it was very good. see below the picture of the tortillas.
"i was here for a lunch, light soup and meatkrokets. the peesoep was very good but the meat was not so present in the croquets i ve got served , nice salad aside and fresh bread. still a good place to go, for sandwich or meal."
"the restaurant has a wonderful location and looks very pretty inside. we selected the place based on the tripadvisor reviews but failed to realize that (late) in the afternoon we only get the lunch menu. after our disappointment, we still decided to stay. the menu was more like a magazine and was only in dutch (i was quite surprised to find the lack of english menus in quite a few places – needless to say, in most places the wait staff could translate the menu for us). the food was ok but nothing special. what annoyed us –and apparently other guests too – that we had to wait an awful lot for both the food and the bill. maybe, the high ranking of the restaurant is due to the food that is served in the evening."
"the day menu was quite ok for its price. the fries and fish were nice, but i didnt feel completely full after the meal. all in all an ok place, but not the best."
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said “5 more minutes” which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked good…"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant 🍴 is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish 🐟 soup 🍲, but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries 🍟 are ok 👌, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesn’t really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesn’t has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"
"we went to this restaurant yesterday as it had shade and we were all boiling. big mistake ! the service was unfriendly , the food was small, burnt and tasteless and over priced . shocking !"
this restaurant in typical style is situated on the marketsquare of sluis opposite the belltower ( with tourist office : vv 
terrible service . arrogant behavior of the management. the french fries were under any standard. the mussels were not hot enough... the whole atmosphere was old fashioned . a real deceiving experience. no value at all for mon 
nice cozy place to have some food. local fish or mussels are of course mandatory when eating at the coast.
"in this friendly little tourist town,we came accross this cosy restaurant amongst the well preserved historic surrounding buildings.very friendly service without being pushy.we ate seafood-mussels and a mixed seafood dish,that were well prepared and tasty.a lovely house wine and a reasonable bill.what more can you ask for?"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"the restaurant is alright but it was def not meant for people who unable to speak dutch. i understand not having an english menu, but the wait staff who seemed competent enough were not willing to help out some foreigners understanding the menu, or speaking english after we ordered and made it clear that was all we could do. shame cause we probs would have ordered more food and drink! at least we def would have tipped more for the effort. "
"visiting sluis, a lively little town, we arrived midday and it drizzled. we found a parking spot immediately opposite this restaurant and chose an outdoor table on the covered terrace. the service was quick and correct, but their heart wasnt in  "
the manager is incredibly rude and the food just wasn’t that good. this country is filled with so many lovely people and you don’t need to go out of your way to be treated badly. eat elsewhere.
"the place is located somewhere in a nice middle of nowhere, in zeeland, close to the belgian border. without a gps you will never find i "
"when we made the reservation we relied on the 4 to 5 dots on tripadvisor, sounds like a safe bet. however, 4 to 5 dots are in my opinion overrated. i always try to look at positive elements but this could really be better. the positive side: waiters and waitresses work hard and really do their best. but they should have more people around as they were understaffed in my opinion. the menu could use more fantasy. putting butter in plastic cups on the table is something you would expect in a cantina or restaurant along the road - this is not a good idea. the crevette salad could have more attention: it felt like a very quick fix. i also do not understand that you put 75 eurocent on the menu for mayonaise. i expect that to be included. taste of the courses we ordered: we have seen better. also taking into account pricing is not quite on the cheap side (that is an understatement). i encourage the restaurant to put more effort in menu and courses for such prices."
"the food was terrible. we ordered some tagliatelle with shrimps and salmon and it was just boiled pasta and boiled shrimps and salmon also boiled, all in a sauce of curry. no taste, nothing"
"went here for lunch, great welcome, kind staff. was looking forward to the “angus burger with cheddar cheese etc "
"popped into this restaurant for the first time, and we were extremely disappointed, we ordered a starter, and a main, everything started off very well, we were served an amuse bouche, then our starter of scampi and salmon arrived scampi ok a bit tasteless , we then had to wait 45 minutes for our main course, which were oysters for my wife, and cod for me, when eventually it arrived we could see that my dish of cod had been left under and probably forgotten some sort of heating to keep it warm, on top of that it had no taste, and wasnt worth the wait, our carafe of wine was very mediocre the service was pretty slow,mind you they were pretty quick to clear our plates away, compared to other places weve eaten in sluis, this place was very little value for money."
"nice pasta and salad , good service. good place for a quick lunch while visiting sluis.  not that expensive for the quality you get"
"you can not fault the restaurants location on the quay in sluis, very good outside terrace, if a little crammed in. the menu is quite extensive but i found it a little overpriced, especially the soft drinks. the food quality is good howev "
ordered 4 portions of mussels @20 euros plus one salade nicoi 
this restaurant offers a comfy cozy interior and quite friendly and swift servi 
"very nice restaurant, but unfortunately the food was average, was a bit bland if compared to other greek restaurants. the service was lacking, we werent even asked if we wanted dessert."
"not horrible if you’re not a greek food fan.  i really wanted greek and felt i got dutch trying to be greek. no authentic grape leaves for example. overall, just lacking atmosphere and authenticity."
"never in my life have i been treated this badly in a restaurant or cafe and i have been to many. the main waitress offended me when i asked after 20 minutes if my order came through than, after 40 minutes in total., still nothing while she looked at our table often. i told her and she just shrugged her shoulders. not even a sorry or surprised look...."
"terrible customer service, careless attention to quality and taste of food served. i ordered an apple tart with nuts. it was served super cold, not really able to taste anything given the serving temperature. when asked to warm up, i was told they had no time to do so. ambiance / space is nice but that is it! "
sorry but it was really not oke. first i was told to order direct because i could only have breakfast untill 11.00 but i was there at 10.35. then i orderded pancakes. this was really bad. they were very dry and hard with a spoon of jam on it. it looked and tasted like nothing. for 10 euro 
"the restaurant is in old greenhouses just outside leiden. visited on a sunday at lunchtime. its very family friendly,  so lots of kids. the food was good if not a little pricey. service was mixed but friendly enough."
"we were given a table in a very noisy place, next to the bar with a very high traffic, people, waitresses passing by, sounds of dishes glasses etc while there were other tables available. the table was not clean, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. it took really long between serving the drinks and ordering food. the food was not warm enough while it was served and the quality vs price was pretty law. i had a feeling i came to a come-eat-go place. poor hospitality."
"cannot comment on food as i could not taste it but found the behaviour of waitress extremely rude. i had been there with my 7 year old son to celebrate fathers day and had requested for a table for two. we were flatly declined and were asked to pick up something from the takeaway joint nearby. the waitress didnot even bother to suggest on a waiting time incase we wanted to wait. i could see lots of couples after us being escorted in who also didnot have any reservations hence could not really fathom the behaviour. in my so many years of stay in netherlands have not come across such a behaviour, may be waitress was having a bad day. stay blessed."
"beautiful view on a sunny day, very nicely designed space, love hanging plan "
"place looks very nice inside. i went there just for a quick drink with my bf after spending some time at the beach. the waitress in the entrance wasn’t very friendly, i’ve been asked in quiete aggressive way if she could help me with somethin "
"the food was nice (although a bit too garlicy), but the service could be much much better. they served us beer in a cracked glass, there was a hair in my plate and it was full of spider webs..."
"i had dinner here last night. the starters were good (a.o. the bieterbal), but the tuna steks were overcooked and not warm! (we specifically asked this before ordering). then they brought us the halibut dish and a quinoa burger. not very much flavour on both. so this was an average experience. great service and good espressos."
"nice location, friendly stuff, food bad. the meat was chewy, bland and for the quality too expansive. i would  not eat here a second time."
"i was refused service here on two occasions. let me elaborate. the first time i visited brasserie buitenhuis, it was about mid day i walked about 1 kilometer from my hotel and upon arrival i explained that my family had flown in earlier that day to leiden via amsterdam schiphol and was jet lagged. as a result i wanted like to get some take away food to carry for them. the man in charge explained that the dont do take away. understanding that some eateries dont do take away i simply left without any foo "

"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."

"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
we had dinner in this restaurant last we 
"waited one hour for salads and 12 uurtje lunch which is a simple combination of typical dutch food elements,easy to cook. incredible. it was ok taste but obviously nobody cares anymore if you have to wait one hour. juice not fresh.  not."
"we arrived at noon in plenty of time for the flower parade and got served drinks fairly quickly but our order of 3 tostis, 2 roast beef sandwiches and 1 smoke salmon and prawn sandwiches did not arrive despite frequently hailing a server. eventually at 1 o.clock the tostis arrived they looked pretty insipid and seemed like dried bread rather than toasted bread. after more complaints we eventually got one of the roast beef sandwiches at 1.15. finally we left at 1.30 still without food for 2 of our party. we just left the money on the table because we didnt even get the bill but we had to go to take our seats. go there if you dont mind waiting for hours."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."

"good food for a good price. nothing fancy or special but always a good place to have a meal with family or friends. the beeren restaurant in roosendaal is similar in quality to the other beren restaurants. although this one is a bit bigger than most ive visit, more spacious. staff is friendly."
a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"
do not order mussels if you don’t want to be surrounded/invaded by flies!!! not only the food was awful and tasteless but no one suggested a solution. our birthday celebration turned into a nightmare.

i had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at the photos on the websit 
i would love to rate the food and drinks but after making a reservation and showing up on time we left after 20 minutes. no service no server no questions. i understand when its busy things go slower but there were at least 6 waiters standing insi 
no idea how the food is. kitchen closes at 20h whilst they mention the restaurant closes at 22h. very confusing and no alternatives close by very dissapointing.
"very poor and slow service.  noisy, crying and running kids. food is not great. this restaurant is even worse than average dutch cafes"
more occupied of speed and sales than of the wellbeing of the customers. nice location but a litte cheap(ish)
"we went there because it was near to our holiday home and there were not many restaurants open that day. place is big but still feels cramped. food was very poor. io had a duck breast without any taste. it was served on an undefined kind of mashed potatoes that had no taste itself, but it was drowned in some gravy, of which i suspect it was just made of granules. next time when im in the neighborhood i will take a longer drive to find a decent for a dinner."
"it is always nice looking at the lake; so, this is a great place to meet othe "
the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at €1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."

"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldn’t be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when it’s busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a ‘broodje haring’ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
i have eaten here with my sisters wedding. i didnt think they did anything special for her. the menu was boring and didnt tast great.
"we visited this restaurant after quite some time for dinner again. the 4-course menu was good, food was delicious. but the service can be improve "
"because the restaurant has a michelin star we had high expectations. the food was ok, nicely presented, the service is very good and friendly. but the chef is super conservative when it comes to flavors, i just expected more."
very disappointed as reputation was so good. not a lot of taste. mismatch in taste. the only good dish was the duck. where does the star come from?
on may 30th had a 6 course dinner in this restaura 
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as it’s very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"never actually leave any reviews but felt like i had to as this restaurant clearly does not deserve the status they claim to have. reserved a table at 20:00, because they are working in shifts but then it appears they don’t as a long line was waiting for a table (where they made a reservation for) but which wasn’t free/ ready. very unprofessional service, when we joined friends of ours at another table and actually in that way solved the staff their problem they asked us ‘to check the bill ourself and arrange this ourself’ this was very rude. young, unprofessional staff who clearly don’t have any experience in hospitality related businesses. food was ok, but don’t ask for these high prices when your service is this poor"
it a local restaurant trip advisor describe it as one of the best places in the area i beg to differ food is reasonable nothing exciting service could improve  the waiter did not know whats campari orange. the location good reasonably priced
"too expensive for very average food in a worn out ambiance, poor unprofessional service and a long wait. the nearby ara hotel restaurant is a much better option."
"what used to be a good (always overpriced) place, turned into worse. waiter not interested for his guests, waiting too long to get ordered bread. my “tompouce” of asperges and smoked salmon was very bad. the crust was soft lile a sponge. even mentioning this was a confirmation at nothing more. ordered different ways of preparing our two soles, but when it was served theydid not have any clue. the asperges on a side where overcooked and too much lemon used. and than the price still overprized"
"i havent been there for a while. so to me it came as a surprises that the interior as been changed into a trendy restaurant look and feel. but thats the only change. still the same smooth service, delicious white wine and a lobster. main courses are mostly around the 25 eu "
"restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a nice retro style before, but after a change in ownership it has become quite dull without any real decorations. i came to waal with my girlfriend quite early so there were barely any people. we wanted to sit next to the windows, however the waitress told us it was impossible because the seat was reserved for people with a dog. i could understand it for one of the seats, but there were a total of five seats still vacant! finally the waitress gave us a seat in the back of the restaurant, even though the place was almost empty! after asking a waiter if we could change seats to a seat near the window he told us it was no problem and was also amazed the girl said it was not possible. after we changed seats the waitress who showed us the seat in the first place was talking with other waitresses and all of a sudden they all looked our way! not a comfortable feeling. as a starter we ordered a carpaccio which was absolutely delicious. for the main course i ordered the pasta pesto and my partner ordered the half lobster with soup. my pasta was not great, but also not bad. the lobster itself was great, but the soup we got in the first place was quite sour. we were told in the first place that we could have as much soup as we wanted. at first a waitress, who seemed to be a new worker, came to us with a small pot with the soup inside. when my partner asked to give us a bowl to fill with soup instead of pouring it on a plate with rice a more senior waitress came and reacted very strong and unfriendly that we could have a bowl once we finished this plate. after the first bowl a friendly older waiter came to us with more soup and also offered to put some liquor in the soup, why the waitress didnt offer this in the first place is unclear... because my partner liked the soup she wanted another bowl, however the waitress said it was not possible because they were out of soup(?!) it was still early so we knew this was very strange, finally the woman said it was not that they were out but the last bit in the pot was not edible so they wouldnt give us, even though we could see last time the waiter came there was still plenty of soup in the pot. after confronting the waitress she said that if we wanted more we had to order a soup for 10 euro!!! in the end she gave in and gave us another lobster soup, however this one was much more delicious than the one offered together with the lobste "

"... would have liked to be informed upfront that we would not be sitting in the actual restaurant but one of the (albeit nice) other rooms in the castle. it was very noisy and the music could hardly be heard, albeit at some stage it was put louder but with music that had nothing to do with christmas. service was friendly but not always efficient and we needed to explain about our special request three times and still the wrong cutlery and courses were put on the table. the food was high quality as was the wine. and again, location location location. could have been very good but because of the flaws not sure i would book again next year."

"first visit to this restaurant and a little bit disappointed despite the fact that the waitresses were nice. our entree/amuse was forgotten (!); you dont aks for it, though. the service was slow. the terderloin, i ordered was indeed from the grill but, in the middle red and absolutely not medium cooked. i mentioned it, but it was too late to be returned to the chef (which i understood). as a compensation i was offered a free drink, which was nice though. my partner had the tagliatelli with sea fruits. that was nice!."

"i’m disappointed to be writing this review, because the location is great and the restaurant has potentia "
service extremely slow. we had to call the waitress several times to order. a pity since the place has a nice decoration.
"we did a family dinner here. the location is nice and it offers a really nice playground for the kids. but the establishment is targeting the trendy upscale crows and you can tell walking in. its all there but it lacks a welcome atmosphere. staff is nice and helpful but the food was average. i ordered a tournedo and it was tender but a little too rare for liking. the chicken with mango chutney was nicely presented but flat in taste. and the tuna steak was too salty. so all in all, nice presentation but average on food.

"don’t order here! at mother’s day my husband and my daughter tried to make me a surprise ordering a nice breakfast! it was not delivery, no one answered phone, emails or whatsapp! the site confirmed and sent a confirmation email and even with that they didn’t show up! very disappointed! "

"cote du bouef was most expensive dish, had 60% fat, three staff members came to review. no sympathy, that is the way it should be. the chimicurru sauce was not fresh, did taste bad. 1st and last time for me. total dissapointment. "
beautiful location close to the lake however service is too slow and lengthy despite of the very basic and simple menu list. not sure if we want to come back.
i am nearly 65 and never never had such a bad experience. we took the mirror menu ...55 € . 
"over the last 30 years we probably have visited seidel some six times. nothing seems to have changed here, neither the old style entourage, the menue, nor the presentation of the food on mirro "
i just cant believe people actually like this kind of place. a terribly overpriced restaurant (with a menu in faux french and prices going above €100 for a menu per person) with a lack of atmosphere that even has the staff whispering to each othe 
"eye-wateringly expensive for very, very mediocre quality. yet it must be popular as it was quite busy for a weekday evening. clearly well-heeled clientele, with more money than sense. also feels it is run for the owners rather than the guest. example: a set menu (one of many) has to be taken by the whole table. interesting detail is that the cheapest menu costs about €15 less than when chosen as individual courses, but, no luck, as you must all have it. coffee: is only served as a servies, again, not what the guest wants, which is just a cup of coffee, but what the owners want to sell you at six! euros. the coffee is accompanied by cheap, rubbish quality chocolates and other sweet stuff. their famous mirror’, food served on a large mirror, is a concept that predates noahs ark. totally unmemorable, overpriced and tepid food."
"we took there a set for two. the quantity was enough for two but the quality was terrible. there was to taste, the food was flat, with absolutely no flavour. it didnt taste traditional chinese at all. definitely one of the worst chinese food which i even had in my life. dont waist time and money to go there."
"i think you always have to be careful with anywhere with and all you can eat concept and this place is the reason why. very cynical and mean policies around tap water and children (my 3 year old is very fussy and just wanted a tiny chicken sate, but we still had to pay 11.25). i actually thought it was illegal not to serve tap water if someone asks. we had already bought several rounds of paid drinks, but this shouldnt matter. once you notice these things, you realise the sushi quality is bad, half filled hand rolls, supermarket quality salmon and cheap fillings in everything. 100 euros for a quick, early family meal with below average food and terrible management. terrible experience, will not be back."
"had dinner there a few days ago, 4 adults, 3 kids, we had a a few beers and full dinner, food was correct, we asked for some tap water for the kids, the answer was no, we were told by the owner that the restaurant has a policy of no tap drinking water, you can only purchase water bottles, so weird, then they said they would charge us .50 euros cent per glass, we refused, i went to the mens rooms to get drinking water from the tap for the kids . they will never see us again. does anyone know with whom we can file a complaint about this?"
"to start with the best, great amuses, perfect langoustine tartare with aigre doux, great dover sole and maybe the best ever sweat breads, beautiful crust and wonderful lusciousness inside (not sure the red cabbage with apples to accompany was a good idea), wonderful cheese platt "

"we took the alliance four course menu. the portions are quite small and we found that not all the tastes came out of the different dishes being served. the waitress drowned my first course of north sea crab with the green herb dressing. there was little taste of the sole in the second course, although the truffle sauce was quite delicious. the third course was a bit of a disaster for my wife as she found buckshot in the hare. this was explained away as being risk of the trade. not something you would expect from a restaurant of this standard. the cheese trolley was excellent and with a glass of good port made up for what for us was quite a disappointing experience."
"we had diner with *dining with the stars* in this 2 star michelin restaurant. the service was ok. one girl was really friendly we sat out on the terras with a marvelous view. the sun protectings were white and very dirty, should me replaced immediately. the small tables should be vernised as the are ba "

we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff don’t seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend.

"the spot, close to the small harbor, makes it a perfect place for drinks and sit and watch the boats go by. we had hoped more from the dinner, it was quite average and the fish dish (small soles) was not sufficient for an adult eater. service is friendly though."
"very convenient for lunch or diner when you have your boat at the harbor of bornzwaag. they have a varied menu with emphasis on fish and meat dishes. the lamb curry was good, but not at all spicy. a good wine selection."
"a cozy, comfortable place to enjoy the outdoor terrace. we ordered a few drinks and an appetiser. the drinks were warm and the appetiser was pretty bad, it seems to be from a frozen package. a deep fried item called biterbollen; we have had these all over the area and these were by far the worst. they werent very hot and were doughy and bland. after that, i would not return for anything but the view.

good food but limited choice if you are staying for a week or more. opens very late (11am) so not ideal if you like a breakfast. 
"we are travellers from the terspegelt camping and just came from the minigolf and want to snack somthing with our two kids. it took a while untill the service came to our table. we ordered the beverages and asked for the menu, because there weren‘t any around there. time goes by and after 15 minutes the beverages were delivered (by friendly service) but no menu-we asked again for i "
"lovely ambiance, clean kitchen and fine servic "
"i kept giving this place a chance as the food is good, and after our tenth visit we had to give up on the staff who kept ignoring up to the point we had to keep walking over to the bar during dinner. maybe they’re understaffed but it felt a bad taste after we’d spent so much money in there over the past year. it’s now off our list sadly."
on my way to eindhoven i stopped here for dinner with my partner several days a 
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.
"expectations were high but unfortumately the restaurant did not met the expectations. the staff was good but very informal. the wait for the food was very long. the bar was occupied by non-restaurant guests so it was like you had dinner in a bar in stead of a restaurant. the food was good, the presentation was good but the portions are small. price range quite high. lets say an average of € 35 per couvert. a lot of loud people where it seems that everyone knows everyone. an incrowd place and not very inviting for outsiders. an end result with a 6. just ok."
"we planned to visit this restaurant for the lunch but as we saw theres a lot of people going inside, we cancelled it and chose other place. the building of the restaurant was former manor house and the town hall of middenbeemster."
i sat waiting for 20 min. went to the bar and told to sit and wait. switched to dutch and the very rude bartender was so apologetic. we left without eating.
"best to avoid. service very slow, poor & food terrible - totally overcooked. ordered poached eggs. like plastic. informed by staff that the eggs were poached earlier then reheated in the microwave when ordered. eggs nearly bounced off plate and were tough. spinach also re-microwaved. resulted in green slimy mush. not feeling the bubbliness of this place."
"ordered the lobster royal roll, more fancy looks than taste. thin layer of none fresh lobster on top of a lot of veg. i would recommend this only for people who want a good instagram picture, because it was visually pleasing but not to please your belly."
"really disappointed with the value of a meal here. ordered a lobster and egg “roll”. 26€. two small lobster claws and two small pieces of knuckle meat (see pic below). it really did look pitiful. service was very slow, with four servers standing around. really needs an overhaul. would not go here again. "
"dirty, untidy and shabby. what happend with this bar?? chair were duck-taped, tabels broked, tabels not cleaned, food on the chairs. this used to be a desant place to visit. sad."
…….topped off with laziness! 4 (four) waitresses/ waiters behind the counter. asked for a glas of wine. (named) they just looked at the wines- said nothing.  one found it “ 9€” stone faced.  ams needs a proper wine bar.
"what a terrible experience. you have to stand in line to get your order first, than look for a table and bring the number on a stick so its easy for the waiter to find you (.. "
disgusting. service confused with all order wrong. platter minimalist and not worth the price. also not served with bread and sauces. avoid this place

"i was looking for a spot to grab a coffee and a snack to do some work during my 9hr layover. the airport is empty and so is bubbles. im on a call therefore i find a spot and proceed to finish an urgent email i have to send. i grab the menu and see from the corner of my eye that the older blond lady who tends to the counter approaches the man sleeping in the seat next to me. she goes close to him and yells: would you like to order to wake him up and proceeds to tell him that this isnt a room. the man apologizes for falling asleep but the woman continues to be extremely rude and tells him to just leave. she comes up to me ( while i have the menu in my hands deciding if i want a tea or a coffee) she rudely asks me if i want to order. i start telling her yes ... and she cuts me off to say that this is a restaurant and i cant just be here. i look at her , shocked, and tell her that i was going to order but as she didnt seem to want people in the area, i told her i was going to but seeing her attitude id rather lea "

"flat wine, dry and unhealthy looking salmon. € 40. you should feel ashamed of yourselves. the staff are lovely though, you do not deserve them. unbelievably annoying since a food industry service professional myself."
"worst quality ever! you can t compare to caviar prunier!!! and the worst of all, it s expensive for nothing!!!"
"in transit we sat here for a drink, it is well set out with large areas between tables for people to move around with luggage. there is a large saltwater fish tank at the entrance, which looks great, and can keep children amused. there is a good selection of food and wine but it does have the typical airport price to items."
we had a quick sushi lunch before the flight. compared to other airport sushi places (like caviar house or yosushi at heathrow) the quality was not impreasiv 
"this bar used to be better, i transfer in ams a few times a year. today for €30 i got an over-oxygenated brut reserve and a three slices of gravad lachs that probably lied in the chilled counter for ages since they didnt taste of much and were on their way to a second death. pity, the staff were very nice."
"meal deal of a gravalax sandwich and glass of chablis is good. but the actual product is pretty poor. this is a self assembly deal where you make the sandwich yourself and at this price i would expect the sandwich to be prepared for me. instead you get a dry roll, solid almost frozen butter, gravalax ( nice), a piece of lettuce and a tub of something with no flavour. self assembly? real "

"this place is more premium positioned than the other restaurant at schiphol, both in options as well as prices. i like to have that option. i like to pay a bit extra, but it would be nice if the service and quality would actually reflect that, which is not the case. service is mediocre at best, feels like a mcdonalds. quality is okay-ish, wines are terribly expensive. could be better. "
"i’m regularly treating myself on a seafood platter with a glass of white wine here. it’s not the cheapest option yet as i like seafood a lot and this place serves relatively nice and fresh plates, i’m a returning customer. service is typically quick yet as everything is prepared fresh, i’ve also watched some queues building up every once and a while. nice high tables, seafood bar tables or low tables with comfortable seats."
"last week had a perfect fresh equal meal. today the sashimi and sushi was really bad. it was dried out and kept too long for sale. the rush did not make me return, i had to eat something. the served wine in the sushi deal is splendid tough. please wine bar, either just sell wine or make sure you present quality for €45"
"great, we have a delay so let’s go for some seafood. once seated(i am disabled)my husband went to collect the menu. no menu, please come to the counter and place your order. not so easy with a wheelchair and all the luggage....😢 no flexibilty from the staf. what a disaster. four trips to the counter my husband decided finally to order. the two meals we decided to order where wrongly delivered. omg can anything go right today? the only thing that went well was the wine, very expensive😉. are you disabled, blind, deaf, or otherwise not mobile? do not bother coming here, it is a disaster."
the food & wine are good and fresh. the place is comfortable and makes the waiting period a good. the staff may be unpleasant sometimes when you order.
"avoid this place , there are plenty of beautiful and much better assorted restaurants in this airpor "
i just can’t begin to say how disappointed i w 
"resturant was quite full and is close by c gates, interesting place to have a seafood bar. actualy it is sort of a selfservice and very pricy with small portion of susi (3maki + 3sushi -all tuna) for 18 euro, tuna sushi/ sashimi - same 3/3 for 24 euro, glass of white wine for 11 eu "
i like the pleasant retreat steps away from chaos ( although it can too become chaotic at rush hour) but i have seen the quality of fish products offered go down over tine. and today was the worst with very dry or excessively salty fish. very disappointing. 
the seafood is good. but the portions are very small and the service is bad. the waitresses run around as if its their first working day and have not yet learned to smile or say than
"bubbles seafood and winebar offers champagne and wine together with seafood. white wine was served at right temperature, seafood bites were fresh and tasted good. there is no service though. you have to line up each time you want to order something. prices are high and yet you get really unfriendly and arrogant service. i bet a good tip is the only way to get a smile out the staff."
"food quality is ok, as well as wine, but the restaurant is not served, so you need to order and pay at the bar  "
your large glass of wine is 185ml. that is a quarter of a bottle. they got 5 large glasses out of each bottle. that is only 150 ml. when challenged i was told  thats what a large glass looks li 
"you can enjoy a really nice seafood lunch or dinner here, complemented by a good glass of wine from a very rich selection. unfortunately, this comes at a price, and it is not always sure you will be able to find a seat after you buy your food..."
"the food quality is very good, but 20+ euros for 2 maki and 4 niguiri is a bit high. another annoying fact : the (white) wine is served way too cold. and putting a montrachet bottle in daylight and vertical position should be a penal infraction !"
"bubbles between terminals b and c at schiphol airport looks modern and inviting. ordering with the young staff is the first unpleasant experience: arrogant, like they are doing you a pleasure helping you rather than vice versa (the nespresso shop feeling). sushi was dry, not fresh with rice like a brick. price far too high, even high for airport location. try not to go there."
"the changing colour display is really an eyecatcher. even we didnt eat sea food, we stopped for a drink."
"i got an expensive sushi of poor quality, both for the fish and rice. the fish was very cold and had almost no taste. positive: at least there was the low salt soja"
i was quite happy with my sushi. nothing special but ok if you are hungry. my boss didnt like his sushi. the rest was ok. service not too friendly.
unfriendly service. server spilled champagne. did not even bother to clean up. bread was the cheapest white bread. there is no concern for good service because they are all tourists leaving the country.
"had a sushi which was like any supermarket sushi. dry, boring and expensive - 9 pieces for 22 euro. so no, no place to return to."
bubbles is located in a relatively quiet area of the airpo 
pretty much as others have described it. the food is decent and above usual airport fodder. nicely presented. the wines are also of decent qualit 
"service is very much turn-around-oriented, a true airport restaurant... quality of food is good, but service and overpriced menues restrict me giving more than 2 points."
"i visited this place several times. the service is good and the food is fresh. the price is too high for what you get, no balance!"
"i am a regular visitor of the schiphol airport and also of the bubbles bar. i love oysters and fresh sashimi and a decent glass of wine. it is all for sale in bubbles. unfortunately the service is very slow, not very friendly. although the prizes are over the top the bar/brasserie is understaffed and as a result the seats and tables are more often uncleaned than fresh and good lookin "
"is the best place to kill some time, however dont order sushi here. totally overpriced and the rice is thick fatty and watery...."
"i had a couple hours to kill, so i stopped by to have sushi. the sush was tasty, but the staff i encountered was the probably the worst i have ever encountered in all of netherlands. i asked for a table, and she insisted i get take-away. for some reason, the staff yelled everything back to me as if they thought i had a hearing problem or understanding english. it was the most frustrating dining experience. writing this review so i remember never to return next time i am in th terminal."
if you have to spend time at schiphol then this is the best place to eat. there is little ambience but there are a wide range of seafood dishes and a good range of (somewhat expensive) wines. the sushi is generally very fresh and relatively well prepared. the queues at the counter can get long so be sure to allow enough time so you dont miss your flight!
had a few hours to kill in schiphol airport so i decided to try out the bubbles seafood and winebar. i had recently read about it in klms inflight magazine where it got rave revie 
"after eating my maceral sandwich, which was very nice, i noticed two mice running around under the tables. its absolutely disgusting and unhygenic. when i complained the staff seemed to know about the mice. i would not eat there again, who knows what has been running around all over the food?"
seafood restaurant in an airport before security. we were staying in a hotel near by and decided to try this place. it is fine. i ordered wrong and didnt enjoy my meal. my husband got the fish and chips and that was good. tables are bar height. staff was friendly. prices are fair for seafood in an airport. we would eat here again.
"great location in the plaza, near the front windows.  selection of fried and fresh seafood.  tasty and quick.  not a lot of space to sit, just takeaway and find a seat."
"i ordered a fish main course with a bottle of water and one espresso. the waiter prepared immediately the espresso before preparing the main course. when i noticed that i would have wanted to have the coffee after eating the fish, she just replied: “oh, sorry”, laughing, and without offering to prepare another at the right moment, unbelievable behaviour. quality of food horrible. i’ll remember this name next time i’ll travel to schiphol just in order to make the mistake to go there again."
"i always eat here when passing through schiphol, however on my latest trip i witnessed some disturbing hygience practices, namely a staff member emptying the bin with the food hygiene gloves still on, these werent changed before going back behind the counter to serve. they also seem to handle money with the gloved hands, why they dont have one gloved hand (the food hand) and one un-gloved hand (the money hand) and regularly wash their hands.? ive seen this in the uk too. people are generally unthinking and disgusting."
"not exactly the best seafood restaurant in holland. but if you need a raw herring fix as youre transiting through ams airport, then this is the only place in the airport you can get i "
"we had a quick dinner here at schiphol. i ordered fried shrimp with rice. the rice was good, which was rather rare in holland. the shrimp was on average but a bit saltier. in general it was a so-so experience."
"had a seafood salad which was tasty, also the oyster was good but too small than i expected. maybe little bit expensive."
"walking from the railway station to the departure hall we decided to take a dinner at this trendy restaurant. we ordered paella 2/5, ikan bali rice 3/5 and a salad 3/5. the service was friendly and efficient 4/5, the furniture trendy high seats and tables 3/ "
we were here yesterday waiting for our flights departure. decided to try the locals herring fish. the food is good though a bit on the high side. you must try the herring and their fish and chi 
really nothing special but quite ok. they offer a quite wide selection of different seafood dishes.  we tried their lunch box and sushi and it was ok.
"in the mood for some seafood, but tired and not interested in a major dinner, we thought this might have some good, fresh offerings without taking a lot of time. it wasnt bad, but more fast food than specialty spot."
"i stopped here for a quick bite before heading on to amsterdam. the service was slow and i waited for over 20 minutes for the food to be ready, despite there being hardly any costumers. the food was nothing special and the salmon was not quite done. i dont think ill be back, theres plenty of other restaurants around to choose from."
"the food is typically dutch, was cooked fresh and was well present "
"i go here often during business office. the staff is friendly, fish is good and the prices are fair for airport standards. would recommend to go here for an affordable lunch or dinner at the airport."
"the crab spread sub was a-okay wasnt the greatest but thats just my taste. a different sauce would have been nicer. the squid rings were quite oily and they were so thin, not much squid and a lot of batter but portion was big. my boyfriend got cod on its own with no chips and it was quite pricey at almost € "
"too expensive, we bought two small fried fish and paid € 15 for it........ € 7.50 per piece for 6 pieces per tray kibbeling"
"there are a number of food places in the amsterdam airport, but this was different. it is a restaurant specifically aimed at providing fresh seafood. i ordered a homemade salmon sandwich and that was pretty good. i would definitely come here again, however it is definitely too expensive. it really depends if you want seafood so much you would pay for the price they offer!"
"everybody is prepared to pay a bit more at any airport (liminal spaces and all), but at happy seafood the price goes way overboard. we had the so-called big portion of kibbeling (deep-fried battered fish). on the plus side, this is kibbeling made from true cod, rather than the cheaper type of white fish often used. on the minus side, a big portion, which in the rest of the netherlands will get you around 300g of kibbeling, at happy seafood is here at most 150g, perhaps less — but at more than double the price! sometimes you pay for the nice seating, but thats emphatically not the case here: the seating area only has small, high tables with barstools that seem to be designed to get people to move on as quickly as possible. at the risk of ending with a terrible pun: at happy seafood, the foods good, the rest is fishy."
"we ordered an eel roll, packed in a small box with plastic cover. the taste was reasonable because you could taste the smokyness of the eel, but the wrap was too soft and the veggies were all mushy. 2 small rolls were almost 8 euros, which is very expensive."
"we went there with the family for a great fruits de mer, previously we visitied this restaurant to see what they were up to and capable of, and this looked then promising. at arrival there was no longer a fruit de mer on the menu. so we asked an they could make one for us. please see the pictures. this was certainly not the fruit de mer we were expecting. the king crab legs were not cooked wel, so these were replaced by normal crab claws. all in all not recommandable. so no fruit de mer in this restaurant. normal the other fish dishes are well."
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
"we went there with the family after a firm forrest walk. the staff was welchmng us very friendly as we arrived with no reservation. the staff presented the menu and the drink were taken. we ordered some starters and some main courses. the starters, a bisque with ginger and the tartar with carpers. then we had some salmon and a venis "

especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"
"we meant to book this restaurant for our anniversary, with the bongo voucher that we receive "
"let me start by saying that possibly the covid times are not making it easier to provide a 1 star michelin experience, but i nevertheless have been to a few lately that didnt have this level of experien "
"we went to this restaurant a few times twenty years ago & didnt think much of it then. we had given it a miss ever since then but decided to go there last week to see whether things have improved. it is a nice, quiet restaurant set in a small shopping street. we had a three-course meal with tea & chocolates at the end. unfortunately, things havent improved very much in the last twenty years. the food was mundane without any wow factor. even if it did not have a michelin star, the food would have been described as ordinary at best - having a michelin star made it that much worse. the service was pleasant & the restaurant was full, so perhaps it was me that didnt like it. there are many restaurants in the area, both with and without michelin stars, which are infinitely better than cheval blanc, in my opinion. it is a great pity, as the restaurant is located near where we live & hence very easy for us to get to, but i think we will have to wait another twenty years to see whether there is any improvement!"
"we had the deschamps chef menu, and we were just disappointed by the whole experience. the creations are (seem) to simple for a restaurant of this level, not exciting at all. there was also this figure that kind of runs the place, he was a bit annoying, we didnt feel very comfortable with him arou "
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the saté was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brûlée very good."

"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend €120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.

a small restaurant in the middle of the mainstreet of the village. make a reservation. good food list with meals you expect. the meat dish liver is perfect. ask for a table not to close to the entrance.

good food but a little too commercially orientated. the restaurant was packed on a tuesday. i got seated at a table that was in the middle of the path the waiters used to get to the kitchen. there shouldn’t have been a table there. i would compare the food to a happy italy but you’ve got a couple more options and it’s a little more expensive.
"busy for a weekday. enough staff to serve all the guests, we lost count of the number of waitresses/waiters coming to our table. nice food, but both pizza and calzone were very salty. the calzone was mostly crispy crust."
"just come back from a weeks stay in assen and we had to visit bella italia twice! the first visit was just myself and my wife we both had yummy pizza ( no 46) thin crust, loads of toppings and the size of a small family car wheel! what’s not to like about that, we sat inside which was a bit of a mistake as it was very warn but all in all a nice eveni "

"food is ok but not brilliant. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. thought the pizza was too greasy. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. location good though on the market, normally quite a few people eating there due to affordability. next door is better."
visit the place on a fridayevening with my girlfriend. crowded: reservation is recommend 
we were quite a large group on 2 tables. we were put under a canopy and offered blankets or at least some were. the table i was on put the order in about 10 minutes before the other table and guess who got there meal first. yep you guest the other tabl 
its a large restautant and the tables are place very close to eachother. the choice of pizza and pasta is enormous. the portions are big. we had a starter and couldnt finish the pizza.

"ive gotten pizza here twice and i can say that these are the worst pizzas ive ever had in my entire life. frozen oven pizzas at the store are more enjoyable than this, it feels like they make the pizzas with cheese and tomato sauce then just dumb a bunch of ingredients on there reheat it and done....."

"im not sure what went wrong this time. this restaurant has expanded its seating capacity without the proportinal expansion of kitchen capacity. the result is that the service is slow and clearly the staff are weary of the stress placed upon them by this imbalance. we waited nearly an hour for the starter, after asking again for it. another long delay before we invoked the five minute rule and then got up, asked for the bill for what we had had, paid and left. down the road is the el nil, excellent shoarma, served within seven minutes of our arrival!"
"i come here multiple times a year and usually i enjoy the food. tonight was below anything ive ever seen. i got served a well done steak that should have been rare. i sent it back. the second steak was a pathetic thin piece of meat, that was obviously put straight from the cooler on the grill. it was dead cold. i was the only person in the group who wasnt eating, yet the waitress manages to completely ignore this. she even goes so far as to come to our table to ask if i want anything to drink. about 45 minutes later, when clearing the table she asks was it not to your liking?... no, i always leave my steak untouched on the plate... the chef didnt wish to come because he was too busy with the other 3 tables. i left and i wont come back. "
food is all inclusive as are drinks but is of a poor quality.  our kids had to go out and get takeaway pizza ... golf was fun though!!!!

"the restaurant is located in the hotel, near a motorway exit. the restaurant is child friendly, as they have a special corner where kids can play. the food is average, nothing exceptional but typical dutch cuisine. we had fish, which was prepared ok. it is served with some french fries, potatoes and vegetables. there is a salad bar, with all kinds of different sala "
"the menu is traditional, offers a fairly good selection of dishes. staff is friendly and efficient. although the restaurant is fairly large, the restaurant is divided into smaller sections creating an intimate atmosphere."
"we didnt really want to have dinner at the van der valk hotel but on mondays a lot of restaurants in assen are closed. someone told us the food at the hotel was really okay, which is what made us decide to have dinner the "
in this part of europe hotel restaurants are more interested in giving you a filling meal that is good value for money rather than delighting the senses. meals in the van der valk hotel assen are served in a large charmless room with the window seats commanding views of the motorway and industrial estate but then no one would come here for a culinary adventure or a romantic tryst. 
"after going past most restaurants in town, that were closed, a bank holiday, we finally thought about van der valk. this used to be known for cheap food and large portions, (trucker portions they would be called), but not very fine, dining, just simple good meals, to everyones taste. but since they were a hotel, we were sure they would be open. we went there and the restaurant was nice, entirely newly decorated, well upgraded from the family rooms, it used to look like. also the running stressed students were gone and the staff seemed less temporary and very friendly and professional. the restaurant was full. as we did not have a reservation, we were lead to a side restaurant, which looked like a buffet restaurant, as it had a huge (empty) fixed buffet facility. we ordered, and though the restaurants were all full, it took longer than normal there, but still came in a relatively timely manner. the menu has become more a la mode. we ordered and enjoyed our meal, but all concluded, that it was better they stick to their simple good meals instead of making complicated mixes of different cultures in one plate and nothing really having a nice authentic taste. also gone were the large varieties of vegetables and potatoes : boiled, fried, mash and french fries, and though not ordered the mayonnaise ( a must with chips on a dutch table) was charged separately, which seems odd for a facility like this. prices had also gone up. the décor is nice and i believe this is a good place for a family meal ( with kids), on the move or other reason to have a quick meal, but no longer, an inexpensive one, but then, the netherlands, compared to germany, france, and the uk, is very overprices when it comes to dining out in general, we believe."
"we made a reservation in advance as the guidelines state but once in the restaurant no real visible precautions to be seen. we decided to have dinner inside as the terrace was pretty crowded with a lot of people smoking. the staff is willing to help but to be honest i was shocked what i saw that night, as we had a table near the open kitchen and workingspace. we have seen people collectieve their own spoons as staff forgot to bring them each time, people collecting their own beer, people asking for a menu as they were waiting for a long time already and people leaving after an hour and a half when they found out their main course order was lost in the kitchen. we ourselves had to wait quit some time but we received everything we ordered. the only thing was the repeated question on which rice/noodles we wanted. once given the girl managed to bring us the wrong dish three times stating that she did not know what fried rice was although it is in the menu. yes it was a busy evening but there was enough staff present, problem was that there was nobody in charge and there was just not enough experience present managing a restaurant. i definetely would not advise this restaurant if you want to have dinner on time, if you get any at all."
we visited this place when it was recently open 
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."
"bij sib is quite a new restaurant in emmen. we went there for dinner with the family, and although the food is really really good, there are definitely a few things that can be improved. for example, it took quite a while before someone came to take our order for drinks, the same happened with the food. on top of this, we had to wait long before we received our food. it wasnt possible to order tap water (only mineral water, which we, of course, had to pay for). the menu was not really readable, and it looked like some random dishes were put on the menu, without thinking of an overall theme. the fact that the food was really good and the staff was very friendly definitely improved our experience. therefore, i hope that the things described above will be taken into account and hopefully improved by the restaurant, because they have the potential to become one of the better restaurants of emmen!"
"good atmosphere, good service, reservations recommended on friday and saturday. not a bad eating experience, my wife had the pork kabob with ribs, which were good. meats were served on a bed of mashed potatoes with bits of spinach leaf, well presented. meal came with french fries, a salad and another potato dish (not baked). couldn’t quite determine the spice used on the second potato dish, but wasn’t to my liking. a baked, with sour cream and chives, potato would have been better. i had the ribeye, which, unfortunately was not available, but the house was gracious enough to substitute a t- bone at the same price. t-bone was a healthy size, and cooked to my request, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. questioned the waitress and found out that the meats have very little fat content, presumably the reason for being chewy. my recommendation to the cook would be to use a bit of meat tenderizer in the future. also wouldn’t hurt to marinade the steak in either a1 or hp sauce for a few hours for some additional flavor. had i ordered the t-bone at its full price i would have been disappoint "
"we were just the 2 of us, my brother and me. he had the spicy ribs and i had the steak. the steak was fine, it was of good quality but the pepper sauce looked and tasted like it was the kind where you just add water and serve. terrible. the vegetables were virtually non-existent and pretty blan "
"the restaurant and food are fine. menu is mostly what to expect from a wok. the food used to be better in my opinion. the drinks are ordered and delivered to the table, so you can focus more on eating."
"this restaurant is just fine. if you want to eat a lot for a relatively small amount of money, you should go here. the food is good, there is a nice atmosphere and you get good value for your money. its not great are amazing, but just fine. "
what can i say i will not be going ba 
"i would only save the deserts.  wok is fine, ingredients not so good. sushi a bit dry. doesnt have many choices."
"good for dutch standards. its a small restaurant, cozy and intimate for a romantic dinner. they have decent meats and a good menu in general."
"having been here a few times, i was surprised that the restaurant was listed no. 22 of restaurants in emmen when it could be a lot better then that. almost all ingredients are there, but the right recipe has not been found yet. location is not bad, and the place has a very nice feel to it. we were sitting outside in a spacious aria at the front of the restaurant. drinks were served quickly. so, the setting was there. but what was missing ? hmm perhaps that the food was just good, nothing special. meat ( rib roast ) a bit dry, and the tomato soup was almost a diluted pasta sauce. too creamy and cheesy. but all in all, not bad at all. the service was kind and helpful but during dinner they left the table unattended for too long of periods. i guess the place just needs a bit more professionalism. paying a bit more attention to details. taking away used plates quicker, and come by a bit more often to check for drinks. so, could be better, but 22nd is certainly not deserved !"
"business dinner with a colleague. we order to pizzas, nothing spezial. i was expecting more. maybe i made the wrong choice, because the restaurant was full in a thursday evening. some families and couples around.  nice decoration and service. everybody speaks fluent english."
had a seafood pizza. was nothing to get excited about. was expecting a little more that average with such a high rating. beer was flat but saw them pouring the beer and adding old beer from a glass to top it up.
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
i went here a few times. first of all i have the feeling it does not get better. furthermore i dislike the fixed prices. i went here with my pregnant sister and when she wanted to replace the more expensive beef with the much cheaper giros meat (as that is not good during the pregnancy) she was still forced to pay the same. some guests also got a free ouzo but not all.... that is not very nice. all together a rather average experience.
the plates of the main course where full of meat as is normal in greek restaura 
"they say its the best greek in town, but thats not hard with only 2 option "
"nothing special, weve been to worse but weve been to a lot better greek restaurants. we prefer to drive to meppen germany and have à greek meal there, so munch better!"
"i must say that because i was the only one who did not enjoy my meal, reflects more on me than the hotel. having said that, i had the duck and was not pleased with the taste. i wish there had been more choices on the menu, perhaps some chicken. i also did not like the vegetarian options for my sister, as she cannot eat mushrooms. she had the special which she guessed would be whatever was left in the fridge, as it was the chefs creation - and she was correct. however she enjoyed it. my mother enjoyed her sirloin, and my grandparents enjoyed their food too. so maybe it was just me! the staff was very attentive and helpful, especially with my aging grandfather. i was not left impressed by the menu choices, but otherwise it was a pleasant evening."
food taste and quality is 8/ 
"usually its really nice having sushi here bit this time it was a bit mediocre. didn’t get a lot of what we ordered and i don’t know what they did to the soy sauce but it was horribly salty. will go again though as it’s the first time in years i was a bit disappointed. usually nice fresh sushi, quick service and very reasonably priced"
"im not used to high end sushi, but this was a new low. the sushi was uninspired, dull and sloppy.  it is one of the cheaper all you can eat options out there, but the price is so low for a reason."
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"the restaurant is very customer friendly. deco is also nice and simple. but the food is often unstable of quality. sometines its really good, but most of the time very average. the prices are some what high for the unsteadiness of the quality. but the staff is very nice and deserves second changes. the delivery services are not up to par for the asking price. i will recommend to visit the restaurant."
i had a dinner at restaurant sorrento with a friend. it was during the week and around half of the available tables were occupied. after ordering it took quite some time before we got our dinner served. the food is average. i was not impressed with the service staff. the wine is quite expensive and very few wines to choose from. the pinot grigio tasted to sweet for me. i was expecting the lemon-citrus flavo 
"delicious sushi restaurant in the city center. 2,5 hours unlimited choise of food (with some exceptions like sashimi, dessert, all drinks and some other stuff you have to pay extra). however its rather expensive in comparison with other all you can eat restaurants, sushi and rolls are absolutely delicious. "
"not so good! standard sushi and everything is flavoured with sesame sauce, all tastes the same. would not go here again"
i wouldnt openly pay the €26 for the food as its not overly what i would eat so its a lot of money for a limited amount for me. if you were daring and enjoy all the food then it would well be worth it. meat done on the grill was lovely. would be better if they had english descriptions on the food also. guessing was a bit to brave for me. love the fact all drinks are included thats very good. 
great for a quick bite to eat with friends or for large gatherings. there is something for everyone. it just isnt my scene. i feel like i am sitting in the school cafeteria.
ever since this restaurant has a new owner the quality of the food has dropped to an all time low. we all had a stomachache after eating here. too many choices and everything is self service without much supervision. this used to be a good chinese wok restaurant but not much of that is left.
"the first course consisted of a board to share. cheeses, ham, delicious mushrooms. but who in the kitchen thought of tiny pieces of smoked salmon in a small piece of cold wrap? not tasty at a "
my husband and i thought this would be a nice place to have something to drink. the waitress asked if we had a reservation but it was not a problem and said we choose a table in the back. i sat down and husband went to the toilet. i was waiting to be asked what i wanted to drink. but was totally ignored by several waiters they looked at me and continued talking amongst each other and one them even went to the bar and had audacity to have a drink at the bar. only when my husband returned the waiter came to set the table and take the order. just to make it clear i am dutch-indian origin and my husband is real dutch therefore caucasian. i assume i was not good enough to be recognized as a person and only my husband was as he is white skinned. so sad that that there are still people like this in the world.

nice place with lovely views. spacious and bright restaurant with some outside space looking up to a harbou 
"this restaurant is a short walk from batavia outlet. it overlooks lelystad harbour and rather nice both in summer when the terrace is open and in the autum. the waitresses are friendly. it has a modern ambiance. the waitress accidently split the beer which did splatter the jacket. they offered to pay the dru cleaning bill. uitsmiljters were ordered which were fine. unfortunately the menu for lunch is rather small and not much to choose from. the plus point is if you park in the underground parking, they give you a parking card to drive out instead of paying the normal parking fee. definitely better than eating at the outlet,"
"ive been here a couple of times now and i truly believe it is a hit or miss situation here which largely depends on the mood of the staff that day. we popped by today for a latte and a cup of coffee. today wasnt our day, staff was cranky and eager to dismiss us as soon as possible. in addition for the prices i would expect a real latte. this was a machine pumped watered down cup of something that somewhat resembled a latte in taste. hubbys coffee was at least better than sludge he said. so in general if you want to pay too much for a limited menu, crappy service with a nice view then you should pop by de rede. will we go again? oh probably as location is ideal. ps dont even bother asking if any of their coffee drinks can be altered slightly, it all comes pre-made in a machine."
the food was nothing special. only the sateh was pretty good. waiters forgetfing the drinks and took almost 30 minutes before someone came for ordering the food. it was not very busy.

this harbor restaurant is a bit out of the way but the tasty dishes are a good reason for the 5 min drive out of the city centre. the interior is surprisingly modern and cozy. the staff is friendly but needs some more experience.

"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that ‘it’s an old hotel’ ‘you can leave if you wish’. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: “so my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink

basic food presented nicely. would not recommend for the food but the place and location is great. i think you can go here for drinks and snacks.
"a friend who lives here wanted to treat me to a special meal. love the outdoor seatings, service & decors especially the location in the old prison. we had the 4 dishes tasting menu. it was 3 meat and a fish dish. loved the fish and the duck but the starter a ‘steak tartar with raw egg york’ was a no for me. i eat everything except ‘raw meat’, i don’t mind it medium rare but raw with a raw egg york was too much for me. i appreciate the creative ideas. wished there were more seafood and vegetables."

"i think after a mention in the michelin guide they are chasing a star. however they need to look at their tactics. the menu is small and very experimental which is fine. however a good restaurant would have a fall back of more standard dishes. even the soup of the day was a cold one. if there is nothing you like the look of then there is no where to go. i had the ceviche and the salad for starter the raw fish was like eating oysters (which i love) but without the fresh taste of the sea and citrus. the salad had everything thrown in and a selection of all the sauces they do of all colours, not particularly enjoyable. my son had the goose which was supposed to come with a different salad but it looked the same to us. it was not much better than mine. we fell back on the dry aged ribeye because of the limited choice. it was okay standard steak, cooked ok. the bearnaise did not taste home made. sitting outside was okay, but no table cloth and the large black plastic numbers stuck on the tables did not help the ambiance. for desert i had the creme brulee which was very nice, and my son the panna cotta which was fine. he had lived in leeuwarden for a year and always wanted to visit this restaurant. he brought me as a treat and was disappointed it did not work out as expected. the service was ok but being one of the few outside we felt we were sometimes an after thought. a very average evening there are better in the town."
"we had nice drinks in the afternoon and reserved for an early dinner in the evening. when we reported reservation was not there but we got the table near the waterside. ordered directly and had drinks, after 30 min. we asked where the food was, sorry the kitchen starts as from 17.30. we had our food at 18.00 and the service was  not very dedicate "

"nice location and inside set-up. average service. got a hamburger and a fish, both not enough cooked."
we chose to have a meal here because my partner wanted to try frisian food. however i dont think the menu is at all frisian. they brought us sausage coated in white chocolate when we arrived. i am vegetarian so my boyfriend ate both. they then brought some bread with tapenade and some olive oil jelly. i am sure frisians are not eating this at home. during this time we still waited for the menu. it seemed odd to wait so long. my boyfriend chose a fish dish and i chose the only veggie opti 
the food was delicious but the wasabi wasnt spicy at all... the system they use for ordering food is super easy  menu is super clear and you can see exactly what u are ordering the tables were a bit small for the three of us
"a typical all you can eat restaurant, where you end up paying the same or more than in a classic restaurant. the decor is nice, attention to detail, the service is friendly, but not all dishes we ordered arrived, even after asking specifically for them. the quality of the dishes is very average. the sushi is like the ones you find ready made in supermarkets: rice that is too cold, fish with little taste."
"staff spoke good english, also had english menus which was nice. there was a slight misshap with our reservation even after 2 phone calls but eventually we got seated. the sushi was good, rest of the dishes were pretty average. would recommend the chicken satay with peanut sauce and the rib eye, both were pretty tasty. waiting time was good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you can get. "
"i was expecting more from this restaurant considering we had to make a reservation in order to eat on a saturday night. what i did not realize until my friend and i arrived, however, was that it is a fixed-price, all-you-can-eat sushi joint and not an actual sushi restaurant. if you are looking for great sushi, this is not the place for yo "
"tao is mediocre at best, its a sushi restaurant for people who have never had sushi before. the staff are not unfriendly or friendly, they just are, like being seved by an accountant.. you fill out want you want to order on a list and you dont get everything but they try and make you pay for all of it. the drinks are overpriced and slow. never again."
the restaurant has a one-choice formula. you can choose five times fives small dishes from the menu for a fair price. after three rondes yill discover that it may be enough alrea 
"it is full even on weekdays, and what i have noticed is that once the popularity was on, the quality of the food went down incredibly. nothing is fresh, and the quality of the fish is very poor. lots of items are frozen and then thrown into the fryer (and absolutely not part of the japanese cuisine). everything is salty in order for you to drink more. and it is not cheap at all! the atmosphere is nice and the service quite good and fast (of course). however not enough for the price they ask."
"this restaurant seems to be enjoying a bit of a hype at the moment but it cant live up to it. we dined at christmas and had to pay extra for a compulsary entree, but it was fish, so those of us that are allergic to fish basically paid for nothin "

"used to come here 3 times a year, this time i came with my girlfriend for a nice diner. we could pick our own table since we were reasonably early. after we sat down the waitress seemed tired or something, anyway we ordered some drink at first and looked into the menu card which had broad options. after decided what to eat we needed to wait 4 minutes for the waitress to notice us. we ordered carpaccio as starter that had some grilled cheese on it (odd combination) which had an overwhelming taste. after that we went for the main course, we took the rib-eye steak and spareribs (kinda cheesy food i know) food was reasonably fast at our table. while eating the waitresses had no eye for us anymore and couldnt get their attention for something to drink so had to wait 10 minutes before we could finally draw their attention. starter couldve been better, main course was nice but the employees werent capable of managing 10 tables with 3 waitresses. i used to enjoy the hospitality of the owner and his big smile but he was working at the bar unfortunately. "
"the only reason to come here is that it is cosy. old fashioned with lots of candles at night. however, the food is not great and the service is much too slow. i would not return. there are better choices out there. there are steep stairs to the bathroom. on the stairwell there is an old fashioned marble sink and a faucet. in the bathroom there are blaring commercials for this restaurant(!?)."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
the food was nothing special. the spare ribs were very dry. the environment was average. the stuff were friendly and polite.
"alright, this one isnt easy. let me start like this: we wanted to take the tapas all you can eat formula. after a while, we still didnt get any order lists or something alike, so we asked if we could order our food. seemed that the all you can eat part is eating what they give you. you do not have any choice in the matter at all...none of the waitresses gave us an information about the system when we got the menu, nor any descent explanation later from the boss. “we make everything fresh…” don’t they all?! the confusing part is this: nowhere on the menu or on the website they mention that the “all you can eat” formula isn’t free of choice. normally all you can eat is: all you can eat and you pick what you want to eat. i think it is reasonable to assume they work the same way. clearly not… so on to the next choice on the menu: the five tapas formula for 2 persons. here the same problem: you get the most sold tapas of the month, not the ones you want! soooo extremely frustrating. what if the most sold ones aren’t the ones you want?! i mean, seriously…at “la cubanita” you can order anything you want and as much as you like, now that is an: all you can eat formul "
i went there for dinner with coworkers and was totally grossed out. service is super slow. it took almost 10 minutes to get a menu. i only ordered a salad because i wasnt too hungry. when it came i took one bite and before i could take another i found a massive hairball in the salad. the manager offered me something else but of course i refused to eat anything else out of that kitchen. my coworkers said their food was ok but my experience ruined it. the bright side is the manager told me he didnt charge me for the salad...but he did charge me for the drink. 😐 would never recommend anybody eat there. 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description.

"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didn’t order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didn’t show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."
"i was accompanying my partner for a dinner date he had the planed for. he called to arrange a window view for a romantic sunset dinner, but the staff weren’t sure over the phone. when greeted at the restaurant, the seating was denie "
"a quick note. this review regards our visit to the christmas brunch on boxing day. i have added a half point as it might not exactly reflect their normal quality. however, as a draw for future guests it was an utter fai "
"yes, you can order a lot of tapas here. and yes, some them are great (e.g., spare ribs!). but the pace is soooo slow. we got our first order at the end of the evening. the all-you-can-eat means literally you can eat all you want, but its all about the drinks. even the drinks were not served very quickly. all in all a disappointing experience. but hey: try it for yourselves!"
"this restaurant is located in the centre of leeuwarden, so has a nice view if you sit outside. i would recommend sitting outside, because inside is cramped, dark and extremely warm. the food was ok, there was quite a lot of variety, but the quality really varied per dish. sometimes the dishes came really quickly, and some took half an hour! this makes it hard to predict exactly how much time you will spend at the restaurant. the staff was friendly and the concept of all you can eat tapas is a good one, so all in all an ok restaurant."
"the food was okay, lots of variety but not very good taste. you pay way too much for what you get. was kind of dissapointed.."
"called to get some good food. i heared itwas goodso we called to get some dishes. gado gado with white rice, tofu dish with vegetarian bami, baka bana/ baked bana "
only bad thing was we had to wait 30 mins even though we had ordened tables. food was fair and planty of it at fair prices.
"sushi all-in but the restaurant itself feels more romantic than an all-you-can-eat-concept normally is. it was a very busy night. the food is nothing special, had better sushi (i would recommend tao if you want the best sushi). the waitresses en waiters are friendly, but not very fast. sometimes we got the wrong dish, sometimes they forgot a dish or drink."
"the place is fancy and the waiters too. but the quality of the food is really terrible but its way too expensive, especially taking in consideration that it is an all you can eat and you can order only 3 very tiny portion per person, and moreover it takes ages to be served... absolutely to avoid! way better places where to eat! "
some friends suggested this place. we were in town and decided to try the take out. came home excited to try and we were very disappointed. not much flavor at all in any thing! not sure we want to go back and try the restaurant now. 
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
service was good but we were there with a huge group of women and we expected (as the sign said) different bites. the second course waa basically a big bowl of chicken wings. not spanish and 0 inspiration. sad thing. it used to be nice and fun to eat here. this was a shame. 
"i really can not understand why it took so long to get our food, it was a friday night but not at all busy, they got our orders wrong and it was not at all busy, which should have been a sign. the waiter was rude and unapologetic and basically had a crappy attitude. the food was tasteless and it was obvious that the cheapest of the cheap ingredients were used. please do not go to this waste of money. absolutely awful."
"i went to mei wah for dinner. the online presence suggested it should be an interesting place to visit. i do not speak dutch, but they found staff members to talk english with me. the menu was in dutch only, so i did need assistance. one of the staff members, who appeared to be one of the cooks, helped me by asking what type of foods i liked. as part of the discussion, i mentioned that while i like flavors, i do not like overly spicy/hot food. not liking hot food may have been taken literally! in any event, i was recommended a dish called bami super special, on the basis that it met my needs and that it was a favorite for many dutch diners. unfortunately, the food was mostly bland, lukewarm, and in partially congealed sauces. one of the deep-fried items appeared to be freshly fried. the other not. the meal was a disappointment. nobody came to check on me during the meal either."
"wed been looking for a place where we could eat fresh and good sushi for a while. yugo came as a pleasant addition to the relatively basic restaurant scene in sneek. we went in the weeks after it has just opened. yugo, a nicely-designed but reasonably noisy restaurant, goes for a fusion-type mix of cuisines - mostly asian-oriented. theres a great selection of sushi (they do take-out as well) plus small tapas-like dishes. there are two levels you can choose from, based on a number of rounds: standard and deluxe. in a number of rounds (5) you can pick dishes on the ipad on the table. our server tried to explain the procedure, but didnt seem quite sure how it worked either. that wast a good start. neither was the section of drinks: i wanted a special beer - no can do. staff, by the way, were very mostly friendly and helpful. everyone at the table must choose the same level. the deluxe level gives access to more exclusive plates but not to more plate "
"bar and restaurant are good places to be and eat. the bedrooms were large with an in room sink and kitchen cupboards, but no kitchen. we were cold both nights and could not find extra blankets. our toilet demanded that you sit sideways o it,no leg room except if one is vertically challenged. car parking a problem, not insoluble! staff were delightful."
"me, the wife and our 6month old baby were looking for a place to eat and according to tripadvisor this was one of the best in sne "
"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if we’d reserve a table for 6:30pm, we’d have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again. "
"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."
a group of sailor friends we went to the place last night. the food was just ok but the staff were so uninterested in helping us sort the menu out. we waited a long time to be served and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive. when we left there was no good b 
"we ate at this restaurant. it was well recommended by the locals but although the food was was ok, we, found the staff we more interested it ting and talking to their friends at another table than looking after us. there are better places in sneek"
"went with a large group, adults and children. they suggested grown up meals to the children, result a lot of wast "
it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"this evening we (a family of 5) stopped by this hotel restaurant because we always enjoy the van der valk menu. however, after being seated we were ignored for 10 minutes. i then went to pick up some menus myself so that we could choose our meals. however, a further 10 minutes passed and we were still completely ignored. we tried to call over a waiter to place our orders but no-one responded. finally we just left and went to another restaurant. so i cannot give a review of the food at this place because we never got any.

"we were a party of 10, some of us order first course. that was the strange part in the service, 3 people ordered the carpaccio and the waiter brought one portion at time and 10 minutes a part from each oth "

"on the 1st of january, we were looking forward to a nice evening with good food and service in a nice atmosphe "
"made a timely reservation for 20 people - birthday celebration - and received a phone call just the night before: we have to cancel; we made an error in your booking - try somewhere else - no sorry, no sympathy, no effort to reschedule - just basically get lost. never trust this place when you have an important event."
"there is place for 300 people i guess and it was almost full. the food is really nice, if they have it. they we out of chicken!!! 😳 the taste of the food was good but the portions were not all equal, some got a small piece some got a huge piece of meat, i would say the double. the tables are too big (for me it is more inportant that i can talk with the person in fron of me than the decoration of the table, that together with the noise make the place not as nice as it could be). but overall was good."
this is another van der valk restaurant with reasonable quality of food at a friendly price level. the splendid view over the adjacent lake is a bon 
"with me van der valk restaurants conjured up an image of a road side restaurant, where you could obtain a quick lunch or dinner for a reasonable price, with ample food of medium quality. added to the fact that i had not visited van der valk for more than ten years, i was surprised at the nicely appointed big restaurant inside the van der valk hotel in sneek. we dined there on friday evening and saturday evening. if i would only review the dinner experience of friday the review result would have been easily 4 points with something to spare. delicious food, friendly and dedicated service, a superb italian wine and a table in a quiet corner, who could ask for more. so, anticipating another splendid meal, we booked the same table for the saturday evening. however, the experience of this evening was less satisfactory. the entree was ok, but with the main course the problems started. never mind that the person who served us with the main course was very indifferent, almost rude and shoved the dishes on the table on any old spot without taking care that the we could reach the dishes without getting up from the table, but the big problem was the quality of the side dishes. the cauliflower was still frozen; the french fries and fried potatoes were obviously recycled. i really want to believe that food leftovers from the tables are not used again at van der valk but with this experience i start to wonder. we sent it all back to the kitchen of course but we marveled about the difference in quality between the friday and the saturday. also we wondered that those side dishes ever could have been approved in the kitchen. that is why my review is only three points and explains the mixed feelings. one really positive observation i want to share is that every table received fresh linen after it was cleared! this is the standard in italy of course but in dutch restaurants the table linen is virtually glued to the table and gets only a superficial brush down after the table is cleared. high marks for van der valk in this area. the price of the food is of course of the inflated dutch variety, but in moderation. dutch restaurants have the highest prices in europe, but here at van der valk the prices are moderate for dutch standards. conclusion: mixed feelings and hit or miss."
"a week ago, after an excellent dinner and friendly service, we made a reservation for a table for the consecutive sunday. unfortunately we made the opposite experience on our second visit: no table available outside at the time agreed, unfriendly and arrogant behaviour by the « cheffe » (style: couldn’t care les "
"we selected this restaurant based on its high rating in google maps. the service is very good but the pizza is average. the dough is good and crunchy but the topping is disappointing, very little amount of cheese. i was expecting more."
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an ‘i told you we were busy’. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"decent spanish tapas style restaurant, allbeit the portions are quite big for a “real” tapas experience. fair prices and mostly fresh ingredients. the terrace is right at the roadside, so there could be some cars passing."
"the quality of the food is good for what you pay, the place is nice and you can spend some lovely time there with friends or even for an informal business dinner. i will come back since i liked the concept and the service."
"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
"i put average on my review because of the decor and the friendliness of the staff; however, the culinary experience was not for us a big succe "
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had saté. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "
"we were in 20 people, ordered different dishes, starters and desserts. i ordered risotto with forests mushrooms and.. it was really bad risotto with champignons.. and frozen asparagus. bad taste, too salty. forests mushrooms only from bullion cube. not worth that price. my boyfriend ordered duck, which was also not so tasty. too chewy and without duck tas "

the restaurant looks very nice (i was staying in the hotel) and the staff is dressed very smart. had the signature dish the short ribs. presented very nice but for my taste there was to much fat and to little real meat. the freshnstrawberry and ice cream dessert was good! prices are reasonable.
"i have no idea what happened, but what used to be a really nice restaurant has really gone downhill."

"we visited this restaurant many times between 2003 and 2006 under the name of la palette and were supporters, when fire stopped their operation. restarted as la niche in 20.. and the first time we had a bad experience, cold atmosphere and not creative food. learned recently that new management had taken over since 2 years and positive news, so try aga "
"it was a first time for us that we were going to a van der valk restaurant; it is a very big restaurant, service is friendly and quick...the food is less that average (i ate better in some dutch snack-bars..), but what shocked us was the moment when the waiter brought our bottle of bordeaux to our table already opened...apparently the restaurant manager had ordered to have the bottles of wine already opened this because not all young serving staff did get a proper horeca training. that was a first even in the netherlands (after 33 years leaving here.. :-) ) "
note: we ate here as part of our arraignment with the hotel de cathar

"we arrived at the restaurant and had no reservation. it tok about five minutes before someone from the staff noticed us. we asked foir a table for two and that was no problem, even we had no reservation. it took a while (again) before they gave us the menu. we orderd something to drink and that took nearly ten minutes before we get something. after that everything seems to go smoother, but the gap between the apatizer and the main menu was hughe. thats why we doubt to order a dessert. we desided to order it and now there was a normal gap between the main menu and the dessert. we desided not to go there again and for sure not with guests"
"first of all i want to under-mark, that since many years we regularly visit restaurant de cantharel - both for buffet as for live cooking and ala carte me "
"nice atmosphere, friendly staff. didnt listen very well to our order. we asked the childrens steak to be prepared well done but received it very raw. side dish to my salad never arrived. not much attention from staff once our food was served. food itself was oke, not spectacular but reasonable quality for the price we paid."
"whether it is because of the low ceilings, but dinner in this restaurant was not really a pleasant affair.  the food is good but the atmosphere in and the ambiance of the restaurant did not do it for us on this occasion."
"purely for food and dining experience, i would rate this place 3 points, average. but because of all the dogs they allow inside, i cannot rate this place more than 2 points. i will not retu "
"i had lunch here with a former co-worker. when we arrived and found a table, we ordered our drinks and asked for the menu. after getting the drinks, we still had no menu, so after another 5 minutes we tackled another waitress to ask again for a menu. when we ordered our food the appliance the waitress used already had problems. food came quickly and was fine. as the waitress removed our plates we immediately asked for the bill as my friend needed to get back to the office and had only 15 minutes left untill her meeting. we waited for at least 10 minutes and still had no bill, so we decided to get up and find a check-out option. the waitress asked if we had already gotten a receipt: no we didnt, we asked for one 10 mins ago and nothing... she would check it out. she came back and said that our order could not be found in the computer, so another employee came, wrote down our order and had to input it in the computer again. by that time my friend was already too late for her meeting. after about 15 mins we finally got our bill and could pay. what irritated me most what that we got no apology whatsoever. no discount, no coupon for next time.. nothing."
had a good lunch with a business relation. nice waiter who almost works there for 25 years. we ate some eggs and had some coffee. everything fine. tables are close to each other in certain areas of the restaurant so would not go there for a romantic dinner.
"together with some friends we tried this place, well thats once. food came out frozen out of the microwave, and were glad that we didnt got sick."

"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "
"being the most busy terrace at the square, we choose for jules verne. a friendly guy guided us to our table, which he cleaned with a wiping cloth. during our dinner we learned that this wiping cloth doesnt get cleaned! he used it at every table time after time "
"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"the food is excellent, but.. what a pity that the restaurant is on a top day fully booked.. and the tables are cramped.. the people you see are people who you find normally in snackbars.. and are not really appreciating good food...the price of the wines is 3times what you pay in the stores.. and that is what i find a rip of.. but there is plenty of staff and they really do their best.. so what is wrong with us?? we think the chef deserves a better clientele... and guest who are willing to pay more and have some more space.."
"was not good,we eated in this restaurant but atmosphere and food was totaly not real italian.we are use to eat and be served much better in italy"
"the food was pretty decent, however a request to receive a table at the window wasnt honored, even though many tables were available. they told us these tables were reserved for groups of 6 or larger and we were a party of 4. not even 5 minutes later one was given to a party of 3. on request we received tap water with our wine, however when we asked for a second carafe of tap water they told us they would have to charge us for it."
went here with a group of friends (approximately 15). our orders were given to the wrong people and it resulted in a lot of confusi 
"many times i was told that yume is the best japanese restaurant in apeldoorn. so i was looking forward to eating there. unfortunately it was disappointing. the food was at best average. the taste, the quality and the freshness. all in all not very japanese. there are much better choices in apeldoorn for this kind of food."

"came with a group, our company fills at least two tables here each evening. put us on a table that was way too small. did not want to solve this, needed some heavy persuasion to get an extra chair that was given with a manner than can only be described as contempt. foodwise, i had the seasonal menu, first course was average and common, main course was a good piece of meat but with far more salt than needed for this quality, dessert again was not special. "
"the quality of the food is good: i had the deep fried mushrooms with herb-cream sauce as a starter and it was a good as i remembered. main dish grilled salmon with risotto. nice piece of salmon, grilled to perfection: very moist and tender. the portions are not huge and i think the prices are a bit high. for 2 people having both just 2 courses (of which for 1 person it was even a summer special menu for 24 euro), some bread to start and a total of 3 glasses of wine and 1 coffee, i think 75 euro is a bit over the top. therefore, the rating average."
we visit this restaurant on a sunday in december.  the restaurant was very nice decorated in x-mas style.. is was fully booked.  good  food and  great service.  the time betweem the different courses of the menu was too long.as a result of the many guests.
this is a restaurant since 1993 in an old buildi 
"the offered food is indeed very good, not cheap. the offered menu;s are too small and far to expensive for those little portions. staff is friendly and the service is ok."
we were there with seven friends and had a fine dinner and a good time! the place is small but nice. normal prices.
"waited 45 minutes for appetisers to arrive. after 1 hour and 40 minutes our main courses had still not arrived so we paid our bill and left. the place was busy but this was really unacceptable - it appeared that the kitchen could not keep up with the number of diners, who are packed into the restaurant with very little space. the appetisers we had reflected the menu, rather old-fashioned heavy french food, and the bread served at table was stodgy white supermarket style baguette. disappointing!"
was there for the first time and invited by a friend. the regular cook seems to be ill for a long time and the kitchen is managed by juniors it seems not knowing how to fry ossenhaaspuntjes. the aspergus soup was fine and the cheese as desert ni 
price-quality fair. due to misunderstanding (....) we have waited more than an hour for starters. nice ambiance. recommended.
i ate here. it looked cute and it was very busy. 
i had a business dinner in this restaurant. outside was terribly cold with snowy. but i liked athmosfer in this place with kind waiters..
"we called in for a dinner before we crossed the road to the theater. the food is allright, but when in a hurry the quality of the food might differ from time to time. the service is good and fast!"
"the staff kicked my husband only because he is from russia, and said it to him!!! we were very surprised, it was the fist time to hear this!!!"
will not come again. 
"nice place, cosy atmosphere, friendly service. food too much adapted to dutch taste, at least that is how we experienced it when ordening szechuan."
"after a recommendation from our hotel we visited this place and were assured it would be good food. i ordered strips of chicken but unfortunately the chicken tasted very greasy and poor quality so my plate was left full at the end of the meal. i would have given this place a 1 off my own experience but my friend managed to eat his, despite finding it lacking in flavour (chicken curry). cant say i can recommend this place and i was v surprised to see this place so highly rated on here!"
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
"the food at parthenon was far too salty, not big on seasonings, and over-priced for what you got. the atmosphere is nice and the staff competent, but the food left a lot to be desired. if you want good greek food in the netherlands, make the effort to go to akropolis restaurant in alphen aan den rijn."
"as lovers and consumers of greek food on a regular basis, i could say that although the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was good and friendly, the food was mediocre. no real greek taste to anything, nothing traditional, just very plain tasting dishes. also quite pricey for a greek restaurant! the tzatziki had no bite to it, there was no pita or oven bread available, desert was dull and tasteless and the meat and sea food had nothing greek about them. disappointed - will not return!"
"after a business meeting i went to this restaurant france atmosphere. the weather was good so choose to sit outside. food, they only serve 3 course menus started with escargo, it was salty like the north sea! too oily garlic butt "
"food was ok. the service was fast but the staff mentioned some new rules, so the beverages cannot be shared and there cant be water bottles on the table if they werent purchased there. they said that there are cameras and a lady checking if we are following those rules.. that was a little bit weird to hear. we were lucky to arrive before the rush hour: there was a queue for entering and a queue for paying. "
"this retsaurant has good pricing. regular dish at about 10 euro. food is asian style and quality is fine, not good or perfect. anlot of young people here. gluten free options are availabke here. if you search for a good and cheap dinner this is a good place to go to. not cosy but still okay. "
"yesterday night we went to dadawan with two friends visiting from germany. i praised the place highly to them. so they went with high expectations. but it started quite badly as they served bed wine to one of us. the wine smelled and tasted bad and acidic as if it went sour. he told a waiter who was merely a kid of 17 or 18 i think, very kindly to place the wine. and also the kimchi which was so salty that it was not even easy to eat. the kid started giving us stares through the whole time. and even though we returned one glass of one and two bowls of kimchi, they counted everything in the bill and we paid it without saying anything because it became already too bitter experienc "
"walked into arnhem at around 9:00 pm and was greeted by several restaurants that they stop serving at 9:00 pm. ok it was a monday in late october, but fair play to the dadawan, they were willing to serve us but made it clear when they would need the last orders by. so we ate. the burger was huge - a clear korean speciality and the hot stone dishes were very hot indeed. and loved the brand beer."
"portions are huge, hence beware of the number of dished you order. we had a chicken curry rice (mediocre) and noodle soup with chicken and vegetables followed by a fresh fruit platter. i would not recommend the chicken curry rice. the rest was ok."
"although the food is of good quality, the portions are very small, taking the high price into account.  furthermore, its clear that because of cutting costs, hardly any side dishes are being served. conclusion, good food, but very expensive.l and small portions."
the food is mediocre but expensive. the waitress was very rude to us and the other waite 
"perhaps we came at the wrong time; late for lunch and a tad too early for dinner! the place was crowded, but we were offered a table for two. the breakfast/lunch menu was on offer, but apart from salads, there was limited gluten free choice. i ended up with the dutch pea soup, which was very good, except for the fact that on a separate place they still offered me bread! half way through eating our meal, the menus were changed for the evening, so although i did not look at this menu, perhaps we should just have had a drink first and then waited before ordering a meal! nice place to sit and watch the world go by!"
"i was looking forward to trying out the food in this place for quite some time. i went with a group of friends just before the dinner service started with the idea to have a drink first and order food a bit later. we wanted to sit outside, but the available tables had no chairs (people from neighboring tables took them away), so we sat inside. no one came to show us to seats or to greet us (the staff was going around us, as if we were in their way). we sat on the table and waited for about 20 minutes before someone came to take an order. we had our drinks and waited for someone to come to collect food order, but no one did. we paid and lef "
we had just the worst food ever! big lia 
"great location, close to the station. nice in- and outdoor seating with friendly staff. we both had the ribs tasting platter, so 4 flavors. the meat was well cooked but out of the 4 i had, i really only liked one (classic). the others werent very special in taste but my friend had different ones and liked them. on monday, wednesday and thursday they do a -ribs, fries and salad-deal for €12,50. oh and on a good summer day, go for ice cream next door :)!"
"very nice atmosphere, great service. however, portion sizes are way too small. the dishes are definitely interesting but nothing crazy. by the 5th course i’m still not full. going to have to stop by mcdonalds on the way home to eat something substantial."
"this meal was a joke. we paid eur 90 per person for a 5 course meal (i use this term loosely) with wine pairing. normally i would not find this amout unreasonable, however if you totalled the weight of the 5 courses we were served, it came out to perhaps 150grams of food per person. i realize that nouvelle cuisine is often served in small portions but this was an insult. unfortuanley the wine portions were equally small. this was a tasting, not a meal! luckily they served free bread. the tastings were interesting and if you feel compelled to go to this restaurant, make sure you eat before you go."
"ordered take-out, beef with rice dish. tasted great but felt like overpaying for the amount of beef. ratio was like 80-20 on the rice."
nothing special. the food was ok and so were the drinks. it looks cooler in the pictures than in reality. the prices are relatively high and the portions quite small.
"the balance between price and food quality has dropped to an all time low. not only food preparation (burned, over cooked) as well as ingredients (stove meat is not supposed to be used for sate)."
the atmosphere is nice and the staff was super friendly. they explained about the menu and how the tablet for ordering food and drinks wo 
"had a few drinks, 3/4 we needed to ask when they would arrive, small food platter did not make it to the table"
there is no warm welcome here. they treat you as if you are doing them a favour. i work in the town with a group of colleagues and we tried to eat here four times and have succeeded only once because they chose to close the kitchen whenever they want and it’s not at all consistent with their published opening times. even when we did manage to sit they were far from pleasant.
having had excellent food here a number of times we got to see a very different side of rung this ti 
friendly service. good choice and good indication on spicyness of the meals. tasty but averidge.  would go there again
"i went to this restaurant alone after a long day of helping move my sons stuff while he was on introduction week. when i said table for one the reception was rather cold and i did not feel welcome. however during the meal the staff was actually nice and at the end even the owner tried to be friendly. the restaurant is very pretty, cosy and well decorated. the food and the service were a bit of a disappointment. i ordered fish cakes and chicken curry. the fish cakes were on the table in 2 minutes. they were tasty but missed the delicacy of great thai food. there were presented in big chunks and with far too much oil. then i waited 30 min for the curry! the portion was very generous (actually what i ordered was enough for 2 people) but again the balance of flavours was off. very meaty lacking the beautiful contrasts of tangy and cocconut creamy that make this dish memorable. it could be a jewel: the atmosphere is very nice, the portions generous and the ingredients fresh. but the quality of the cooking and the disorganized service let it down."
i have visited rung many times over the last 6 years whilst traveling to arnhem. in general have always found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. i have arranged two large parties for dinner here and again not been disappointed by the food or the servi 
"of all the 4 indonesian restaurants in town, lestari definitely is the most cosy and classy of the bunch with great location near the river banks where you can have a relaxing walk after your meals. however, it is also the most expensive, let down by poor service and bland taste in their food. this restaurant has potential to be the best in town as it has an impressive menu and food presentation which are only let down by their waitresses and cooks."
the interior of the restaurant is just outdated and it looks ready for renovation. i was disappointed by the quality of the food and the lack of passion that apparently went into it.we had a caprese which was unexciting and a tournedos which vos reasonable but not superb that the winds were fine and the waiter took time to explain the origin 
"not amazed, was a normal pizza and pasta, not special. don’t understand why this is nr1 on tripadvisor. pizza was good but really standard, pasta with truffle was no fresh truff "
"not worth the money, 14 euro for a tiny portion of mediocre lasagna is not worth it.  the ragu (bolognese) isnt seasoned properly. and lacks flavor.   i am really disappointed. i expected a lot more."
"an italian restaurant with a good atmosphere in arnhem centre, immediately near the shopping area. we enjoyed good pasta and nice fish, nothing wrong with that. but i found the prices rather exaggerated (my main course was 24,50 for a good piece of fish, two half potatoes, one small tomato etc. not quite enough for this sort of price. tasty bread was charged extra, a 75cl bottle of sparkling water at 5,75. i mean, come on.) staff were very friendly and helpful, though."
"we came back after 10 years. the food is still the reason to come here. dont mind the 70ties interior. the service is not italian, the people didnt find the right approach and our waiter was topping up our glasses too often, which felt unpleasant. we missed the italian hospitality."
"we had dinner here in april. my daughter had a vegetarian option, i had a rib-eye steak. the food was good but overpriced and service was leisurely."
"was ok, staff is very friendly but the portions were huge and the food was quite salty and all tasted the same. we had a family style dinner and it tasted unremarkable."
"we were with a group of 8 and they suggested a shared platter. the amount of food they brought was ridiculous, it was way to much! food was ok but bland. we were full after the first course and the second course was even more. in the end the bill came to over 500 euro for 8 people. way to much. "
in this restaurant you can have a good greek meal. lunch or dinner. it is a cosy restaurant for families and coupes.
"i have been there on the first night of my stay in arnhem. functional position, just few steps away from the station.  souvlaki just tasted normal. the place is a bit too tawdry for my taste.  average prices."
"visited with grandparents and teens. we all could chose and ate with pleasure. greek is about cheese, thats what i remember most. and there s a limit for me. but that is my taste."
"took ages to get menus and food. no wine list-beware they have a choice of 2 red ,2 white or ro "
"the ambience in very nice. the wines delicious, but the food and the service very poor. the service is very slow, i guess because they dont have enough waitresses. the food is standard, nothing special."
we went here on the recommendation of our conscierge. the food was tasty butte portions mean for the money.  the service was slacker than id have expected given the feel the restaurant had. i hate to have to continually ask for refills and water.
"ive been to stir-fry buffet restaurants before, and this is a typical exampl "
"this is a dutch-chinese eating hall. the food is good, not the most culinary or the best you will ever have. but go there with friends and pig-out on lamb-chops or on steak from the grill. but know where you are going, this is a food factory. there is little atmosfere and it is not traditional, but a good place to earn the meat-sweats. the service in the drinks department is a bit lacking but a fun place to visit."
such a terrible restaurant ever. the service is 4/10. food: 3/10: choice limited => i would never eat there again
"we went with 4 friends to eat some tapas at la puerta. it take a considerable time before you get something to eat or drink. once they served the dishes, most of these dishes seemed like these were not freshly prepared or the dishes were cold. the only that makes this restaurant interesting is the location, the basements of arnhem."
the food is good here and a nice price. but i would prefer la cubanita (not so far away from this restaurant) to eat tapas.
"great for sharing food. most of it was nice, but used to be better. i was really looking forward to the spareribs, unfortunately they were a bit dry. but other than that, it was a great night out."
"slightly off the tourist track, this is a cosy restaurant worth trying if you fancy an italian. service was a little slow at times (hence the 3/5 score), but it was a very relaxed experience and the food was cooked well. i had the rigatoni all’arrabiata - delicious. very good value."
"the food at zafvino has always been great - along with the wines and wonderful antipasti, nothing to complain about. i think zafvino should consider to limit the amount of guests on the terrace if they want to keep the quality of their service hi "
"we made a reservation for indoors but turned up early for a drink beforehand. although there seemed to be many available tables outdoors under shelter where we would have been happy to sit in the meantime, we were offered a seat at a table apart, halfway in the rain. declining this, we left and returned for our meal; however, it didn’t seem they were expecting us, despite our arrival 45 minutes earlier. they offered us a place on bar-stools, while again, there were tables indoors available. when we asked to move, we were given a table near the entrance, where people were stood waiting to be seated. in these times of social distancing, this did not seem appropriate. we opted to leav "
"bustling restaurant, busy, nice atmosphere. we were allocated a spot where you practically needed a torch to see your food - extremely dark. moved - “that’s better...” wine was good! but waitress forgot half our food order. food took ages to arrive. difficult to get attention of waitresses. very frustrating. cos otherwise the place isn’t bad "
zafvino is one of my favourite places in arnhem however tonight i was quite disappointed by the services. it was full of young service (nothing wrong with that) only they were not attentive and there seemed to be no senior staff around. it’s not a bargain place so service should be to par it would be a shame that such an amazing wine and food place losses clients because of an easily solved problem. you can do better zafvino 
poor food poor service. the location is ok but the food is less than on would expect. service is poor asked for some extra bread never arrived.  perhaps for the best . not a place to sit and relax.
"arrogant service and presumptuous attitude. asked to see the wine list to be told there was not one and that the waiters were the wine list. upon asking, limited or no knowledge of italian wines. they claim to be an italian restaurant. food was average to good and the ambience was nice. its just a pity that the service dampens the overall quality of the evening. will not go there again."
"probably i was really unlucky, but my experience with this place was very ba "
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."
"if you do not like the combination of rare french fries with mayonaisee, do not go to this restaurant. again, we have the reunie and we spent tea time, lunch and dinner at tr "
"we were five: two adults, one child and two babies. the service at the beginning was pretty good, the waiter explained everything but the main course came after 30 minutes. the waiting was too much since we ordered steak, fish, two chicken nuggets and the restaurant was empty. only  "
"in this small street there is this restaurant with two separate locations. we were in the garden, so nice! the staff is friendly and attentive."
"i normally love this place, great atmosphere and food. yesterday we went there with friends. the food was good but the service and staff where terrible! from the start we got the feeling of not being welcome. cold staff, candles where not replaced and they started cleaning around 2230 hrs (vacuum cleaner put in sight etc). i hope it was a one off... "
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
"the ambiance is good, they have a terrace with a nice view over the rive "
the service was so poor we ended up leaving early. the last 2 orders were not put through which was 8 dishes. at 9.45pm we were told they were just getting to it but it was too late. a shame as my husband left hungry!
we had to wait for more than 1 hour until our first order arrived. the placed orders after that were not much better. we didn’t receive all we are ordered and also some incorrect dishes. we had to go to the bar to ask for silverware and they had to find from dirty plates and clean it. it seems the have serious staffing problems. we used to go there frequently but will stay away for some time until they have sorted out their problems.
"visited here in april for a sushi meal. basically pay for what you order and if you order too much and cannot eat it, you still pay. varying price options according to which menu you choose from. the food was good, but have had better sushi. service friend, polite and helpful. limited drinks choice. limited gluten free options."
"basic sushi quality. a bit better than other allyoucaneat places, but thats about it. the staff was friendly - although they forced us to buy drinks under the pretext that it was mandatory. after searching in their house rules, we didnt find any rule regarding this. its a large place with a commercial ambience. "
"this is your famous all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, but then just a bit better for the same price. they now even have a all-you-can-drink menu €10,-, im a fan! the menu for the sushi or grill is also a bit better i find then at other sushi places."
"the place is nice and cosy. you can have good all you can eat sushi. friendly staff, definitely i good place if you want to experience sushi!"
"good variation on the menu, friendly staff, quick service - good value for money. i especially enjoyed the desert menu, they had some good options in small portions so you could try out a lot."
"its about quantity, not about quality, even though it is a large restaurant with little atmosphere, the crew is very friendly and wellwilling. avrrage sushi for a very reasonable price."
"i would like to be able to give sushi koi a better review. most of the sushi i ordered as part of the all you can eat lunch was tasty, some were really good and i reordered these twice or even 3 times. in particular maki sushi rolls or wraps featuring roe from flying fish or salmon were delectable, as was the white fish nigiri, i think it was dorado or sea bass... the futomaki was different from the norm that is vegetarian with maybe sweet egg omelette; in addition to veggie strips it had salmon and a layer of roe as its outer garnish, and it was huge. two hand rolls i ordered were meh, so i didnt try more than two given the fine other optio "
"just awfull.... fast food .. bad service, wine no thanks: dont need a headache and the bill is just a happy moment because you can leave.."
"we visited this place 17 february 2015, and it was ok. very big restaurant, looks well managed. not the best sushi weve had though. we were surprised that sashimi was included in the price, but sadly it was very thick sliced and there were a lot of fishbones in it (4 fishbones in 3 portions is a lot, i think). the rest of the sushi was ok, but there was not a lot of choice i think. the dragon roll was the best for me. however, i really didnt like some of the combinations, like salmon maki with garlic/herb cream cheese, or the wakame salad with corn and pine nuts (this was disgusting). i did like that the dessert was included as well, especially the deep-fried sweet bun was very good. unfortunately the coconut pudding was split and tasted like other things from the fridge (yuck "
"the first thing you are told when you enter this place is the all you can eat concept... and that you will be fined if you dont finish a dish. they say to stop people ordering more than they can eat but you end up feeling more like a naughty child than a valued customer. some of the food was very good. particularly the sashimi and the miso soup. some not so good, like the sushi with tinned fish. service and friendliness lacking. we also got charged for side dishes as we left, though it wasnt clear at the beginning that these items were not included in the all you can eat price. a so so experience i thought."
"we liked this place more when it was chinese muur but since they re-styled and re-branded to renao we decided we will not return. its a pitty, real "
"the restaurant is comfortably situated near the openlucht museum. parking available, an attractive terrace and lots of green around. the staff is very friendly, the food served is ok, they offer some pleasant dishes you dont find in the average chinese restaurant. the taste is adapted to the european guests, a reminder of asia. a good place to invite people, a place to come back to."
"probably the worst meal i have had in arnhem. i order the prawns to start, and received a very small shrimp in sauce dish for 9.95 euro. at bill time i was asked how the meal was, i explained the starters was disappointing, the response was its shrimps, you should have looked at the menu better. the menu states in de oven gebakken garnalen met een groente roomsaus which to me translates to prawns. and at 9.95 euros prawns is what are to be expected. never to return. "
"came here with my husband and dad, but this time the standard dropped. the food is dull and all we liked was the bread with sauce. disappointed with the results. will think twice to come back. this was our favourite turkish restaurant as i have been there for many years. "
"we went there on a saturday night, not too busy and a very good service. the restaurant looks beautiful with its classic atmosphere, the food on the other hand is good but not amazing, i didnt enjoy too much the pasta crepes (if i had read the menu with more attention i wouldnt have taken the risk) while the picassos chicken had a perfect sauce with an amazing flavor, but the chicken itself was not cooked good enough. my girlfriends dishes were looking better to be hones "
have used this bistro many times in the past when coming to arnhem for the para reunion...but tonight the food was awful...the service was really bad..i have always recommended this place to others...but not no more and i will not be returning in the future.
"if you want something that tastes worse than the cafeteria around the corner and pay about the same.. go here. dry (to long baked) meat, burned and/or overcooked sides.. for simple dishes i can cook at home i expected more. got a glass of wine thrown over me and an apology would not have been misplaced. ive been here a second time to not misjudge the first visit, what a waste of time and money... there are far better restaurants in arnhem that are actually worth visiting, skip this one if you want a descent night out!"
"on monday the 3rd of august my wife and i decided to have dinner at momento. it looked nice and it wasnt very busy, so we expected a quick service. how wrong were we! okay, they were quick with the drinks, but after ordering the food it all went down hill. we ordered a pea soup and beefburger for me and a vegan burger for my wi "
do not trust open hours information. came at 21:00 and they decide to close the kitchen sooner. neither the attendant could explain why. not trustworthy
"we called in to momento for a snack. the restaurant is large, new and very modern. the food was ok and the prices were very reasonable. however, there is no character or atmosphere in the restaurant – it reminded me of eating in a motorway service station café!"
"decent place, ideal when you decide last minute to have dinner with a larger group of friends. large restaurant, but always animate "
we found this place open for dinner within 5 blocks of the city center on a busy evening and it turned out to be more of a tapas style restaurant where you can order a few items to share except it had a limited menu with very entre ite 
"having ordered oyster rockafella to start then pork and salad, i waited 1 hour to have the salad arriv "
"we went for lunch but a lot of things in the menu you need to pay more to orde. for example de edamame beans. there is only one dessert included in the menu: fried banana, all the others you need to pay extra. i will not go again!"
"horrible service and unfriendly staff. food was okayish, but there are better sushi/japanese restaurants in arnhem!"
was looking for a way to order and a specific meal. women on the phone was very rude. started sighs after i askes a question. based on this way of contact i wont want to order or eat there again.
"i’ve been to different restaurants of sumo but this one was not so good we ordered drinks and it took them ages, some sushi didn’t taste very well and the noodles were uncooked!"
"this is your typical sushi all you can eat dinner or lunch. the service is semi okay, but not personal. the taste of the food is okay, but not specia "
came to sumo for good sushi. wasnt exactly up to my expectations. its an all you can eat restaurant. so do not come here if youve eaten before and make sure to have at least 50 euros in your pocket. sushi is okay. not exactly the best quality but pretty decent. service is really fast even with a full house. also staff was fast to clean the tables which is good.
"the presentation is nice. the service was quick, but other than a few rolls, like the spicy tuna, the salmon with wasabi mayo, the dishes were mediocre and sometimes seem to be smoothered in bottled sauces. the tuna and salmon tartar were generous portions but the fish was tasteless. two other unpleasant surprises: 1. no sashimi dishes are included, for any sashimi dish one has to pay extra somewhere between 3 and 12.5 euros per dish. 2. there is no selection of dutch beers, only expensive japanese beer or bavar "
although the food is decent and the prices are reasonable i dont like the fact that i am allowed to stay at the restaurant for up to (not even) 2hours and be in a rush. this is not enjoyable.
"the all you can eat formula and the food tastes ok, it is usually very busy do booking a good idea, there is also another restaurant around the corner with same firmula which us better"
"we have been waiting for 30 minutes and nobody came to help us, so i went inside and a blond girl said they were full while they were not( a lot of free tables) . all the people there were waiting for a waiter to come , and few tables needed to be cleaned up. horrrible service, it’s not worth it. they don’t want to wor "
"food was extremely salty, and a certain staff member was very rude. we bought two bottles of water, and two soft drinks, but then didn’t want to buy another bottle so drank from the water bottle we already had on us, but the waitress came over to tell us off. i’ve never experienced this before where tap water wasn’t available for free, and then to be told off for not buying another overpriced bottle of tap water. maybe if the food was less salty we wouldn’t have needed to. also maybe speaking with guests in a respectable tone would have been better than shouting rudely at "
"been here with housemates and it was something i would regret  awful service, they wont stop confusing tables. food is mediocre, it gives you the feeling you can do it yourselves but better) for €25,- go somewhere else like pinocchio or beren (bears)."
"hadnt been here for a while, they changed the seating a bit. its quite cozy, dimmed lights. its fun that you can write on the walls but its been done so much that it looks messy now. the first couple of tapas were nice, very tasty. i didnt like that some of the portions were really small, others were quite big for one person to eat. and towards the end the tapas we ordered didnt taste very nice and were a bit dry. not sure that it was because it was towards the end or because thats just how they are. also, my friend wanted a glass of wine and they gave him two choices, only to later discover there was also a cheaper house wine we didnt know about so well done on their side, but not very friendly towards the customers. all in all for the price you pay, its alright. no time limit and unlimited tapas. theres quick service and its okay if you dont finish the tapas, they dont charge extra for it. perfect idea for groups to share food."
we went there at 4.30 pm and they told us it opens at 5 so we waited till 5 and went it again however then they told us we had to make a reservation or wait another hour to get a table. even though there were lots of tables free. would not recommend because of the bad service we got without even eating there. 
tapas were hard to order and understand the menu. we ended up eating several things we did not order. and the place is noisy and hot as hell. and walls with hand writing on them. should have been a clue as to the grade of the food and service. one friend had a panic attack from the noise and crowd..
"went here on a monday evening. the location is good, in the centre of the city. inside its cramped with small tables and narrow spaces between them. the walls are filled with texts from previous guests, i really disliked this and i cant imagine anyone being enthusiastic about these decorations. the service in the restaurant was a bit random, the waiting staff just seemed to walk around without any plan. we didnt have to wait particularly long for drinks/food but no one seemed to be bothered to clean the tables around us which emphasized the trashed feeling in this restaurant (e.g. ~45 minutes to clean up a table after 1 couple had paid!? "
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"we chose from the special 3-course-menu. choice is not exciting. however, the food is good. next time ill choose from the menu."
"we came here as a family of four for high tea on mothers day. after being seated, we waited for a full 30 minutes before getting served a small bowl of soup each. another 45 mins later and after asking the server twice when we were getting the next dishes, we finally got our food. the server practically threw the plates on the table and disappeared without explaining what the items were. i overheard another waitress for the table next to us telling the guests what each of the food items were so it was disappointing we werent extended the same courtesy. also our high tea wasnt served on tiered platters as i expected, which detracted from the whole experience. (i asked when we paid why we didnt get our food on the tiered serving platter and the waitress said they ran out of them). we werent asked once during eating if everything was ok, if the food was nice etc. i understand it was busy but this was unacceptable. the service was subpar to say the least. such a pity as the surroundings in the park are beautiful and the food was reasonable. the white asparagus soup was very tasty. we wont be returning."
"the slow stew roasted pork was dry, the tuna was like defrosted tuna from a supermarket and the duck was also dry and i’m not a professional cook but i can cook same food better. i think this restaurant is very overpriced. "
"recently weve had diner with 12 people in one of the separate rooms. the menu was oke, nothing special. it felt like a 13 in a dozen one. at the same time there was a wedding party which they need to serve. we had to do our own drinks, organizing the table setting etc "
"made a reservation for lunch. there happend to be some miscommunication and instead of properly handle it, the staff was rude and not helpful."
busy place on this nice april sunday afterno 
"not a bad place especially when the sun is out on the terrace. it looks ambitious but is a little would be, service very wellwilling but not very experienced and no eye for the table. getting attention for wine and water was really anneffort. food is good but not surprising. price on the high end."
"this lovely spot is no longer accessible for us, as the staff will only give people access if they dine. and if you are in a wheel chair: shame on you, but sorry, can not accomodate you -even on the terrace-! heard this three times on different occasions. a disgrace to arnhem!"
"de boerderij is a very nice location next to the park sonsbeek, in a fabulous surrounding. the restaurant personally visited and known for over 30 years, has changed several times from ownership, management, whatsoever. the quality hasnt been always as superb as it has been in the early days, but this place for its entourage is really worth your visit. nowadays when lucky you can enjoy an excellent dinner ."
"the boerderij is located on the edge of sonsbeek park in arnhem, a truly stunning setting with a great terace for outside dinners, dutch weather permitting. i have had dinner here a couple of times over the last year. the interior is a nice mix between authentic farmhouse features in a contempary design. funny though how the comfortable chairs seem to a few inches too low to sit at the table properly. the staff is an interesting mix between the regular management and some youngster who really try hard. management seem to have lost the real desire to give you a superb guest experience. the menu offers traditional choices, in the autumn often a variety of game. allthough the food is well prepared it is a basic or perhaps i should say safe choice of ingredients. well prepared and good quality, but not very exciting. the weakest part of the experience is the wine list, and the lack of advise. it almost feels as if they are not really interested in wines. yes there is a selection with a choice of spanish wines, but i cannot discover a filosophy. the wines chosen from spanish region are mediocre. the one great bordeaux is the sélection madame du château cantenac 2007, also the only half bottle on the wine list. not a great year and ofcourse far to young to drink. serivce is too matter of factly, not bad but not outstanding. overal a nice place that just doesnt reach its potential."
"service was poor, it felt like we were not welcome, but that could also be due the fact that there were only 8 guests in total. the restaurant was a ghost town, and i understand why. the food was the worst, the meat was not even good enough to feed to a dog. you can get better food at the local snackbar. also be aware that no one talks dutch here, so english on "
"let me start off positively. beautiful place, great ambiance. have eaten here 3 times and the quality of the food varies. once everything came together very nicely. all good. but the last time it was a total trainwreck. waited for the food for over 90 minutes, the orders were wrong, service terrible, and the food was below par. the reason/excuse that was given? management (or ownership) had recently changed and things were a bit chaotic. i do not know if that has been cleared up and i wont be back to find out."
"place is nice, food ok but service is a disaster. we went for business lunch with 12 people and we were waiting around 1.5 hours then only 12 meals were delivered and one colleague had to wait another 10 minutes. not recommend for business lunches."
"mothers day lunch with 7 persons, restaurant had 3 other parties besides ours. expectations shot up by the chique welcome and the classic interiors. we were surprised by the special menu which wasnt advertised on their website, however, luckily also the normal menu was also availabl "
weve been here before and were looking forward to a quality dinner. parking is easy and the terrace is well equipped for outdoor dinin 
"villa has a nice convenient location. we came for a romantic dinner and the atmosphere was suitable for a pleasant evening. however, on the terrace there was no designated space for non-smokers and our meal experience was overshadowed by unpleasant and toxic fumes. towards the evening we couldnt see our plates anymore because it got dark and there was no light except one candle per table. the service was exceptionally slow as we got our starters exactly one hour after ordering. after pointing out the delay the staff did not apologize for this inconvenience. we had to ask separately for everything: bread, salt, pepper - as none of that was present at the tabl "
the building is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. the food looked much nicer than it tasted and we expected much more for this high price tag! my meat was tough and hard to chew and some of the other dishes were pretty tasteless. a real disappointment!
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay € 50 each. would not really recommend it."
we went to this place to try the magic sushi set they promote. the sushi was served with good portion of soy sauce and wasabi and we even got two pieces of sushi extra because of a november offer. the sushis tasted fresh and were not too bad (the quality can be compared to other all you can eat sushi joints). the only minus point was that there was mayonaise added to most of the sushi and that really made us feel fuller quickly.
"when you mix perfection with imperfection, the results are imperfect. thats unfortunately my experience with this little plac "
"we understand we dont speak dutch and some dutch dont speak english. the chinese lady that greeted us spoke no english and we ask for the buffet. she understood that and pointed us to one buffet rack with a second one near by but she make no indication toward it. she was able to understand our drink order. we when to the buffet rack indicated and served ourselves. we continued to serve ourselves from that rank until we were full. she made no attempt to advise us of other opportunities for our meal. as i left the buffet rack for the second time she spoke to me and of course i could not understand it. a dutch gentleman explained to me that we only used a very small portion of the dinner that was available to us. upset i returned to the table where my friends had finished and were waiting on me. a chinese man came to collect the very high bill and to our surprise. he spoke perfect english. we would advise that unless you speak dutch to avoid this restaurant. of the reviews i have ever given, this is the worst."
"the food selection is very wierd, difficult choices and no simple stuff like a torsie or broodje kroket. secondly there are no heathy things on the menu. the most healthy choice coms with gefrituurde kip. sometimes owners choose funny choices to stand out but sometimes simplicity rules!! also thh no e restaurant was cold. i wanted to work but went home instead "
nce location to sit and have drinks with friends. the restaurant is situated central of arnhem. is next to the bus stop and 5 minutes walking from the train station.
the staff sometimes cannot see the customers and let them wait so long. the cheese platter is not suitable for non-dutch people. cocktail is okay.
"the glass of my boyfriends favorite beer got smaller. the waiter explained that it didnt, but it did get significantly smaller and the price was the same，but we still spend over 100 euros to show our love，the most crazy thing was that when we walked out of the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted to go back and use the restroom, the waiter at the door said he was not allowed to enter the restaurant because he was not dressed nicely ( he was wearing his errea sweatpants and we just spent over 100 💶 there) we’re so sad and disappointed, bye bye stan "
"the food was top notch, the sevice was terrible, im guessing by other reviews this does not happen oftern, but it happened to me. i will not go to much into the weeds, as this place had great food, but i had little to no service, left for ages to eat, no follow up, food missing, my order was not as requested, waitied ages for bill, gave up and just went to pay my bill. told the young chap about my experinace, apoliges for the bad service, asked do you think he should speak to his manager, silance and nothing, gave up. if this was a training week for staff, i hit it bang on, shocking service, but im guessing a one off."
"not sure why it was crowded. ok the quality if the drinks are not bad, but pricy and services is bit arrogant"
"this place has everything to make it great. location, great food and drinks, nice ambiance. the whole letdown for me is the service. they always seem understaffed and the staff that is there seems to lack the capability of seeing what needs to happen. forgotten drinks, forgotten menus, forgotten empty glasses. such a shame. could be ten out of ten, but is marked down for the service."
very popular bar/restaurant. the main highlight is definitely the huge patio. the coffee was good. the food selection isn’t mouth watering.
"the service was great. the place was super busy. the pretzel app was good. i had the paella and it was...well it was awful. had the place not been so busy i would have sent it back. it was so dry it was actually crispy on the top (rice, mussels, and salad shrimp) and mushy inside. "
"had dinner with friends on a friday evening, seems to be a combination between a cafe/bar and a restaurant...it was very crowdy. friendly staff, good food (had a steak), restaurant itself also looks very nice (the way its designed, decorated)."
"central to all amenities, lovely ambience, love the buzz of the crowd, but alas i found the presentation of food, and the price lacking, even too expensive for what it was.  the service could also be more friendly, we dont owe them anything!"
"it has been the talk of the town, but the quality has certainly not gone up since the beginning. service was with a great smile this time, but the surf & turf burger was nothing special on a not totally fresh bun. its all ok, but you would expect mo "
"on a good location one can find this fashionable café / restaurant. there’s a lot of choice in hot and cold beverages, cakes and food. and a nice variation in seati "
i went to stan and co with a colleague for a working lunch. our table was very close to those next to us so we felt rather penned in. the place was bustling at lunchtim 
"a new place in arnhem in an old bank building. great location and design. nice atmosphere. it is very noisy, so i would not go there for an evening out dining with intimate tabletalk! food is ok, very suitable for a quick bite or drinks with friends if you are on your way to the cinema or theatre. the service at the table was very friendly, the lady receiving us and leading to the tables had her off day. "
"the food was very delicious and tasty. as an indian food lover, food was traditional and spicy, as can be expected. the service however was very poor, slow and not service oriented staff. a smile when dealing with customers can go a long way."
"we have recently moved from hilversum to arnhem. so we thought lets try indian food in arnhem. so we went to king of india and ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka and rice. it was a take aw "
"went for dinner as a group. nice reasonably easy service. helpful staff. however food was too spicy. ordered vegetarian dishes mostly and found them having an extra yard of spice. they have only naan bread and not the roti. the naans were not cooked well and were not crisp, found it tough to digest.not coming back again!"
we have often been to indian restaurants. these visits were always nice. this restaurant was an alltime low. this for the following reaso 
"we visited the restaurant on a sunday evening. when we arrived at 17.30 it was still quiet but when we left at 20.30 it was packed. the interior is trendy and warm. i liked it a lot. cosy atmosphere, interesting men "
"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"this restaurant serves real nice thai food. all the hits from thailand are on the menu. the value for money is also good. the atmosphere in the dining room however is poor. it is a thai theme, but in such a way that it is uninviting. the staff is young, so young that they are inexperienced and at some point that starts to be a nuisance. i will come back for the food and for nothing else."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress über-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.
there are a lot of great restaurants in nijmegen. this is not one of th 
"visited with a group of work colleagues. place was not busy but service was extremely slow from the start and never speeded up. food was reasonable, but felt slightly overpriced and the portion sizes a bit small."
"i feel extremely sad to provide a low rating to this restaurant. i am a big fan of restaurant ivory and was looking forward to eating at bistro bar ivory, since it opened. sadly, it is not the same standard as the origin "
"the service was very slow. from the beginning to end of our three course meal, we waited a long time. even when our carafe of water was long finished, we waited to be asked if we wanted more water or more wine. i finally stopped the waiter and asked for more water. the wait to order was 15 minutes. the wait for the first course was 45 minutes! then another 30 minutes(at least) for the main course. we were never asked if everything was ok; there simply was no check in with us. it was indeed a very busy night for them, but they should have been prepared for valentines evening as it was fully booked! the starter was good. we had the salmon and carpaccio. the main was luke warm and fair. we had the choc. creme brulee dessert which was far too sweet. the lobs of white choc on top was an addition of sugar that was not necessary and in my opinion no added value to the dessert. a raspberry or strawberry on top would have sufficed. we were recommended by locals to dine here. i am sorry to say, that i will choose differently next time i am in nijmegen."
"a cocktail bar that does not have tequila is shocking! the bar service was bad but the restaurant was top class and the rooms were clean. the business meetings went well but it support for audio and video was really bad. all together, i would give this hotel 5 out of 10."
"all you can eat concept restaurant. there is a lot to choose from however when busy order can come late or sometimes are delivered at the wrong table.  flavours are okay, nothing special, but nice to hang out with groups/kids."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"humphreys nijmegen recently moved to a new location. i always had good experiences at the old location. the new restaurant looks nice, but the service was a disaster! unpersonal, incompetent and slow. the restaurant is understaffed and the staff isnt well train "
had a three course dinner each for 27.95. we really were not impressed. good bread and dessert but the main dish of a mix grill and chicken was really bad. would not go back! over cooked and it didnt even match the description in the menu.
"straight forward reasonable priced meal, nothing bad and nothing extra ordinary.   lovely positioned by the river and staff very, very good, attentive, friendly and service minded."
"went here for a lunch/snack. paid a total of €12,55 for 2 medium sized portions of fries and 2 snacks. after almost 30 minutes our fast food arrived. it looked like small portions of fries but the lady ensured me this was normal. also the berehap snack which is known for being a big snack fitted in a small frikandel-sized cart "
had to go here due to the only other real good fish snack bar being closed. this will be the last visit here as well. i didnt like the very fluffy kibbeling ( not crunchy) at all.
"the restaurant is situated at the south of amsterdam, named as amstelveen district. as the district does not have too many prime options, this place comes to top destinations in terms of ambiance. indoor and outdoor sitting options together with the design increases your expectatio "
"be aware the service staff is totally not trained or have even any experience, you have to wait a long time for your food, one point of time te waiter go and redo te string of his shoes without washing his hands he take the cutleries and serve the table i told mij wijf look at this and guess what happen he served our table i went en clean the cutleries first, than at 21.30 hr a whole tray of beer went in to the kitchen and all kitchen staff started to drink beer and wines. as said its manage as family business without service. the restaurant is so noisy and on top of this every 20 minutes your loud throughout the restaurant the happy birthday songs voor children parties of adult dinners , you want to have a nice dinner without stress this is sure not the place as the tables are packed on each other for that even the food is quite good but the rest you have to forget."
"this restaurant is a prime location for gorden ramsey to save! if you want to spend alot of money for an unripe tomatoe and fake mozerrela passing as bufola , wait two hours for soggy pasta in a puddel of canned tamatoe sause bought at the local supermarkt, be my guest as you will not be theirs as they do not care about you ,at all! the service was arrogant, extremely slow,and unresponsive. do youself a favor and look somewhere else. the are some great restaurants in the area, this is certianly not one."
"i went for take away pizza here in corona time. they were open for business which deserves a compliment. i wish i could say the same about the pizza. it was well below par - tasteless pie and cheap ingredients. i don’t know it this is related to the corona times, but i fear not. not recommended - there is plenty much better pizza around"
"we ordered pizza at home, it was disgusting. the ingredients are cheap as hell how dare you calling mozzarella a cheap cheese? never again, there are so many good places to eat, stay away from this one.."
"first time nearby town decided to try out this restaurant.  food: average, too much salt on my rib eye. overall texture was good.  the tiramisu is nice, balance taste and soft.  ambience: overall very comfortable environment, good for family gathering place. nice backyard."
"ambience of the restaurant was nice, service staff friendly.. unfortunately the food was. it up to m "
"nice ambiance. terribly slow service. staff does not look around to see if anyone needs service. we had to chase up staff for every step of the way: our first drink, for a menu-card, for ordering the food, for a dessert-menu card, for the dessert. my own main course was fine; my partners was much too salty. after again having had to wait for 10 minutes for someone to order our dessert we decided to leave without the dessert as no one was paying any attention to our attempts to snare a staff member. our total visit lasted 90 minutes in which we managed to drink 2 glasses of wine and have a main course; most of the time was spent on waiting and trying to attract attention from the staff. as no staff paid any attention we left our table to get the bill and pay at the till, where the staff member had the temerity to state we had only had to wait 5 minutes before being serv "

"with a colleague of mine we decided to have a dinner here during a business trip, after learning that the food was excellent. when we entered the restaurant we were not impressed by the atmosphere inside, which seemed a bit old and not entirely proper. the garden, however, was amazing and we sat outside with pleasure. it was a spacious garden with green view and wonderful sunshi "
"indonesian food is definitely something to have in amsterdam, probably the best food you can get. we had high expectations about ron but we found it was average compared to other indonesian plac "
"we waited 30 min to be approached by the waiter who threw down a cocktail list and ‘street food’ menu. when the waiter appeared 20 min later i asked for the food menu. i was told to order starters from the menu given. i explained i’d like to see the actual menu so as to gage how and what to order. i had to ask twice after this for actual menu. we were finally served out drink order an hour after we arrived. it then took another hour for our main courses to arrive-could not get a waiter or any staff over to refresh drinks, serve water or even acknowledge we were sitting there. our food finally arrived after 1 hour and 50 min from time of reservation. food was cold and unappetizing. one of our main courses was forgotten and when we finally got the attention of the waiter they brought it out, we had finished eating by that time- it was warm though. bad food, horrible horrible service. they offered free tea and coffee to make up for a very disappointing experience, and pretty disgusting food."
"we booked to go to the restaurant with family who were visiting from abroad. the restaurant were very nice in accommodating our request to sit at the back but unfortunately our experience after that was less positive. the waitress who served us was extremely rude and very inattentive and unprofessional. our guests as well as myself have specific dietary requirements. we asked what their famous buffet entailed to which (including a strict no seafood or shellfish dietary requirement) a response of chicken, beef and it and rice was given. the waitress was extremely short and rude (guests were english and even they noticed this and commented). she was smiling whilst serving other tables so we couldn’t quite understand this. to say that she ruined our evening was an understatement. at a certain point we even saw her looking at our table making faces whilst talking to a colleague. when our food arrived, there were prawn crackers on both my dish that i ordered as well as the buffet. in addition to this, most apart from 3 dishes of the 8 were meat dishes and the rest veggie. one of the dishes being the crackers that they serve when you come in with some peanut sauce. we left having spent close to €200 and not having an enjoyable evening at all. this is not the first time we’ve been to this restaurant but the first time we’ve had such a negative experience. before leaving we let the manager know what had happened and his response was ‘unfortunately i cannot do anything to remedy the situation now’. all i can say is we won’t be going back especially if our feedback wasn’t taken seriously in any way! huge disappointment!"
we split two rice tables between three which was sufficient. the food was excellent unlike the service.  our main waitress was uncooperative and rude. she must have been aware because she got better as the evening wore on.
"employee who greeted us was rather abrupt and rather cocky. other employees were pleasant. asked to sit outside next to river and employee remarked, “it’s raining” i asked if we could sit in yard off back of restaurant and she again replied, “it’s raining”. it wasn’t raining just cloudy but pleasant. i felt they just didn’t want to serve us on their beautiful deck. kitchen was open to restaurant and fascinating to watch. decor was authentic and lovely. food was delicious."
"hardly any vega dishes and the ones oredered were extremely dissapointing. overcooked, flacid, tasteless gado gado... too acidic and no substance fake tartare. rissoles were ok but all flavors repeated in gado gado. pricey too."
"we came with high expectations, as ron blaauw is a renowned chef. well, and actually thats the problem with tv chefs opening up restaurants in multiple numbers, they seem to lose control and lose the eye for details. actually, that seems to be exactly the case at ron gastrobar indones "
"had high expectation for this restaurant, since it bears the name of ron blaauw. he has a rather outspoken opinion on the way a restaurant should be judged: performance of the kitchen brigade over restaurant ambiance and sta "
"food, service and ambiance were okay: the chef even came to give us a quick visit. however: very cramped table that was absolutely unfit to accommodate a ‘rijsttafel’ for four. the high chairs were very uncomfortable. the restaurant snelle heavily of cooking smells (perhaps an issue with the kitchen ventilation) so your cloths smell of food which is very annoying when you have something else afterwards. then, we got a quite significant discount as we left before 19 hrs (we didn’t know this upfront) yet i fail to see how this fits into the concept of what ron’s gastrobar pretends to  "
"at the end of the dinner i had the same feeling as when i visit a mac donald: i don’t want to hear about it for the next 3 months...the rijstafel is a combination of very strong flavours and spices covering the taste of the meat or fish. too much cocoa, too much peanut butter. good just for once in a long while"
"the disappointment started with the reservation. i had a groupon, but all groupon seats were sold out for the weekend. when i asked when i could redeem the voucher the answer was: thats not my problem. when we finally got the reservation on a thursday night we were met at the door by some very friendly staff. the groupon allowed for 1 starter per person from the menu + the rijst tafel + a desert. the starters were tasty except for the taco. these had so much mayonnaise that you basically tasted nothing else. not even sure why there is mayonnaise in indonesian food. the rijst tafel was very tasty, with rather small portions. really needed the rice as a filler. the place was relatively busy, so i took very long to get our food. the wine list is good, yet pricy. overall the food and wines are nice, but overcharged. i have also had much better indonesian food at much more affordable prices. if you like to eat at the high end of the market in a trendy environment you will probably like the place. i am not sure if i will be back as i dont think you get sufficient value for money."
"i am actually rather apprehensive of typing a negative review for this gastrobar, as i have heard and seen fantastic reviews for it. perhaps, the experience differed so drastically as i had ordered it via a food delivery app. instead of enjoying the food as most of the other guests have evidently had, we found that the food served was absolutely appalling and worse than most hawker centre fare that we have had back in our hometown of singapo "
"the location is fantastic, but i didnt find the food to add anything to the standard indonesian rice tables you find everywhere else in amsterdam.   it was really good, but it lacks that special something that all the other ron gastrobars bring."
"i have been several times in different restaurant from ron blauw and i never experienced such a rude waitress. we arrived to the restaurant with a groupon, i had a problem with the printer and i called the restaurant to know if i could forward the groupon to them, they said no probl "
price & what is deliverd do not match. friendly people and clean restaurant. we discovered at home the quality and that was not for a 2nd time.
i went there after reading others reviews. food was not at all tasty. the dumplings menu said chicken and prawns but i didn’t taste any prawns at all. the pieces were too small for the price. the soups were not warm at all and they were too creamy with coconut milk and slagroom i guess. the main dish of vegetables red curry was too sweet. 
"we tried diwali’s butter chicken, i have never had such a sweet sauce ever , they are not cheap and i expect the best, there was 25% tofu in our butter chicken meal, as it was, there was mot much chicken in the dish, never again, will be going back to indian kitchen for our next orders."
"i am from england and am used to excellent indian cuisine. basically what we got ( indian menu) was more like take out food..pretty bland. lacked a lot of spicing and was sloshed in rather undefinable sauces. waiters very friendly, location good, very clean."
"sadly, having visited this restaurant numerous times before, we were disappointed this time.  covid has made staffing complicated and we understand that. what is difficult to accept is cooking that is less accomplished than expected at this price level."
maybe it is a nice restaurant with delicious dishes but unfortunately we couldnt try. despite we have reserved a table for lunch once we came noone met us. moreover we were told that it is too late for lunch and they dont know about the reservation. afterwards they realised the mistake but didnt even apologize 
"we there as part of quite a large group. the venue isnt really set up for 50 to stand around for a pre-dinner drink, and then the service at table, whilst smiley, was a little in/out.  food at scale, a set menu, was nice."
"typical high-end dutch cuisine that ends up in flat & super expensive dishes. the food is just not tasty. the service is great and the environment is amazing, but the price is too high for the food you get there."
the location of this restaurant is no less than superb inside a 19th century windmill. de jonge dikkert has been awarded a bib gourmand as well as having 12 points from gault mill

"the place is unique and beautiful, inside an original old windmill. the meals i experienced were not so special. i mean,surely it was a novelle cuisine menu,with small portions and style and particular and researched ingredients. the results was surely under the expectations (we had a complete menu).moreover, i would never put together a fish-based first meal (raviolo with lobster) and a beef for second. but its just my opini "
"who is kidding who, here? posh, poncey and pricey. instead, splash-out in amsterdam (jordaan or de pijp)."
"i went there with my friends happy to show me this lovely place and for tasting the food... i was wonder about the location.. a typical traditional windmill wow... food was nice and wine and beer too, bread the best ever in the nederland i think and cakes very good... but what i didnt find lovely good and tasteful was the welcome and service of the owner and waiter and waitress "
the tempura is always reliable. tried something different and i am still deciding on eating it.  the beer is kirin and sappro always good.
"the food was ok, but the service was slow and somewhat unattentive. moreover, it was very cold in the restaurant, which made the overall experience a lot less than expected."
oversll the food is pretty good here however.... we had two beef tepanyaki’s one was excelent one was overcooked. we also had the crispy shrimp roll menu shows 8 pieces with caviar on the outside served were 6 pieces of cold bland rolls with caviar on the inside (supposedly). all individual sushi is pictured as 2 pieces with a price but prices are per piece (mentioned as a note on the menu). after complaining to the waitress nothing was done no attempt to correct this or compensate us. eventhough mostly good (but pricey) food the service and deceptive menu won’t make me go back.
"i ordered ramen. it smells like toilet. topping pork slice especially smells spoilt lard. as soon as i felt this is not a food that i should eat, i returned it to the restaurant. finally they charged me all including this non eatable food. i know japanese food and service very well, their food and serve are far below the ones i know. never come back again."
"competition has definitely caught up and this place is just too far from amsterdam for me to visit (was worth the trip before, now not so much).  people serving are helpful however, nothing to fault on that side."
"being used to the cosy japanese atmosphere in amstelveen i tried this new venue. not only was the service not up to the way i was used to it, but i missed the japanese atmosphere that was so nice in the old place. food was average, service was o.k, but not like i was used  "
good food bad service! food portion also very small. not very expensive but it is affordable. have a nice environment and right next to a shopping center.
"i ate here several times and the food was fine; really simple rolls, nothing surprising, but fairly good. until today when i made a reservation, arrived on time and they told me to wait at the bar... where there was no room for four people. so we had to wait outside, in the cold for 20 minutes, because the restaurant is so small there is no room for waiting inside. the worse part was that the hostess was not even apologetic, but plainly rude. i was so surprised in the beginning, when she told us that our table was not ready and refused to give me an estimated time, that i waited until she told me we could finally sit down. we never received an apology, not even a nice face... she was sassy and bad tempered all the time, as if it had been our fault! i decided i had had enough and went to loetjes in ouderkerk, where people are friendly and steak is great."
"we go to this place a lot for lunch with friends or for business. the place looks like a real japanese traditional place which is nice, but radio background was always blasting loudly. , too bad since the atmosphere of the restaurant doesnt fit with the noise. the service is okay, can be much better if they smile more instead of acting a bit annoyed that we are coming to eat there. never stop us in coming back though. the good food with good value top everything else :)"
"the sashimi was very good,everything else was too much overcooked or rotten: my girlfriend puked a bucket full at home."
"amstelveen has a large japanese community but no japanese dine here, even though it is centrally located. food, just about bearable considering people origined from a nation nearby preparing, however, please do not mistake in any way that this is how the japanese serve their guests. you must bare in mind this is a japanese themed restaurant run by people from other asian country and if you know the real thing you just would not touch it. everything over priced using cheapest possible material, fooling customers who would not know any better. unfortunately, this trend seems quite common everywhere. real shame. "
"first review ever here, and only because the experience was so bad that i couldnt not say anything. ive long believed that food should be the most important part of dining out, and that most reviewers are oversensitive (or entitled) when it comes to service, but in this case the service was so disappointing that it cast a pall over anything else tanuki actually did rig "
"came in at the tail end of lunch service (3:30) was told that the place closes at 4. though no problem as we just wanted a quick bite. after taking 15min to bring us our order, however, we were given less than 10 minutes to finish our meal when at 3:52 the waiter comes and puts his finger in my bowl and takes it from me in mid bite! hey im not done  i say. i told you 2 time you leave at four! he says. its still 350 i say. he does not respond and proceeds to walk away with my unfinished tuna bowl. i thought i was on some sort or hidden camera sho "
"i went to tanuki last monday, 9th december, with a friend for lunch. this was my second time there. first time was good food, it was busy but we got our food with a reasonable delay. this time we arrived, waited to be seated for a few minutes at the door as the waiter made a few eye contacts with us, but failed to tell us that he will be with us shortly. then we decided maybe it is better to sit somewhere without reserved sign, then the waiter ran to us asking us to sit at a table finally, we told him we would rather sit at a big table sharing with others. we took the menus, made our choice and started waiting for the waiter, when we made clear we already know what we want, he refused to come as there was another table still going through their menus, yes they were before us, but our waiter preferred to wait for them, his gestures and body language started becoming a bit annoying at that moment. in principle we were ok as the other table was there before us. then a japanese gentleman showed up, sat at the big table sharing it with us. then our waiter greeted him, and immediately took his order without any issues. we immediately decided to leave the place, although food is very good, this waiter was extremely rud "
"this restaurant is highly regarded as the japanese restaurant in amstelveen, which has a large japanese community. i am sure that the food can be good at tanuki given its reputation, but in our case, it was inconsistent at be "
this is a smart well decorated restaurant but the quantity of gnocchi with bolognaise sauce was insufficient for a starter and i ordered it as a main. suggest you choose the chinese next door and get some decent food.
our hotel recommended this one and it was full of tourists from other hotels that recommended it. the wait staff were disagreeable with each other and it carried over into their service. the food came out on time but we were stressed after our dinner from the cold atmosphere in the room. we ordered the main course ravioli to share as an appetizer and it was good—one large piece of ravioli. we ordered the grilled fish sampler for main course. the sole was good as was the tuna and shrimp but the salmon was over cooked. we ate at some terrific restaurants and cafes during our three days here and this was one i would skip.
"too bad! asian quality restaurants in the the netherlands continue on a low level. amber garden was highly recommended to us , so we had high expectations when we booked a table. the place looks promising when you enter, clean, large, many people and the menu looks promising too. we had some dim sum as a starter, was ok,but they forgot to serve the sauces .we had the duck spring rolls, very nice! we ordered duck and fried rice and seabass. the duck arrived cold and dry, was overcooked, no sauces. the rice never arrived, the sea bass was nice and fresh, but not prepared the asian way, no spices no sauce. still no rice!!! finally when we finished the main courses the fried rice arrived, again not hot at all and no taste. too bad!"
quite a beautiful and modern restaurant with friendly staff. everything looks modern and kitchen very clean. food is very good and many authentic and special dishes are on the menu (which menu in the form of a stunning booklet 
because of the covid closure we decided to order the dinerbox from aan de po 
a two michelin-star rated restaurant has to be really impressive. this restaurant only impressed in price. the portion sizes were ridiculously small. the chef even came out and told us at the start the portions would be small! i guess we could have left then. the food quality was good but at these prices and quantities i would take the nearby jonge dikkert any day!
to be honest - we expected much more. the chefs menue looked fantastic and we started off with a beautiful raw kingfish dish. after that flavours became a bit flat with as major disappointment the eel with foie and appel which was just too much together - made u think of pancake with bacon and apple. staff was nice and chefs personal attention was well received.
"made reservations with american express centurian months earlier. we were seated at the darkest table next to the door with no view. waitress approached the table and asked if e wanted and an aperitief, a glass of wine or a cocktail. i asked for a specific vodka on the rocks and my husband a martini. waitress responds with we can make hers but we cant make a martini(why offer a cocktail) (what?). then, all of a sudden someone found our reservation and moved us to a better table (we didnt say a word about the first one). serving staff plopped down the amuse bouche, but couldnt be bothered to explain indetail. if youre putting it on the plate, tell me why it should be there, or if too confusing, leave it off. the young woman who was the sommelier was very informative and helpful on the other hand. food. dissapointing at best. eaten at le bernadin and latelier de joel rubuchon, where the late chef roubuchon came and talked to us about his food, amoung many starred restaurants and this was disappointing. poor discriptions and very little harmony in the ingrediants. take the smoked eel. long strip of eel drapped across a bowl (why so much). and a little glob of foie gras in the middle. foie is so delicate the eel totally over whelmed it. no respect for the ingrediants. my husband felt the poor service was because we werent local, but why should that matter in a 2 starred restaurant. staff needs better training in service, like what the meaning of the word is, and kitchen needs to tighten up, less ingrediants to confuse, just let the product sing on its own! would not recommend. "
"for this is a fine dining restaurant, i expected a warm welcome, attentive service, and excellent food. in the whole dining, i couldnt not find a waiter or waitress to give me a smile. the tone was robotic and efficient as if we were in a fast food chain store: “please eat and g "
had to wait for ages and didnt think the food was great.... and for those prices!!! staff i thought were also rude which made it all in all not a good choice for a family birthday meal.
"food is of course good and beautifully displayed in this 2-star michelin restaurant. nice terrace, too bad there were no white table cloths on the black tables. we also found the staff to be a bit underdressed (jeans and sneakers). staff did whatever they needed to do correctly but nothing more. too bad the high-and-mightiness that seems to be typical for many upscale restaurants in and around amsterdam, also found its way to aan de poel."
"the restaurant was pretty busy for wednesday evening, but seems more the business and show off people. food was ok, has a feeling as invention stopped some time ago and a menu formula was a novelty. some dishes were very well presented, one was really delicious (blackened entrecôte). so at the end i would recommend to have there st jacques and entrecôte. and menu especially the 6 dish is exaggerated - especially in price (think it goes to 90 euros). we did not like the interior and the artificial flowers (in the netherlands?!!) are too cheap for that type of restaurant. there are better places - even very close het bosch , which i have visited many times is beating it easily "
"good food with reasonable price. however, the service and tempo are not worth the two star at all. we wait for almost one hour for dessert and the four courses set took us 160 mins...it also took more than 10 mins to get check. its a truly awful experience and i wont visit again for sure."
we went to the restaurant 4 people. drank a lot of wine and paid the bill without studying it closely. later on we discovered that we were charged for 5 people instead of 4 for the 5-course dinner that we ha 
"we reserved an outside table at this restaurant on one of the hottest days of the summer. in the afternoon before our visit the staff called to confirm our reservation. we confirmed and because of the nice weather we specifically asked again for an outside table, which was said to be no proble "
"i can be real short on this one: rude and unfriendly service, acceptable food, nice location. please stay away."
"we had very high expectations but nothing was special about the restaurant, service was below average far from 2 michelin star standards, service people was having an otiose arrogance, food was nothing special, dressings of food was good but taste was not that special, ambiance is also nothing special"
"rude staff, i do not recommend this restaurant.  there are many other great options close by.  stopped by on a tuesday evening and have never had a worse experience."
"went with pretty high hopes and recommendations. went well on arrival, champagne and oysters on beautiful terrace, but then nothing. sat for 30 mins with empty glasses. chased down a waiter who sent someone to our table and we asked for a glass of wine that would go with the first course. nothing for another 20 mins and i had to chase down a waiter again. i actually asked if there was something wrong because there seemed to be a swarm of confused looking staff but no service. no apology, no understanding of our situation, in fact, their answer was about having 80 covers and it being difficult when everyone moves from outside terrace to inside. hmm, made to feel i shouldnt have complained. wont be going back here. made me feel i was in a chain restauran "
"if it were just for the taste of the food i would definitely recommend aan de poel. we had the 6 course alliance menu recommended by the chef and all dishes were very tasty, with simple ingedients and not too molecular. only down side with the menu was that the portions remained very small, and even for a tiny person like me, i was quite hungry after all amuses, starters and mains, so i had to order some extra cheese. i have never experienced this in a michelin star restaura "
we were checking out this place to celebrate our honeymoon party in december. so we were sitting on the bar and ordered a beer. then they told us we could not get a drink on the bar if we were not also eating. so we told our story that we were checking out the place and we also would like to see the menu. then they told us friendly to leave....
"the food was beautiful. all the flavours went together marvelously. we had the 6 course seasonal menue. however, after having spend a lovely evening, we were shocked when the valet told us that our car was broken into! in the restaurants parking lot and under their supervision. the thief stole my working laptop in the trunk. very unfortunate event, the security should have been tighter, especially since they told us it was the second time within a year that this had happened."
"after a great time here in 2010 we went back. this time the food and service were of much lower quality. the price / quality ratio is not ok. no really outstanding dishes as before. service is often slow and not really professional. at the end the bill had several errors. correcting the bill took very long, while we had indicated to be in a hurry. the waiter even let the new bill wait at his desk and went to bring drinks to other guests, before handing us the bill. all the time we were waiting at the exit. very rude. we had a bad experience."
"we had only 2 hours to finish our dinner (which were not told in advance) but we waited 40 minutes before the first dishes were served, we had no choice but to leave several dishes unfinished because the serving was so slow, would not recommend this place despite the decent food and their inflated popularity. "
this was the most untasty and bad looking sushi i ever eat in my life. tampura was greasy and pale taste. old oil is used in all fried things tasted very ugly. edamame overcooked. sushi had very little fish. service was rude. the owner was not listening to our feedback and blamed us. one of our friends had to puke the food.
never again for me and my famil

i have visited this restaurant and found broken glass in my drink. the waiter didnt even apologize for this horrofying event. many of my friends agree with me that the service of kokusai is terrible and it is a place where hygiene and safety is apparently not paramount in this plac 
"the rice was way too hot. the salmon and tuna were also tasteless, which resulted in many rolls being really bland, due to lack of ingredients. the edamame beans were missing salt and lemon. if you eat here stay away from the sushi, and stick to the grilled meat. the service was fast though "
food here is good even though they mix up orders sometimes. want soy its zn excellent restaurant its ok.
we went with a group of eight. restaurant is big but there’s a nice atmosphere. we had the all you can eat and that was a mistake. you can pick 4 choices per round but we couldn’t order it together so the table was kinda cut in half. i can honestly say we never got all our dishes and the other side of the table didn’t get anything until we were on round tw

"centraly located in amstelveen, average sushi in a nice ambiance. menu not that extended and some dishes have to be paid additionaly."
"although you will not eat the beat sushi nl has to offer at kokusai, the food is absolutely of an acceptable standard and can be considered fair to good. our kids love this place. lots of choice."
"nice decor and welcoming staff. the food is okay ut not better than any other all you can eat sushi restaurant within amsterdam area, the price is 20€ more expensive for the same prestation and you have 1 item less per round."
went to this restaurant two times - both with colleagues for dinn 
service is very bad from those two manager are whatever they are.  food get worse every time i get back there with friends.
large all you can eat place with sushi and other asian dishes. only reason to there is to feed hungry teenagers
"good selection of sushi if you like that sort of thing. i prefer cooked food, and they have some nice options here. i love the gyoza in particular. i eat here often with colleagues or friends and it ticks the boxes every ti "
"this is a standard eat all you can formula restaurant. the quality of the food is good, the ambiance may feel a bit hasty. do not expect haute cuisine good for a group of friends or a family outing"
good food but very bad service. reservation is not honoured in busy season. there is no guaranteed seating even with advance reservation on weekends. any food not partly eaten that remain on the plate is charged. one year old baby who ate no food but simply slept in the stroller was charged 6.50 euros. the restaurant is staffed with rude chinese staff who serve the tables inadequately and always tried to impose extra bottles of drink. upstairs is worse than downstairs for attentive customer service. visited this restaurant 5 times in the summer of 2015. found a better place in amstelveen for sushi right next door. it is called tanuki japans eetcafé 
"looked nice from the outside, but turned out to be a massive all-you-can-eat place. luckily we managed to work around this for lunch. service was fi "
this is a nice restaurant with a warm atmosphere but unfortunately the sushi was tasteless and the tempura had a oily taste. the tuna sashimi was worthless. the service was very good though. but i am definitely not coming back again. not worth my money
i am with a friend right now to the restaurant. the service is slower than death. plates in all you can eat are coming 1 every 5-7 minutes. the waitor has pause his work to talk with some friends for more than 15 minutes and we have already wait to order for the second round. its a mess. the quality is good but not as other restaurants
cheap all you can eat japanese hangout. fully booked nearly every evening so make to to make reservations (should you crave for sushi and have a low budget...)
"well, expecting a great lunch we entered a huge room with only one other guest -- but still had to wait a lot. moreover we had to fill in the choosen articles ourselves, adhering to the procedure (very cumbersome if you need a quick lunch during work and there are no other guests...). food was served in microportions at (high) fixed prices. no ice in the coke, and the spicy thai beef was bad meat without any taste (soup quality but t-bone price) covered with a huge pile of watery paprika = tasteless peppers. fried chicken was like the quality of mc donalds. actually i had a chicken burger after this meal, we left after 20 minutes, complained politely but got no reaction at all and had to pay the full price. shame on you, but we now understand why the place is so empty..."
"we made a reservation, but our table was not ready at the time we arrived. then we had to wait at the bar, where no seats were available. the acoustic in the restaurant is quite bad, it is very noisy. the food was good, although we did not receive all the dishes we ordered due to the sloppy way the dishes are served."

"super great food, and big portions. but the staff was not very professional, we sat inside under the stairs and ashes of a cigarette fell from upstairs on our table. we told the staff and they did nothing to compensate, very bad. not planning to go back! "
very bad service. long wait for being served. we left after the main course after being 2 hours in the restaurant. very bad experience.
had dinner here for first time. we went on a frid 
"we have been there 5 times. every time we like the food and ambience but yesterday really pissed me off when i saw there was no outdoor seating. during covid, they are making you seat close by with other guests which really pissed me off. the lady at the reception was adamant that she couldnt seat me elsewhere which is nonsense because they have huge seating area inside and many places were vacant. atleast they should mention this in their website. i repeatedly requested her to make me seat not somewhere closer with other people but she was very rude and didnt seem to bother so much. rest all is fabulous for us. great for kids, big gatherings. really good parking space.we enjoy the food as well. but forced to give a 3star rating for the lady´s ungrateful behaviour yesterday."
this asian restaurant is located in amstelveen which is close to the airport. there is ample free parki 
as always huge japanese restaurant with so many courses for so much money...most folk dont get through the whole number of courses. food is reasonable average japanese. service is friendly. excellent free parking. good for families..but if you are not with kids go later on in the evening..its quite noisy with kids running all over the place early on in service time. wine pricey for the quality.
"wisiting the restaurant on a wednesday evening, 12 people in total. the consept of ordering several small dishes time after time is actually a good way of serving asian food. but with that mann people on one table, it was caotic. a lot of the dishes look the same, and without any nametag on, the caos starts at once. but in the end, we all had our stomach filled up. the taste of the food was a bit disapointing. i exepect more taste and flavour from this kind of food, and often you can choose how strong you want the taste. but in the end we had a buffet with cakes and icecream. that was yummi."
this is not the first time we eat in this restaurant but this is the first time they asked us to leave 30 minutes before out time limit don 
the place is amazing and mode 
"large but set up in areas so it still feels cozy. friendly personal. food not bad at all, several of my japanese friends say so. wine is simple, sake only warm."
"the all-you-can-eat menu is fine as, if you are very hungry, you may indeed eat a lot and for reasonable price. plus : free parking. the quality is ok but is not exceptional."
"im never very excited about all you can eat formula. in this case my worst fears were confirmed. the food is basically not alive, it seemed it had been prepared a long time before being serv "
"comparing to the similar other restaurant as sushi eat as much as you can the quality is rather high, although its not real japanese but chinese copy. only bad remark is we can order only 4 items in once, so we have to wait very long till we get next order. so, in the first half we became very hungry. but by the end we could became full stomach. so, it is ok. we want to visit there again."
"some points to consider, before you visit the pla "
"fixed menu with 5 courses , 4 dishes each of sushi and sashimi. some of the japanese waiters were unable to explain the dishes to help the menu selection. sushi dishes were average"
"fussia is an aziatic eatfactory. a topic when you dine with a group. but no ambiance if you celebrate a special occasion for a couple. regularly there is someone who is celebrating his or here anniversary and than they serve a fireworkfountain. nice, but then half of the people starts to sing. thats nothing for us. the all you can eat formula is apparently a nice thing for a broad public. but by our opinoion there are better restaurants in this range in aalsmeer en amstelveen. nevertheless, we had a good meal and the service was good. very fast and exactly according to our demand. nice! especially when you take in considerance that all seats were occupied."

"while the pork main dish was excellent, the beef stew was chewy and lacking in vegetables. it was just an unappetizing plate of meat and rice. the childrens meals were unimaginative and average, and oddly featured syrup pancakes as a main childrens course. the brightly venue did not feel cozy and intimate."
"we have visited bistro nice! in previous years, and although relatively expensive, the food has been good. this year it was a total disaster. i had pork which was tough and tasteless, my travelling partner had beef which was seriously undercooked and was still oozing blood and inedible. chips were served with both our dishes and these were quite hard and bit "
we have come here more often as it is convenient and better than a lot of the brown restaurant choices in amstelvee 
"food was wonderful but portions were very small. waitress was very nice but we only saw her when she took our order and brought our food. between those times, she was nowhere to be found. she never came back to ask if we needed anything else. i wanted another drink but never found her to order it. we eventually had to ask another waitress when we wanted ketchup. she also forgot about it for a while. food was fine though. just not very filling."
not all to special in taste and choi 
"as others have noted, the menu is limited. in contrast to what others have said, the service was adequate, not terribly bad. but my problem here is that the walls are all brick, the floor is wood and the ceiling is a hard tile. as a consequence, there is a huge amount of noise. it was nearly impossible to hear the waiter let alone anyone at your table. everyone reacted to the bad acoustics by talking louder than normal, which creates a vicious circ "

"been going here for over 11 years but last visit in april was not great but decided to give it another chance. big mistake, food was awful and could not even eat it. they used to have an extensive menu and loads of specials so always something tasty and also wonderful to eat. now they have narrowed the menu to a very limited choice and they cannot even cook it right. never again.. sorry!"
"very bad service. no attention from personnel and arrogant.  actually the restaurant is not crowded,  not recommended to visit."
on 14th we expressly drove by to book a table at the waterside for 16th june. the waiter said he could not guarantee the table at the waterfront.
"dont waste your time to go there.  rude staff, bad service, you wont get attention as a customer and it will take years to get your meal"
outdoor space was beautiful right on the river but not used for dinner service?!?! we had to sit inside a rather warm dining room with a view of the river across the street. waiter was pleasant and polite. food was good but fairly expensive.
"the service of this place is the worse i had in years, they came 5 time to bring us a capuccino and a cake that we didn’t order, took so long to get anything you order. looks like every waiter is at their first day work. great location, food mediocre. go there only for drinks if you have no hurry"
food mediocre. service horrible. they just throw the wine on the table and expect you to open the bottles and pour the wine. left over french fries sat on the table for a few of us during dessert. do they think we will eat cold french fries with the dessert??? aweful. will never go back 
i visited for lunch on wednesday 19 september. the group of 4 ordered varous sandwiches and i asked for a vegetarian sandwich without goat’s cheese. the waitress said that they did not have sny other options and i was served bread rolls with a (small) side of truffel mayonaise. i got the impression that she (or the chef) couldn’t care less. i would have got a better sandwich in a simple cafe. disappointed!
"we arrived & stood waiting on the terrace to be seated while 2 waitresses stood at the bar ignoring us. i then asked them for a table & they pointed to a dirty table that we sat at. after 5 minutes the waitress cleared it but i had to get our own menus. waited 10 minutes & asked twice for drinks which eventually came. food was not as slow as staff and was nice although had to get our own cutlery. at one stage while customers waiting, one waitress stood on street chatting to friends. lovely location but cafe loetje much much better. "
"the food was oke for the price, but the service staff unprofessional and not on top of it. the 3 menu courses where fine. the lobster sauce that comes with the fish was very little on the plate. asking for more... twice... nothing happend, waiting to long for everything that was ordered."
"this restaurant is very good for dinner. the menu has few vegetarian options or only 1 i can say. however, it good. service was also good, but what i liked the most is location, love to have dinner on a waterside restaurant. parking is also available."
"we have eaten at paardenburg several times as it is a great spot for lunch on a terrace by the water. service was never great and prices are a little on the high side but this time service was just so bad that we will probably not be back. at our arrival, the restaurant was only 1/4 full but we had to wait 10mn for someone to attend to us. then the waiters had to discuss between them for another 5mn to understand if the table we wanted was reserved or not (it was not). when we were seated, no one offered a menu card nor took orders for drinks. after 15mn of waiting and grabbing the attention of waiters we finally got a menu card and managed to order. 5mn later another waiter asked if he could take our order ?!. another 30mn later our dishes had still not arrived and we had to enquire. we were told that the it system was down and that our order had probably not been passed to the kitchen and we were asked to remind them what we had ordered. finally one hour after our arrival we got served. as we paid the bill, the waiter did apologize with a smile but thats it. for a restaurant charging around 30 euros for a main dish at dinner this is simply not an acceptable level of service."
"since april new owner, who wasn’t around. we have been here a dozen times before but this new owner is ruining the place really fa "
forty-five minutes to get food after ordering. no waitstaff visit for second drink. avoid this restaurant!
"the location is absolutely stunning. we went for a bike ride to this restaurant with locals who dine there regularly. we were greeted by a young man who was very sweet but had zero clue about anything on the menu. anything you asked him, his answer was i dont know. another young lady came and took our order. 3 guests ordered just an entree and one guest ordered their 3 course lunch option. one would think that the 1st appetizer course would of come out first for the one guest. no, the 3 entrees came out and the other guest got her appetizer. but i should mention that actually one guest did not get his entree at this time we waited about 20 minutes for his bouillabaisse to come out while our food just sat. at this point we inquired about the entree for the person with the three course and were looked at as if she was shocked that we would of wanted all of our entrees at the same time. she then came back to our table to educate us in a very serious manner on how we cannot expect our entrees to come out all together if one person orders a three course meal. i did not say anything but lesson 101 in the restaurant business, its called coursing. the appetizer should of come out first for the one guest, and then all 4 guests entrees should of come out together. we are now about 1 hour and 30 minutes into our meal when we finally got the last entree. we asked her when she served the last entree (this person is now eating alone as everyone else finished their entree) if she would please bring out the dessert immediately, this never happened. we finally had to ask a 3rd and 4th person if we could receive our dessert. needless to say this lunch of 2 salads, bouillabaisse and a 3 course meal took over 2 hours. luckily we were on vacation and going to have a wonderful time no matter what, but i have never seen such slow service in my life. now as far as the kitchen goes, wow the food was to die for. i will say that a gentleman did approach our table at the end and apologize for how slow it took, which was nice to see that someone acknowledged this was crazy long. i am not sure i would go again but delicious."
"we’ve been here twice sice the change of owner and the service has really changed, but not for the bett "
"we were invited by our business colleagues. nice location, there is some outside seating next to the river. food was average. sea bass was overcooked, nothing special. one would expect better quality for quite high price. service was extremely slow for almost empty restaurant. it took us hour and a half to eat lunch. my recommendation is to look for another place. "
we came here for a groupon deal to taste several dishes. we enjoyed the food and ambience. it is a little bit upmarket and i would have expected better service (has to be more attentive)
sat here to have some drinks right on the river side. worthwhile to come this way on a sunny day. dont expect great service while they where more busy with them selves but for just a drink its good enough.
the setting on the amstel and the terrace are lovely. so stop for an aperitif and go somewhere else for food. 15 euros for dry white toast with a tiny slice of chicken. and 18 euros for about 50 grams of steak tartare. cheapest potato chips on the planet served on the plate. nothing remarkable at all to anything we ate. they are cutting corners and pinching pennies. we were bummed b/c it really looked great from the outside. pick something else nearby. 
"stay away. service was poor, however the food was just awfull.. just tasteless and bad quality.. my sandwich was burned and dry.. the club sandwich was with simple processed chicken slices and old vegetables.. and there was a spider in the food. worst food experience in netherlands so far."
"this restaurant has great food and the view from the terrace was amazing. however, service was awful. there were 6 tables and 2 waitresses serving them, so it wasnt super busy. after we ordered wine and water it took them over 20 mins to arrive. a few tables next to us were not cleaned after the guests for the next hour, whilst waitresses were chatting to each other at the bar. it could have been such a great experience if it wasnt for the service."
"food is not fresh, service very unprofessional and unrespectfull, the room is dirty and you can see an open kitchen full of young students not even 20 years old "
"this spot is really posh, it was my first time in amstelveen but it is really very much to be recommended compared to crowded and dirty amsterd "
ordered some oysters to start and followed by the quality meat. meat was indeed of good quality but its a bit overcooked. ordered medium rare but seemed it was a bit more to the end of medium well. but it was still tasty as the meat was very flavorful. the ambience was good and you could have a nice talk with your friends over lunch sitting by the canal. 
"came here for lunch ... friendly service, nice setting, enough privacy, and the food was good but not great. however, this restaurant has done enough for me to be back."
last evening we were taken to this waterside eateries by some business colleagues who live in the neighbourhoo 
"we came here with a group of 4 colleagues on a beautiful evening and were able to sit out on the terrace, the location is lovely next to the river. unfortunately we had really bad service (we had to ask 3 times for a bread basket and ended up waiting over 30 minutes for one), the food was very average and rather overpriced. stop in for a drink but look elsewhere for food."
"waiting, waiting and waiting! seriously, 15 guest at the patio. how hard can it be? great view and good food though, ill give it an other shot some time."
"went there for lobster friday. what a disappointment! they brought something totally different than what we ordered. hardly any lobster at all while still asking lobster based prices! we were so disappointed. when we complained they totally brushed us off. the guests at the table next to us had the same experience. we were all disgusted by their attitude. will not return! too bad, because the location is really nice."
"nice quiet area, beautiful terrace, friendly staff. menu is not huge, fits on one page, and has nice combination of fish and meats. prices are definitely on high side! the special of the day were the mussels which were ok. not the nice big juicy ones you get on the mediterranean cost, cooked in white wine and bit of garlic and spices. these were on the small side (half as big), rather dry and can taste either white wine or spices. just found some raw carrots and other minced veggies on the bottom of the pot. this place is to enjoy nice al fresco with a cute view, not for amazing seafood at reasonable prices."
have been for supposedly quick lunch in a beautiful setting. we arrived later than planned ( got stuck at pharmacie due to another snail dutch customer service there- arrrrr ) so had no choice but to sit in paardenbu 
"this is a place to visit in the summer, with the terrace next to the river amstel. we arrived by ship for lunch. one of the grandchildren was in a wheelchair, staff was very helpf "
"i am surprised about this restaurant. only 1 piece of bread per person. i ordered 2 appetizers, 2nd one as a main course and this was really no value for money. small portion, only the beef tartar, no vegetables, no bread/ carbs. we got a small cup of fries and salad to share. my colleague had fish, which was ok, but his vegetables were cold. surprising for a restaurant in this location. we got the coffee and tea for free because of the cold sides, but i am still negatively surprised about the lack of value for money....."
"nice restaurant located in a nice place. food is ok, but nothing special. service a bit slow. i have been for dinner and was dark due to winter, but i expect to repeat the experience to valuate the surroundings."
"i was treated to a meal by a friend who is now a bit of a local. he was very excited to bring me to the town of ouderkerk. however, forgot that the nights were drawing in so i did not get to see much of the town itself, although what i saw was pretty enou "
"on a summers day, an attractive proposition... food mediocre and overpriced,   but then were in rich folks territory.....  :-)"
we had lunch at this place. really poor food quality for high prices. very small portions in combination with simply bad quality. we are definitely not coming back.
"this was unplanned trip and we booked last minute. restaurant at capacity so clearly popular. there are distinct areas - outside under enclosed cover , bar area which is very relaxed and slightly more formal restaurant area. we were in bar area. distracting that had tv but personal preference. lots of children’s toys so clearly family friendly. parking was an issue evening we wen "
no words can describe filth as experienced with the staff throwing up food in the sink in front of the custom 
"cant recommend, the staff wasnt friendly, could say a bit of arroga "
"the slowest service we have ever experienced in any restaurant, anywhere in the world. had to cancel our dinner order after waiting over an hour for it. (80 min). the manager was very apologetic, but the damage was done. those around us had equally long waits. perhaps they need more wait staff, and things would change."
a very normal dutch restaurant as you find them everywhere arounf amsterdam. at 21.30 staff was obviously eager to get us out and go home.
restaurant colijn is located in bovenkerk next to the amsterdam forrest. the large windows at the rear of the restaurant offer a great view on the trees. the wooden floor and new furniture with comfortable seats create a nice atmosphere. the open kitchen in the central part of the restaurant gives you a peek into the kitch 
"two big tiger prawns on top of my ravioli were not cooked well. i only noticed it when i started eating from the tail part: hoping that another was cooked. however, both were artially raw. i ordered a decaffeinated latte but came out with a cappuccino. but the serving lady insisted that i ordered a koffie verkeerd with warm milk while pointing at my cappuccino which everyone could recognize that it was a cappuccino. with the price that we paid, i did not find my experience pleasant."
"i went here with a friend today to have a nice lunch. we were enchanted by the bbq and definitely wanted to order something which would be bbq’ed. it took quite a while to be served but we ordered a bottle of rose and sparkling water. problem nr 1, we received still water but as it seemed to be from the tap we thought it was just to keep us hydrated (no other water came to the table). we ordered 12 oysters, delicious (though really expensive) an "
"i take business guests there quite often. food is really great but the waitresses make you feel like your in the army or jail, no one smiles and it takes hours for them to do anything."
"we went there with our friends from abroad on a tuesday with a reservation. we had some nice drinks on the terrasse. though our friends wanted to have some cocktails, they dont serve. what this place does serve are some nice tom yam cun crockets. our friends loved these. we had some really nice dishes, though the bouillabaisse was sold out and the turbotine was sold out. so we had to think of something else. very pity. the dishes are are well served, though the french fries were too dark brown and the mayonaise was awefull. the service did vary a lot. there are some some really nice waiteresses but also some really grumpy ones. hope you lucky to get the nice waiteresses."
"we went to the winekitchen at sea for a dinner with friends. the restaurant is nice and welcoming with a large open kitchen. the menu looks appealing, but the quality of the dishes is moderate. the langoustine was overcooked, the meat of the vitello tonato was not tender and the bisque too sal "
"my first review of this restaurant was nor very positive. since then i visited it twice. the second time it was better but not outstanding. the third time was the worst. my main course was fish and chips again, the most straightforward culinary challenge one can imagine. what was served was a travesty of this simple dish. first it was almost cold. second, the crust was everything but crispy and the cod inside a fluffy mess. after complaining, i received a refurbished version which was still substandard. my fellow dish companions received better stuff fortunately. the best part was good verdejo wine. once more, given the available alternatives nearby there is no good reason to have dinner in this restaurant."
"while the terrace looks nice, weather conditions forced us inside. unfortunately inside the tables are very, very close and the noise level surpassed that of a chicken shac "
"this new restaurant is situated in the tastefully restored former police headquarters of amstelveen. it is positioned as a fish restaurant but the menu features also some meat dishes. we heard some positive comments about this newcomer and decided to have a try for ourselves. taken together we were somewhat disappointed by the food. there was nothing specifically wrong with it but also nothing that made it remarkable. overall much more taste could have been added. the codfish in my fish and chips tasted hardly at all and the taste of frying was the only noticeable thing. the same held true for the fish dishes of my companions. the wine was ok and reasonably priced. if this restaurant wants to find a specific niche in the amstelveen culinary landscape, a lot work must still be done."
"it is probably a part of the holiday park and managed accordingly. friendly staff, but they dont put much effort in their service. food could be better."
"firstly, we were disappointed and surprised that we could not have our evening meal served outside on the terrasse despite the temperature of 30 degr celcius at 7 pm, and this restaurant being located in a family resort with a view of the playground, swimming pool etc. inside the restaurant, it was stifling hot with no air, and no windows to open. secondly, when we decided to have something to eat anyway (it was the only place for miles) - and the staff graciously lagreed to serve us something on the terrasse because we were celebrating a birthday, and the birthday girl could not sit in the restaurant in that heat without getting ill - the staff/kitchen messed up our orders and instead of serving our fish on a nice plate with salad and french fries as we had ordered (in perfect dutch by a dutch person), we had our fish delivered in black plastic containers - and although the outer layer/the batter seemed warm, the fish itself was cold/frozen and completely raw. the staff was very apologetic and immediately took the food back to the kitchen, and replaced it with something else but im sad to say that it isnt really a place i would visit again, apart from having a beer or a sandwich at noon. then id rather cook back at the summer house nearby with the few utentsils at my disposal. the staff did what they could to provide service, it definitely was not their fault that things turned out the way they did. perhaps a kitchen too busy or over-heated?"
"the food is not good, but this is typical for the netherlands restaurants. this one is not worse than others. at least they have a variety of food and not only pancakes."
the menu is kind of average dutch local with some international touch. service was for such place good (fast and with the smile). our kids focused more on small boutique for ice drinks and ice-cream.
"quiet night when we were there, very attentive service. good choice of food and nice standard.  a good family  atmosphere,."
"we were served vegetables with our warm meal but the vegetables were uncooked and cold!! when we talked to waiter, he called the cook (we were seated close to kitchen) what is the worst part is that the dishwasher was from poland and he spoke great english and we discovered that this restaurant regularly hires illegal students but promises pay and then takes a huge chunk of money out of their salary by claiming it goes to taxes but they never gave any papers. this polish student said he had two more days left to work and he was desperate and heartbroken but had no other choice. risk if you work under the table. scandalous that the owners [wendy something] exploit these people. never coming here again. "
"after a long walk through the beautiful area, we were very hungry and wanted something simple to eat. we passed by this place and saw that is was quite busy already. must be a good sign we thought.. and we were not disappointed. we were kindly welcomed at the door by one of the waiters and despite not having made a reservation, they had a table for us. we sat at the bar though. the restaurant offers the choice of a 3 course menu or a shared type of 3 course menu. the difference is that you can choose a second starter and main dish, which allows you to taste multiple things on the menu. the menu was simple varying from carpaccio, soup and salads as starters to burgers, spare ribs, pork medallions and fish. the portions were big.. and we were stuffed after our main courses as we had also taken the shared starters. friendly staff and very reasonable prices! they have a room upstairs for special occasions, an open kitchen and also a heated terrace outside. "
"while being in the process of moving to vorden we had dinner here twice. in both occasions, the food was good. nothing bad to say about that. but the waitresses are living in a wrong dimension. they treat you as if you must be glad you are allowed to sit down here. the first time we thought it was the mood of the day of the particular waitress. but since the second time, another waitress behaved the same, it must be the atmosphere. not our taste of behavior. a pity for them, since we like to eat out and vorden is our home town from now on. "
"pleasant place for lunch with outdoor sunny seating. but painful wait for menus was followed by painful wait for food, then for account, and finally for change! food was average, nothing to complain about really or to compliment."
"having visited this restaurant a dozen times since 1968 when visiting holland, our last experience for dinner was a big disappointment. people who came much later in the dining room were paying their bill while we were served our main cour "
"my brother-in-law had visited meraqi yesterday and talked to a staff member in charge a day before our visit. we were looking forward to a wonderful birthday lunch with the six of us at one of their round tables. “no problem, sir. your round table is reserved”, the man in charge said. unfortunately we were denied our specific table reservation the moment we came in today at 12:15 by one of the waitresses: “ we never book fixed tables sir, sorry”. but….. we left meraqi speechless, flabbergasted and angry. this is so unprofessional!"

"gringo’s has known times when the interior was innovative and food surprising. those times are disappearing: ambiance lively but too loud and bad acoustics. steaks lower quality than they used to be, and smaller than they used to be against higher prices. salad must have been prepared and held in the fridge for a long time: no fresh salad leaves, taste of refrigerator humidity dominating, the masking with thick dressing did not take that away.fries were nice but served not completely hot anymore. price-quality levels have gone out of balance too: price too high for what is offered. we said the salad was not tasting ok and not nice. we got apologiesand she would tell the chef. no solution offered and were fully charged. after almost 20 years of returning to gringo’s, we will have to let go of gringo’s."
we had a meal here spoilt by an obnoxious waiter who refused to give us tap water despite us having a full meal with drinks.
"used to be smaller, then they expended and became the mexican version of tgi fridays. unless you were invited i suggest you look for something else."
"nice ambiance, good menu card, good seating. the food was good but firm priced. service team did a good effort. not all served food on the dishes matches the woridng/description"
"from the outside, the villa ruimzicht looks really impressive. but the rooms cannot meet the expectations. the room weve had was covered with dust. so was the entire hallway. another point of criticism was the service in the restaurant. they were quite disorganized, and in my opinion, the food is slightly overpriced."
"we had meals on two occasions here, once on the terrace (burger/fries - c.19euros) and then in the restaurant. burger was nice but i think a little overpriced. our restaurant meal would have been very nice had my lobster (24euros) been served hot. it was only warm so i had to send it back. friendly staff.

"the dishes can only be order every 20 min and max 4 pieces. portions really really really smal, they say its an all you can eat restaurant but thats not how it works. so if you came here to have a dinner you gonna leave still hungry. service quite rude. i will never come back here again. if you are looking for a all you can eat restaurant you should go somewhere else "
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di

used to visit on a regular basis because dh loved their gyros dish and i liked their lamb chops. i understand their is a new owner and we were not impressed on our last visit. the gyros was bland without the usual spicy garlic flavour he is used to and their lamb chops were no longer accompanied by a thyme flavored sauce but with a brown sauce with a definate maggi flavouring not an improvement at a 
booked for five and no table available when we arrived. table for four was made to fit five food not great but acceptable staff not attentive and one member of staff was very rude to one of our party. avoid is my advice
"i would give this place 5 stars for location, presentation and service. the food however was a let down in my opinion. located just across the old harbour with free parking opposite it and fairly easy access, limani is set in a prime location. the waiters were professional and went the extra mile to cater to our dietary requirements. unfortunately the food was hit and miss. the salmon was great and the salad bar had a reasonable selection. the grilled chicken however tasted like it had served time in the freezer and the rice like it had just come out of an uncle bens bag. it might have just been an unlucky choice for us but im not sure id come back again. "
it seems as if this restaurant/bar only has locals and is only willing to serve locals. the staff was surprisingly rude and unhelpful and it felt as if this bar was only meant for their usual customers.
hele slechte ervaring vanavond. extremely poor experience this evening - avoid at all costs 
"having eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and enjoyed good food and service, we were disappointed with our experience on this most recent visi "
the view is excellent but the food expensive and not special. its too expensive in relation to the quality you get and inside the restaurant it looks poor.
"the restaurant itself is nice inside, lots of seating and has an outdoor dining terrace. nice sea views. nice & friendly service. all good. to be fair, we didnt order entrees so maybe thats all very good...maybe. we had the lobster soup (too watery with rubbery lobster pieces-not worth the 12 euros theyre charging) and the spargel soup (ok but nothing to brag about & there were strips of ham in it-like the lunch meat youd put on your childs sandwich). both were less than average. this gave us pause to order anything else so we didnt. "
"for an italian restaurant, i would say on average the food was disappointing. the main course fish was very good, the arancini i had as a starter were tasteless. wine was nice and the staff are very friendly but not very experienced and didnt seem to have much training. location looked nice but we only got a seat in the bar area as the main restaurant with the nice view was full."

"we attended a family diner for 15 people and we were seated in a corner, at 1 table. for this pre-ordered diner, they served several starters and main courses. dessert was served on plate. it was really a pity that the plates were so large from size, that there was hardly any space on the table. the service was friendly and checked upon us regularly."
"the food was ok but no more than that. we ordered calamaris and parmazan  fries and the calamares were small and overcooked, the fries were good."
dogs are allowed on the beach from october. after a long beach walk we treated ourselves on a delicious apres-walking drink in the beach restaurant kaap-duin. the interior is reminiscent of a xenos store. but who cares

"realy a lovely place to sit and have a drink.   the kitchen needs attetion. no love or passion was put into it, feels like we were at ikea.  we would go back for a drink, but not for dinner."
"scouting out some family history we found this place on our way back to amsterdam. unlike most places in amsterdam, not much english spoken here (and sadly i dont speak dutch). so make sure you have your translator on your phone! we needed it to read the menu. our food was good. for some reason took longer then everyone else, but we were in no hurry. im sure a great place in the summer with a great view of the water. there were a number of locals there, so guessing pretty popular. oh, almost forgot. they are very pet friendly here apparently. dogs are pretty much allowed everywhere, even restaurants."
"the service is a catastrophy, we were there several times... we were forgotten by the personal, other costumers got seats before us even if they came later, orders were served wrong "
"visited frequently. for drinks only and a uitsmijter. the food was okay but it took long to be served. drinks took way too long to be served out, although there was loads of waiters walking around. not very collaborative. they are friendly to kids, that is nice. inside this building is a not atmospheric, it is high and like a factory. tons of tables and so empty. put up some plants or other loungy decoration. i wont go there for eating out at night. outside you look towards the beach and water but when you look to the left you see factories. it is a weird location, also the outside of the building is weird because it looks like a factory, the terazza is big and too much tables and wooden benches, no cosy corners at all :( . if you want to go somewhere with cosyness dont go here..

"the beachclub has an excellent location right on the beach of lemmer. we had dinner there last sundaynight and it was very busy. apart from the noise we enjoyed our visit. the food they serve is quite okay, although one of our party was not impressed with the mackrel. the rest of the meals were fine. we found the staff very nice and attentiv "

"a pleasant lunch ruined by a waiter ignoring us, being rude when he spoke to us and then who slammed down the card reader on the table and was incredibly rude towards us on the whole - would absolutely not recommend if you are a tourist looking for some usually lovely dutch hospitality."
"an average to good meal at this restaurant, we felt the portions were small for some of the starters and mains and we had to order additional chips as the 2 small bowls between 8 of us were not sufficient. the meal lacked vegetables and again not enough was provided for 8 people. i ordered the ribs which were good and i had a large portion. very friendly staff and good service. we had 2 bowls of stewed rhubarb with our mains which we thought was unusual and wondered if it was a dutch thing ? "
"we visited here due to the excellent reviews, but having looked at the menu we decided to only stayed for a drink rather than a meal.  the menu has exactly the same fayre as most of the other average restaurants in lemmer."
waiter cashed and cleaned neighboring tables without saying a word or even recognizing me - after 15 minutes i le 
"the location of this place is really nice, right on the water. we only had drinks and snacks and they were fine. but the service was made me give only 3 stars. one girl was okay but the other girl had no idea what she was doing. "
"when you are seated next to the kitchen and the owner/manager is constantly yelling at the staff, when you have to wait 45 minutes between starter and main course, the food better be outstanding. and when it is only good enough the experience is utterly disappointing"
"although its evident the chef has a sense of cooking, the overall taste is soooo disappointing, the  ingredients leave you with a sour taste in your mouth, worst part, the arrogant based on no knowledge whatsoever attitude of the waiters, very cheap ,"
"we come to this place once or twice a quarter for lunch or dinner. food has always been good, but recently ever more ingredients, tastes and decoration are crammed into and around tiny bits of food. often there’s more sauce or foam than actual food and yesterday was the first time we started to give up on the show. the staff are ok but insist on breaking up the guest’s conversation every time they appear with something, and whilst we respect what the professionals do and deliver, there should be respect in the other direction as well, and that is not always apparent. the concept is somewhat informal and that is fine, but at this price level one expects something close to perfection with a touch of informality rather than the other way around."

"i had lunch at tante koosje, 11 december 2021. yes quite a while ago, so why i am writing a review now ? because they are so proud of their micheline star, but not acting like it. i had lunch there the food was nice but not unique i have eaten at better one star restaurants. the service was not michelin worthy, it was far away from that. so i wrote a constructive email on 11.12.2021 about it, expecting a reply, which i did not get. then i wrote an email again on 11.01.2022, with a little reminder that a reply would be appreciated, guess what, i did not get a reply. so now after a couple of month i feel lets leave a review. as mentioned already the food is nice, but the price you pay is not only for the food, but also for the service and the service sucked in many ways and does not come near to a michelin star restaurant. there are better one star michelin restaurants where you could go in the netherlands. so my advise safe yourself a trip."

"a very charming location. we were sitting outside but it took too long before we were taken to the table. tasting menu, some fish, some pigeon, ice cream i remember. probably too much messing around with the food..too complicated...without great result. certainly not bad though. wine pairing nice but too much explaining from the brochure without really knowing. water pouring with constant dripping, serving a bit too much from the hip. approx 100 euro per person. "
"dining at tante koosje is always, no fail!, a treat. no exception this time. however, there is bound to be a however. my friends and i also in treated ourselves to the accompanying wine menu. this we should not have done. it was an interesting selection but served with aplomb and supposed knowledge that did not reflect in the taste of the wine. hence the average this ti "
"we were greeted, seated and then just sat there waiting for someone to come to the table to offer us a drink or any form of service. eventually we had to ask for a drink, which came. when my wife and i had both finished our drinks we sat there for a good while before we again had to ask to be served. we had been there for around 30 minutes before the menus came. the lady that served the wine felt it appropriate to just pour the wine and start telling us about it, interrupting our conversation and talking over us. it felt as though you were an imposition to some of the staff by being there and each of us at the table felt the same way. i have had better service at burger king than displayed by some of the staff, the food is not as good but then you dont have to pay 350 euros for it. for a michelin starred restaurant i expect much better, and for the price there are much better restaurants out there."
"we were incredibly disappointed. we asked for the menu and were shown the blackboard with 2 starters and 2 main courses. we chose 1 of each and received the most flavourless food ever. i ordered 2 glasses of wine each of which was 2cm full if that. the food was thawed, unseasoned. just tasteless. the waitress didnt know what was what (ie we asked what was the crispy thing on top the carpaccio) and just gave a stupid look. the guy couldnt care less. terrible staff. terrible food. and they charged us 91€ for it. i asked what happened to the price on the blackboard and they said oh that is just if you order a surprise dish. obviously not made clear. avoid this place. we tried 2 others beforehand but one was closed for vacation, the other just closed for whatever reason. "
"excellent food. service needs improvement. lovely restaurant in idyllic town of loenen. unfortunately we had to ask 3 times for our wine before it was brought to our table.....the other table,  obviously regulars, received much better service."
"i held my wedding luncheon here with just a handful of guests in 2015. although it was just a small luncheon, my husband and i arrangd this as our only formal celebration. i had arranged some music to be played which the owner agreed to in advance. however, when the time of the event arrived, there was one other table seated at the time with two guests where the owner saw fit to give full his attention and cater to their opinions above ours. i had a wedding with music i couldnt hear and the owner remained preoccupied with sitting by these two other guests the entire time instead of being pleased that two people from other parts of the world chose his restaurant to celebrate their special day. when i asked to be able to hear the music, he chided that i must be considerate of other guests. i was not immediately angry and paid the bill in full but when i later attempted to connect on social media to possibly discuss my issue, i was ignored. a wedding is a once in a lifetime event and so caterers have a responsibility to uphold whereas his attitude is completely unacceptabl "
"a good host knows when you want his attention and when you want him to stay in the background. the host in this restaurant does not. dining here meant we had to pay attention to unnecessary explanations, including some ridiculous wine-for-dummies talk, while we were here for a family gathering, spending some precious time together. the food actually wasnt bad."
"great location just opposite of the waterbus stop, nice terrace on the waterfront. busy reastaurant, you must not be in a rush because it takes time to get a coffee."
a nice place with a pleasant view on the river noor. a bit away form the town. it is a modern place. in summer with good weather you can enjoy thenice terrace. now we had dinner. it was a bit busy. it took some time befor oredering and receiving your meail. the quality of the food isgood but moderate more a cafetaria than a restaurant prices are certainly not low.but it was eadable.simple eadable and expensive that is our conclusion.
"lovely place, great view. need some improvement on the fo "
"for lunch its extremely busy, which is good. my omelette was excellent but my wifes tomato soup was from the ah can or alike, which is not what you expect. service is good and fast. prices are very reasonable"
"as well as the service is ok, the menu is very basic and the cooking is medium. there is an opportunity to enjoy a buffet restaurant, the time-frame is rather too short if you are not advised to get in as they start the time-fra "
"they probably tried to create a unique high tea but the strange flavour combinatitions they put in every item do not work. i did not enjoy the food.the amount is more then sufficient so not a total loss, but i wont be returning."
the restaurant is open until 11pm. the menu felt a bit uninspired and i settled with vegetarian ravioli. the ravioli was really good but why was it served with french fries and pan fried and broccoli with cheese as sides? the ravioli filled me up and to be healthy i tried the broccoli but it had a funny taste. 
"this restaurant is nearby and provides a place to catch up with a friend : its not pretty, charming, warm or homely. its not welcoming. its clean and comfortable and the music is not too loud. its a pragmatic choice and food goes from ok to bad. service in the main is of the same quality as the cooking : dependant on the moods of the waiting staff and the chef. my beef salad last night was composed of large chunks of cold steak that had been fried and then coated with uncooked curry spices. some chewy cubes of dried apple, one (1!) walnut and a dressing that was under par in every way: meager and tasteless. my friends goat cheese salad was a huge wheel of cheese on a bed of leaves and way too many untrusted hazelnuts. the gluten-free bread rolls were the only really good part of the meal. my consolation in this case: geez-louise its only food. but a waste of good opportunities and once again the wish to kick somebody there into gear"

"we had a little family gathering with 5 persons at said restaurant. my unlce made reservations for a quite space which should be avaible but when entering the restaurant we were refused acces to that reserved space. instead, we had to dine in a large room with many other people. since several from our small party have decreased ear functions, that situation made it difficult to have a proper conversation amongst the party. since the generation of elderly usually does not complain, the restaurant manager gets away with such bad treatment of clients. i do not feel like ever going to that restaurant again!"
"van der valk restaurants used to be known for their fairly cheap food, albeit from questionable quality; restaurants for the masses so to speak. nothing wrong with that of course, yet some of them have changed their formula to a more upper-classy/business alike establishments like this one near rotterd "
had a caesar salad and fresh orange juice here for lunch. they have a nice terrace and the service was fast and  
great food for a fair price. the setup is a bit old fashioned and crowded but we had a very nice mail with the kid

"a nice location by the water, attractively decorated in a nautical style. we went here for lunch and were recommended the traditional lunch-plates. they sounded quite nice, but when the food arrived it was disappointing. three slices of bread with 3 fried-eggs, plus some cheese and ham. also it was rather expensive at +/- 10,00 €. perhaps we should have ordered from the regular menu."
"we went there with a family group of 10. the restaurant is decorated with all sorts of memorabilia, old records and other garbage. the menu is overloaded with would be funny titles of dishes while the food is mediocre, salty and greasy. the resuartant was packed with locals."
this restaurant appears to be run for the convenience of the staff. it has a prime location in the yacht harbour but doesnt offer any services for the visiting yachtsmen. the last time we went was for lunch. we were told to find a table at the back of the restaurant and the waitress continued laying the table for evening groups at the other side. when she finally came to give us a menu we had waited almost 15 minutes. the interior is gimmicky as are the menus. the food is no more than average with an unpleasant taste of cheap cooking oil on the burger. a real waste of a pretty location. they could do so much more with it.
"this restaurant is really unreliable. ive had some very enjoyable evenings there and also some forgetable ones. in august this year i had dinner there, excellent crab starter and mussels to follow. good service and a thoroughly enjoyable evenin "
"we visited kasteel wittem some years ago and had lovely meals there. so, we booked and looked forward to enjoying a special meal. we started with champagne and were served two half glasses of it. after about 20 minutes we got an amuse which was nice. and then it took one and a half hour before we got our starters, which by the way did not require any cooking as we had oysters and a cold selection of foie gras. it then took another half hour to get our main dish, fish. the menu announced asparagus but they were replaced with endives. it was good but nothing special. the wines selected by the sommelier were nice but the quantity per glass was ridiculously small. on the other hand we were supplied with loads of water and bread while we were waiting for the food. we gave up and decided not to have any dessert or coffee because we had no idea when it would arrive on the table. the service was chaotic : we were given a second amuse which in fact was for another table, various waiters came back with the same cutlery, we were offered the menu card after we had already ordered our meal ... a big disappointment. and there was no attention given to adherence to covid precautions and rules concerning contact tracing. we were given one of the glasses of wine and the water for free, but really the evening was spoilt and the restaurant not at the level it should be given its prices and style. "
"foo was very good, but very little choice. we were warned on entering that the souschef was not available and that they have only a very small menu. but what they had was very good and as it was excellent weather we sat on the terras with a beautiful view."
"we had lunch at kasteel wittem... the quality of the food was superb and very tasty, however, we had to wait a long time before the waiter took our order (there was no-one to be seen on the terrace outside the castle). also, people who arrived after us, were served faster (and even got their drinks faster). a bit disappointing but the great food made up for it!"
"our food was amazing and totally worth the money. unfortunately the service wasnt at all. no menu in english and no effort to help us translate the menus, had to wait an eternity until we could order our food and in the end to pay. no one asked us if the food was good, no smile from the waitress. although we loved the food, the service had a bad aftertaste, not sure if i would recommend the restaurant.

"a friend an i went for dinner. the staff is friendly but the food was not not impressive. the taste of the steak was good.. but after chewing at it for a while my friend and i swapped the meat. his schnitzel was plain, fortunately with the garlic butter it had taste. when the question got asked how the food was i could say ok.. that thanks to the side dish(rhubarb with cherries) and the sauce. i would come again for a drink.. not for the food .. "
"food is ok especially sea food always fresh but not very imaginative menu. in itself not a bad thing but the prices are a bit too high for the quality of the menu. service is very variable and not consistent, friendly but not very professional especially in summer time. definitely a case of not to much competition around. been there several times in 3 periods in 2016. summer and winter"
"we got our starter, my bread was ice cold and so hard i nearly broke my teeth on it! then we waited 45 mins till we got our main meal! did they forget us? then when it did come my partners mussels/clams were mostly all still closed and further down the pan even cold! my meat was luke warm and the sauce cold. but the chips were hot! the lovely girl serving did take some drink off our bill, she was nice and helpful, but saying that..... we would not ever go back to this restaurant."
"youre ready to spend a bit more than the dinner value: food is good ambients nice but if youre hungry you might be disappointed by the portions. that being said, the bill well meets a meal which makes you asking for a doggy bag."
"dreadful espresso. apple pie had likely been frozen, anyway soppy and tasteless. would not recommend visiting this place."

we had lovely evening here with our family.we did find menu bit limited and most of us ended having burgers as not too much to choose from.friendly staff and very helpful.children enjoyed a swim in lake and play area popular.outside heaters on for diners wishing to eat outside.
"a nicely located restaurant where they serve a nice meal! went there recently and enjoyed the food and drinks we were served, however the service was mediocre. friendly, but not very professional. long waits, not addressing our wishes in regards to what was served when. apparently they understood this themselves as well as we were offered coffee on the house at the end of the evening to compensate this lack of attention."
"the place has style, the sea is a few meters away, you have outdoor tables but unfortunately the service it’s bad. i asked for a caesar salad with chicken. i started to eat and noticed that there were also slices of fish or sardines.i cant eat any seafood, i immediately stopped eating and my appetite was gone, the waitress approached her, i explained the situation very kindly and she really didnt care, she didnt take the plate away, she didnt apologize, she didnt ask me if i was allergic or treated to solve the problem, he only said ok maybe it’s problem with the kitchen and left, then i ordered two cocktails with the same waitress and when the runner arrived with the drinks he gave me a bottle of beer in which i indicated it was not correct. when i requested the bill the they never removed a bottle of beer and the salad from the bill, so check your bill well before paying for they only say the total amount that was supposedly consumed. i asked the waitress to remove the drink and plate of food from the bill. dont even tou "
"amazing location,and very busy on a good day,but overpriced with rude service,no customer satisfaction at all, if they cant handle how busy it gets then serve less,the food was blunt,burger overcooked, as long as customers do not say nothing they will not change anything, i will not be returning and i wonder why people cue up to get in this place !! i have to say drinks where okay though!! "
"the weather was great, but still it was a rather unpleasant experience at aloha. perhaps it was a bad apple, but the service from one of the waiters was painful. grumpy, uncooperative and on the verge of what you could call rude. pay attention to the bill, as it could be different from what the menu says (not in your favor). burgers are meh, meat cooked well but the bun was pretty dry. will definitely not be coming back here!"

"great location, cute beachy interior but horrible service, i realize its a beach bar but we ordered a burger which when served was rare, asked politely if we could have it cooked a bit more, and were told thats how the burgers are served like it or no "
bio burger used to be the best burger you could get in wijk aan zee. now they dont serve them with wedges anymore and hard bread.
"we like the place but seriously, 1h15 to get 3 burgers and a salad, ordered at 6pm?  not ideal if like us you have children. staff was very friendly though and offered us drinks."
we had dinner in the fletcher restaurant. the waiters advized us to take the deer. the food tasted good but we wondered if it really was deer. it tasted more like a regular sirloin of a cow. nevertheless it was an enjoyable evening

this was the first time we had been here with friends who lived local. the service was ok when the food arrived we were disappointed. we felt the food could have been better for the price we paid. we were astonished to be charges 6 euros for tap water as in england it is free. there was also and overcharge of which our dutch friends discovered. it goes to say we will not visit again.

"food quality very poor. soggy spring rolls, gluggy dum-sum, beef dish prepared with deep-fried beef off-cuts. not really restaurant quality. servers also inattentive and unqualified.  terrible, disappointing experience all round."
"julias kitchen restaurant is situated within hotel de bilderberg, a four star hotel. the restaurant area doubles in the morning as the hotel buffet breakfast lounge. from a restaurant, associated with a hotel as de bilderberg, a soothing and refined atmosphere with friendly, polite staff and good food may be expected and generally julias kitchen succeeds in this endeavour and keeps the bilderberg flag flying. but the devil is in the details. some examples: when it became apparent that we wouldnt order wine and water, the waiter refrained from removing the wine glasses and water glasses from the table, making the table surface rather crowded when our drinks arrived. furthermore, when our second round of drinks was served, no fresh glasses were offered, but we had to poor the drinks in the used glasses, causing my beer go flat. no problem in a diner, but in my opinion not ok in a restaurant in a four star hotel. the same kind of observations about the food. while there was generally not much wrong with the food, ingredients used in the dishes didnt match the promises made on the menu. the ceasar salad my partner ordered was not prepared with anchovies, but some kind of sour fish, not contributing to the overall flavour. in my starter, instead of parma ham, another kind of cured ham was used, tasting like the cured ham sold in italian supermarkets as crudo nazionale. furthermore, the warm smoked salmon was reheated so rigourously, that the fish was cooked. dont get me wrong. we had a nice soothing sit-down with prompt, friendly and polite service, and the food was really not that bad, but once more, the devil is in the details."
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "

"its a nice looking restaurant which offers thai food. we tried two different chicken curries, sadly both of them were extremely dry. the flavoring of the dishes was good, but the dryness of the chicken ruined them. the staff was friendly but a bit slowly. this resulted in an average overall experience and not receiving value for money here."
"good choice if you are around arnhem/oosterbeek. the food is made with fresh and colorful ingredients. taste of food is pretty good, portions are small in size and dessert card is limited and overpriced."
"we hadnt planned on going to lemon grass, however, some business took us to oosterbeek and we happened to notice an advertisement we were reading while waiting for our appointment. our business contact recommended lemon grass as a good restaurant and so we went. we eat thai on a regular basis so we were anxious to find out about this restaurant. when we walked in around 18.00 hrs the place was empty and for a moment we started to get a bit worried. we noticed the reserved signs on every table and it didnt take long before the restaurant started to get pretty packed with other guests. lemon grass also do take-away by the way. we ordered a couple of dishes and they came very quickly (a bit too quickly actually for our liking...) and they all tasted very good. service was friendly and efficient. the restaurant itself is not particularly inspiring for a thai restaurant but okay. (i guess we have been spoiled by sombat in antwerp which is our favorite...) we couldnt finish all the food and the waitress was so kind to organise a doggy bag for us so we could continue to enjoy lemon grass at home. all in all we left satisfied and by that time, the restaurant was full. next time in oosterbeek, we would certainly consider to go back when in the mood for a good asian dinner."
"we had heard about this restaurant and were really excited to go there since more than a year. that was maybe our mistake, and therefore our disappointment was bigger. the food is good, average, but for the prices that they apply you would expect better quality. it might a matter of choice, maybe we did the wrong one for our dished, but when you pick the special of the chef, you expected something special....not something common. the first dish was good and presented in a special way, so that was nice, but for the rest it was not the best. we wont go again, because they are many other thai restaurant and this one just didnt attract us enough to go again."
"dining here was a spontaneous decision. i was served very well. as a vegetarian, i found enough things on the menu to make a meal: omelet, soya beans, seaweed salad, miso soup. i was sorry the place was so empty. i cant explain that! i hope business picks up and the restaurant can stay in town."
we selected this restaurant because it offered a different menu than what we usually find in the dutch restaurants in this region. it was also one of the few italian restaurants whose main menu item is not piz

"we order take away with a value of 72 euro`s. at home we opened our favourite dish, sha sieuw (no 122 on their list) we all smelled right away this dish was off. it smelled a bit sour. i informed them by phone immediately and they asked me to come by right away, but we (our family and guests) were all ready to eat. no apologies at this point. we agreed to come over after dinner. when we arrived, the female owner took the bag and she and the make owner were smelling it and even took a bite. when we asked them what their take was on this, she casually replied with, we are going to judge it. no apologies at this point. then she started to make a lot of assumptions, that we were probably didn’t want a new dish because we were already full. i explained to her that paying 72 euroand our favourite dish being off with guests at the table, took away our whole experience that sent the value of 72 euro very fast to the worst moment of the day. she offered the money back for the dish and gave me back 15 euro`s. at this point i really felt i was not heard at all and no empathy whatsoever, still no apologies. the male owner also joined the argument by saying that they and all four cooks ate the dish and it is the same as always. now we got into an argument, because the dish was clearly off. for me this is something that can happen and if they could admit that no problem, we will be back the next time, but this denying went a bit too far. i said come one this is not ok, if you deal with complaints like this i will never come back here. the male owner replied with, ok that is fine. i said no that is not fine at a "

we stopped here along the water to grab a quick lunch. we ordered the dual hamburger dish to share. it had to be the poorest quality beef i’ve had in the years i’ve lived in the netherlands. walk further into town for a better place to eat.
"terrible food. dry chicken, bad bread, bad fries, the food was really fat. at least the ambiance was nice. i’ll never come back here."
"very low quality food , i said i am allergic to garlic and ordered a tomato soup . it was full of garlic . the hamburger was very strange tasting ! i still feel sick. the service was very slow and not careful!the price too high in both senses !!!"
i went here hoping for a beautiful meal with family and friends. i am actually vegan so my dutch daughter in law asked if there could be a meal for me. when i go to a restaurant i certainly dont expect anything special and am happy to eat fries or a garden salad. i don’t ask for much. most places can make that. the chef came out and said that he couldn’t make anything vegan. then he proceeded to say he doesn’t agree with veganism and asked does she wear leather shoes or bags. what a pr**k. all i wanted was food not his opinion on my lifestyle choice. would he not serve other people for their choices??? and by the way i don’t wear leather. i was not aware of the conversation until later so my response to him is ..... you are paid to cook and your patron pay your wage. if you continue to insult people you will not have anyone to cook for.
"we have to wait an hour and no excuse strange, i think it goes too well and now they forget hospeteley it was a pity that only one hour of waiting was ridiculous"
"i went to this restaurant recently for lunch. the decor is very nice, and its a clean and well dressed place (considering the antique building). the staff is very friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice. the food was alright, its the same old dutch lunch (read sandwiches), but with a little flare. i had a panini with brie and pesto sauce and my friend had a chicken wrap. this is just window dressing for the same old dutch lunch. if youre in the mood for dutch food, this is a good place, but sometimes you want something other than sandwiches."

lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
first visit since the re-opening and we were not disappoint 
the buffet was split up to three different rooms and it was pretty confusing.  the prices were high for such disorganization and our drinks werent filled very often.
"the quality of the food was quite poor, the dessert was warm as it was standing outside of the fridge too long. there was no wine menu, house wine it is. even if you want to pay extra. there is a playroom for the kids what makes it ok. due to this low quality we expected low prices and that is not the case."
"there is a vast choice of food at this all you can eat buffet and we found it a little overwhelming. you would have thought a serve yourself buffet would be quite explanatory but we were confused from the offset. we followed the queue and took a plate. in front were various raw meats and vegetables (most were unfamiliar to us). seemingly you chose the combinations, took them to the chef and were offered a choice of sauces to cook it in. needless to say my combination tasted awful and my friends not much better. obviously we could have left our poor choice and tried another one but we dont waste food so put it down to bad choice and not the fault of the restaurant. the meal came to just over 50 euro for 2 meals and coff "
"service initially slow. my meal: mosterdsoep | zalm | stokbrood excellent. kalfsentrecote* | italiaanse klassieker | seranoham | seizoensgroenten | salieboter very poor due to high fat and gristle content. dessert average. did not receive an after dinnner despite this being ordered! another member of our group received her main course incorrectly, she was compensated by receiving a plates of french fries. in all honestly this is he first time ive experienced problems at this restaurant. it will be a long time before revisiting."
"i celebrated my birthday here with my family on a lovely summers evening on the outside terras. we all enjoyed our meal and the service was good. we also had the retiral reception for one of our employes in a recently available reception area and this was as we are used to from eetcafe 1837, friendly and attentive staff and tasty well prepared finger food. this is an all round establishment and i would recomend it for family occasions"

fast food kind of food. kebap with a style. still kebap. it is not bad. but it is not superb. lots of food fast served. baklava is expensive and not finest.
"nothing wrong with this chinese restaurant, other then it is very middle of the road, with very ordinary and average dishes. quality is ok, no great shakes"
especially the month menu is more than oke .  you get value for money.  a great environment and very friendly people working there
"very nice eatery with outdoor area, friendly and fast staff. portions rather small (both the appetizers and the main dishes) and for that rather expensive (11€ and 17€). the ribs were great, the loempias so-so."
"pleasant night in this hotel. comfortable beds, rooms clean. we appreciate the family room with 2 separated rooms (1 for parents and 1 for children). bathroom clean as well but a little bit old. very good breakfast !!!"

we had dinner for four with my sister and partner while staying in the hotel. the food was good and reasonable value. the service was slow and a little dysfunctional. my sisters wineglass was stuck to the table to the extent that the waiter had to prise it off using a knife. the waiter managed to spill some juice from the serving platter on to my sister. the sparkling wine i tried to order had not been chilled. need to improve management.

"the food here is a great disappointment. the starter was good enough but the mains were poor. i had dover sole, about 3mm thick and it came with a type of tartar sauce like that which you would get out of a take away packet sauce. my partners chicken satay was very average. not what you expect for €19.50 and €17.5 "

"when you choose to travel by car for a visit to tapas restaurant olijf, the multilevel car park boekenberg is especially suited for the purpose. the pedestrian way-out drops you right behind the restaurant and the parking fee is moderate. the web site of olijf contains this excellent advice. the restaurant is located in a historic building in the voorstraat, one of the streets that are left over from the old village spijkenisse. the atmosphere of the restaurant can be soothing, except that there were somewhat more flies in residence than you could wish in a restaurant with an open kitchen. later on the evening one fly decided to have a bath in my wine glass. brrr... furthermore, the somewhat irritating music over the speaker system clashed with the restaurant appointments. it is my opinion that music in shops or restaurants is mostly there for the pleasure of the staff, not for the customer. service of the staff was friendly, but mechanically. the dutch are not very good in hospitality and serving customers, not like italy, where hospitality and serving customers is an art. furthermore, our waitress omitted to bring clean plates for the main course; a grave mistake. it was also difficult to attract the attention of the staff. in the end it was impossible to get our bill presented to the table, so we decided to take our coats and ask for the bill at the counter. but how was the food then? olijf is a tapas restaurant, where you share with your table companion divers small portions, ordered from the menu. generally, the food was well prepared. sauces are to be avoided, they come out of a bottle. i must say the slices egg pancake with salmon and cream cheese filling were delicious and also the pork medallions with bacon wrapping were cooked perfectly. however, later on my digestion system told me that possibly the chef of olijf uses flavour enhancers in the preparation of the food. maybe salt msg. (also called ve-tsin in chinese restaurants). i may be wrong, but i am very sensitive for this additive. what shall i say about olijf. it can be a very nice restaurant when some easy improvements are made by the management. but they do something right. the restaurant was busy on this weekday and mostly with regular customers."
it is a good place with a fairly tasty food. tried tapas and it was fine. i didnt pay so i dont know the average per person. portions are not big so heavy eaters need to watch out.
"maybe they had an off day, but the last time we were here for a tapas surprise menu, the fish was tough and the meat was cold. and as it was not that crowded, it was strange that it took far to long to serve the fo "
"what a surprise to find in a small village in rotterdam area a tapas restaurant, very nice place and very nc tapas, too."
we were really surprised by the great quality of the food choice as well as the service given. nothing to be left to desire!!
bland oriental food in enormous portions. the restaurant promises more than it really gives. the only aspect worth while discussing about is the average pricing.

ive been here several times. the price / quality is good. the place is always crowded so reserve in advance. big tables for larger groups. they stir fry your selection of veggies and fish / meat with a sauce of your choice on the spot.

"dissipointed no decor as asked and the food was not fresh and when asked for steak tbone etc it was not available due to a 3 oclock sitting, but when making reservations this was not mentioned"
"the service was great and the atmosphere good. i guess one should not expect exceptional food at a buffet restaurant, but i am still surprised at the very high rating other people give the restaurant. the quality of the food is good as a buffet goes, but cannot compete with a restaurant preparing individual meals to order. so if you want to eat huge quantities of average food at a reasonable price, this is the place to go to."
"overall good food, but as we went there, the place was crowded all the way and as a result, we had to wait in long queues, separated from each other, because almost everyone in our group wanted other types of fo "
"for a restaurant in a 4-star hotel, this was a huge disappointment. we both ordered the ribeye and asked for it to be medium- cooked. the meat was barely cooked - it was blue! we sent them back to the kitchen and when they returned, they were still not medium; more medium-rare, and very tough and string "
"i have visited this place mutliple times now and it is always a different experience. sometimes the food is really good, and other times it is not very special. last weekend we had a buffet and i do not think that the quality was so outstanding. also the service was not great as they forgot to bring us drinks a few times. all together a very decent place that can give you a very good evening on a good day. sometimes we are just a bit less lucky!"
second try and we find staff inattentive with poor knowledge of the food on the menu. unable to prepare a steak to order: medium rare was first blue then overdone. chips are nice.
"i have experienced the service at this restaurant many times and it is just terrible, you have wait and wait for someone to come to order, to ask for anything and even for the bill, i see other reviewers have experienced the same thing , hence my question is if the management in this hotel is sleeping ? dont they want to acknowledge and resolve there inadequate service ?? gm pls wake up !!!"
"staying in the (slightly isolated) hotel this was the choice for dinner, and a good option to "
"i ordered one of the best steaks on the menu, but it was drenched in some type of tomato/pepper sauce that was distasteful. will not eat here again."
"it took forever before being served for (at first) just a coffee. same story for the second coffee. then i ordered an omelette and even though it wasnt busy at all it took a really long time and i nearly had to cancel the order because i had to leave. the omelette itself was the most disappointing ive seen in years, drenched in oil and way too greasy. when trying to pay the bill it was again the same story of not being noticed at all. overall a very poor and disappointing experience and i really have to be out of options before i will ever visit this place again for a business meeting or otherwise."
quality is going down in both the hotel and in the restaurant. food was served very quickly and fairly expensive for the quality. i had to ask several times for the bill although the waiter was playing with his mobile just in front of my table. really not the best restaurant
"recently we visited the restaurant, and there was no table available in a light area. we asked for a table near the window, however most tables were occupied by flexworkers who installed their laptop or backpacks and were nowhere to be seen. the manager, when asked replied that it was no problem to them because they welcome everyon "
"i write this title reluctantly, because generally i have come to appreciate the van der valk restaurants. thats why van der valk nieuwerkerk was selected for dinner with friends for a celebration. i never visited van der valk nieuwerkerk, but recently i had a satisfactory dinner at van der valk drachten (see my review), so i anticipated another treat. but, what a disappointment. looking back on the visit, the only conclusion i can draw is, that the staff lacks pride in their profession. reviewing the starter, carpaccio, the salad leaves and other ancillary ingredients were piled high on the sliced beef to give the dish volume (i advise the chef to refresh his memory by reading the original recipe by guiseppe cipriani), but what was inexcusable, that the capers where not properly rinsed, introducing the sharp taste of the brine into the dish. the main course, pork with cheese was prepared unimaginatively with some cheese melted over a small portion of pork; the dessert was crème brulée with amaretto taste: the amaretto bottle had probably only shared the table with this dish, and the dish was prepared apparently without dedication, because the bottom part was waterlogged, rendering the dish unappetizing after a couple of spoonfuls.the service of the staff was wooden and programmed, without attention to details and without showing genuine hospitality. as example, the platter with vegetables was shoved on our table well out of our reach. regarding the ambiance, i have mentioned in reviews of restaurants, that is was too dark, necessitating the borrowing of reading glasses or employing the flash light app in my smart phone to read the menu properly, but here at van der valk nieuwerkerk i found the light too intense and harsh; combined with the high ceiling the ambiance was not to my liking; furthermore, the chairs looked comfortable, but they lost their appeal after the two and a half hour session. i an sorry, but i would book with van der valk drachten without hesitation, but i am going to avoid van der valk nieuwerkerk."
very unusual way of preparing high tea. waters not very well trained. i would not recommend this location for a family high tea.
had dinner last year here and had a great time. took our friends here last weekend. everything was wrong took 20 mins to get a wine menu 40 mins to get the menu. after starter we waited another hour to get the main. the main was cold. fillet steak was tough. potatoes were cold. only thing that was hot was the fries. felt sorry for the waiter because people were complaining on another table. hope for them it was a one off. waiter tried his best and gave us a bottle of wine. so sad because lovely interior. would i go back. no. felt very embarrassed in front of our friends. 
"perron offers a nice bistro experience where you can enjoy very nice food. great grilled meat dishes, fish and salads with some suprising choices like a bouillabaisse and awesome desserts. not an extensive but well chosen wine list and very nice and caring staff"
"proseco foscari, stale, no bubles from what appears to be some from ope left over. bottle. minuscule portion of ravioli, oily, tasteless. 8 pieces, 10, luckwarm, oily and tasteless. menu 15, but charged 16.50. seafood pasta, a lot of spahetti, many shells but some with nothing in it, empty shells. oily, little taste. very limited menu, no pizzas. dutch beers not available. one of the worse dining experience and we left halfway, paying a hefty bill for what was in essence not good food and way too expensive in comparisson with pro eran restsurant near by. they will not see me again."

30.06.23 at 18.30. we had looked forward to visiting the river on our trip from wales to see our daughter - sadly the waitress who took our order and served us made us feel uncomfortable. from the moment we ordered our drinks and requested tap water not bottled she lost interest.. as we are not dutch speaking we asked her to describe some of the dishes for us.. she wasnt really bothered and didnt try to hide it. food was nice and the restaurant was nice but our evening was spoilt by the waitresses attitude. 
"chicken satays were quite poor and nothing like proper thai satay. they appear to be deep fried……. the pad thai was pretty good (7 oo 10) although the large lettuce leaves are a needless addition and actually put me off a little - wilting lettuce…ugh. service was good. 40 euros pretty steep i thought (two beers plus starter and main). in west london, i go to thai bites which is 5 star and then some and for same meal i am about 25 pounds by comparison. probably lucky to not get two stars tbh."
it was very hot inside as there is no air con. there were a few fans but we were told they would have to move the one directed at us if another table came  
"ordered takeaway after i got this thai restaurant recommend. having been to thailand numerous times, i know how hard it is to find food and authentic spicy thai food outside of thailand. often food isn’t spicy, even when explicitly requested. even in thailand, thai chefs are wary when you as for ‘thai spicy’ as a foreigner. but if some explicitly asked, one could assume one knows that thai spicy really means very very spic "
"the food is good. however, i ordered food several times (to go). after waiting for almost an hour, there was no food, because the ticket with the order disappeared.. this happened already twice!!!"
"we have moved in to voorburg from amsterdam at about the same time that thai fresh was established. we had been to thailand a couple of times not long before we moved and it was our favored restaurant from the outset locally with its wide range of dishes, real thai complexity of taste, and great atmosphere. we went there several times a year for several years. about three years ago they have started to add more and more sugar to more and more dishes, often to the point where it muffled all other taste. in these last few years, dishes such as the tom yam koong, the tom kha kai and even the krapauw dishes have become unenjoyable as a result, at least for us. one of the few dishes that most recently seems to have escaped the sugar influx is the laap moe (which is still a gem). currently it is our recommendation to avoid any dish which contains coco milk or is labelled hot/spicy, there is simply too much sugar added to these to be able to experience the underlying taste, in our opini "

"very tasty thai food, good ambience. but the hostess was not too friendly.. probably because we went without reservation or because we were the only one with kids.. i recommend to owner to hire staff who have a passion for service otherwise let down the hard and good work of kitchen. "
"did eat here 1st time, had a nice table, waiting time long, english menu promised but forgotten. small portions for such prices. not any dish had an authentic taste except the fish cakes. i have lived in asia for decades and many times visited thailand and other thai restaurants around asia too compare how thai food should taste. will continue to search if the hague area have a thai restaurant cooking more authentic."
"nice ambience, but i thought the food overpriced. i chose the phad thai kai € 17,50, basically a noodle dish with a few pieces of chicken, i asked for it with coriander and was a bit surprised that for the few sprigs of yellowing coriander i had to pay an extra e1,5 "

the food was good but the service was really really slow. had to wait 20-25 minutes just for a drink.

"ive ordered the same dish twice over a period of a few weeks, because my co-workers insisted on getting thai fresh.  i got two completely different dishes! i mean tossing in a few cashews doesnt make whatever you have left over a chicken cashew dish?"
this is “thai” food with a dutch flavor. no authentic thai food here ! situated/based in a not so much exciting neighborhood.
"had a monday night dinner with a business friend. nice wines, decorum a bit stiff and outdated. we choose the 3 course menu. fish carpaccio with boiled salmon to start and wild hare / stewed beef. then dessert. food was good, but not excellent. i had expected more. "
a pleasant restaurant in an historic house in voorburg.  the park setting is allows you to walk along the tree-lined paths and along the canal.  there are also rooms in this historic mansion.

"i went with my friend/colleague for a dinner on a friday evening. personnel was very friendly and kept our table even if we were late (but we did call to inform them). we chose the surprise menu, 3 courses. the serving speed was ok, but the portions way too small for that price. we paid a total of €100 euros for: a small bottle of water, 3 glasses of wine, 2 menus and 1 coffee. again, the food itself was good but once home i ate something..."
"first of all let me say that the 3-course meal was excellent, especially the starter with salmon... having said that, the restaurant apparently cannot handle several special deals occuring at the same time. we went here during restaurantweek, but had vouchers for another deal which was different from the one served as part of the restaurant week. we should have been given the choice of 3 dishes for all 3 courses of the meal, but instead we received the same 3-course menu that was part of the restaurant week deal. we mentioned this at the beginning, but were told it was the same. my husband looked up the conditions when we returned home, and not only were we right, they had also overcharged us for the restaurant week special they served us instead. we contacted the restaurant by e-mail about this, but havent received a reply so far. so, what to think... great food, but lousy service?"
"had dinner here with a larger group. the service was good but the menu and food was average, actually disappointing. the reason for the verdict was that the dishes were so bland."
"the restaurant looks good but thats about it. the ingredients were bland and boringly cooked. nothing impressive. pretentiously trying to be gourmet/fancy but the only thing they did was decrease the portions of a regular home-made meal. the service was very weak (they stored our coats in the kitchen because they didnt have space elsewhere, but didnt warn us about it, so it was with much surprise that we left the restaurant with our coats smelling of cooking!). would definitely not go there again."
"the food is great, but the service could be better in a more classy place like this. it is near the railway station of voorburg, so easy to reach."
"we were looking forward for a nice evening and were excited to dine in this high ranked restaurant. when we got there, we were greeted without any kindness, rather as if we were not welcome. when we were seated we got a little amus-bouche which waa very good, but we had to wait for the menu for at least 10 minutes and ask 3 times for a bottle of water. in my opinion, for a restaurant in this category, absolutely unacceptable. the lady that served the bread, which came in three different types, wasn’t really able to explain the difference and seemed more annoyed than willing to do her job or at least be friendly. i decided to go with the 4 course menu, the first course was lobster and mackerel which was good, but already a little disappointing, as the portion was really small and the sauce was too sour and i missed the light sweetness of the lobster, what makes it so special. the white wine we ordered, a light summer wine, had room temperature and just put on a small table next to us, so that we had to ask the service (several times) to put it in the refrigerator again. the quality of the food decreased from course to course, just like the service’s motivation to make an effort for us to have a pleasant evening. we then decided to forgo the desert and just stop this nonsense. the whole evening was a pure disappointment and absolutely not worth the money we spent there!! "
the food and the service are really good. but: when i left the restaurant i was still hungry and so was my (female) colleague. from a three course meal of round about 50 euros i think i can at least expect not to be hungry anymore.
"this was our third trip to villa la ruche. pleasant atmosphere and friendly, efficient service but the food was rather disappointing as was the case during our second visit last year. we ordered a 5 course surpise menu this time. the third dish with sweetbread and biff was very tasty and very appealing. the remaining dishes lacked character and taste. in addition, the lobster served in the second dish was partially raw. i doubt very much we will be going back."
"we walked in at 12noon as stated opening hours at the door and was asked if we wanted to dine in or take away. my reply was take away and the lady at the counter said they dont have that kind of chinese food and they target mainly the caucasians. well, my skin is yellow and so is hers! thanks for the heads up, we missed chinese food thats why we walked in and left with loss of appetite!"
"we have been here several times, always had a good experience. this time however, there was a different sushiman (due to holidays?), which unfortunately made for a very poor meal, not even matching all-you-can-eat-suahi quality....disappointing"
"although the food was good, will be very reluctant to return over the issue of providing tap water when asked. wed told the waiter we had biked (thirsty) and asked for tap water. we noticed a reluctance but were given two small, two thirds full glasses water. we also order sake to start with. when one of us asked for more tap water out came an already opened bottle of branded water. nothing was said that we had to have this and couldnt have more tap water. the other of us later asked for tap water, and again an opened bottle of branded water was put on the table, no explanation. the owner needs to understand that such things makes patrons not want to buy other drinks (at higher prices), although would have if tap water had been provided, nor buy extra food, nor return. so they really do miss out. and it leaves a bad feeling. not good practice."
i decided to give this restaurant a try since i stumbled upon a groupon for it and i thought why not! how wrong i was. 
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone.

"a great location and nice food, but that is what you expect in this price range. the service is friendly, but lacks professionalism. the menu and wine lists are rather short. we had an enjoyable evening, but i felt trapped in a concept (including fake flowers and an artificial smell)."
"even though the food was still tasteful, the overall experience was very disappointi "
"private parking, nice view in the restaura "
food was okay but not the price you have to pay for it.  wish the former chef stayed...... the service was average.
though it is nice to have this kind of restaurant in voorburg it does not distinguishes itself from restaurants of the same concept in neighbouringthe hague. theres a lot to choose from the menu but the dishes are a bit bland and do not wow you. overall it is just adequate. the price is okay and so is the service.
"it use to be good in the past, but not anymore, we went there many times but today was the last one. taste, quality and service are much more lower, also my daughter become sick once back at home! de sushimeisjes den haag is our new adress much better!!!"
"yes, all you can eat, but oh oh oh... sushi all tastes the same dish with beef was only curry and no beef to be found (and when we mentioned this to waiter he just said: yes, that is beef.).."
"the wosrt attention! the service is really slow, the waiter is arrogant and pedantic, and make you wait and wait for the food so you get full and dont eat much paying for at least 5 rounds."
"good tasting food. they offer all-you-can eat special on weekends. nice selection of alcoholic drinks. be aware they tend to miss a dish or two, if you order 5 or more in one go, especially during weekends."
this restaurant is a nice and good variation on the asian all you can eat concept. it is all about tapas. you can choose from cold and warm dishes. both meat and fish. veggies lovers will be dissapointed here. there is not much choice for them. though the mushrooms in garlic sauce are delicious! you can have cocktails for 5 euros but better order a bottle of wine or a can of sangria. the gambas and the fish dishes were that day exceptionally good. service is friendly and adequate. this is a fine restaurant to take your kids to.
"we like tapas and mezze a lot and eat them at home and outdoors in nl and many other countries. this restaurant has an all you can eat formula, with low quality - mostly fried- food, unexperienced staff and huge cocktails filled with soda. this is not dining, but stuffing yourself with carbs and fat! "
"the service was great. food was up and down, the dishes arent all the same size. therefore you didnt really know what to expect. they make you pay for everything that is leftover. would have loved to try more different dishes. the beenham was a bit dry. but the garnalen en kaas kroketjes were amazing! "
"sushi was really very average, but the yakitori and spring rolls were good. ordered a carafe of still water for my girls, only to be told later by a second waiter that they dont do that (?), and i had to order a bottle instead. later saw it was 6 eur which is a bit of a needless rip-o "
restaurant was very busy with not many staff as it was kings day would have like more snacky things on the menu
"the current fusion menu is less interesting, for example you cannot find a real japanese soup, i could only get something with chicken bits and cream. forget about the exquisites dessert you had earlier, like sesam ice-cream"
"this dining experience was the worst ive ever had. the wait staff completely ignored me, i had to call them over to bring my menu and then again to order my meal. after waiting 40 minutes i asked them where my food was and they rushed to give it to me. it was gross. the miso soup was so salty i couldnt eat it, even after i tried watering it down. the seaweed salad was too thick and not seasoned properly. the california roll didnt taste like it had crab, it tasted like tuna fish from a can. it was awful, there is nothing good i can say about this experience. if they offered to pay me $50 to come back and dine there again i would decline, it was that bad. i wish i could give this less than one star, this place has no business calling it a japanese restaurant."
this is a hotel bar that started serving sushi a few years ago. ive only visited ad a guest of the hote 
"we actually ordered sushi for take out. it was okay sushi and the staff who helped us was okay as well. in this area there is not a lot of choice, think they want to be a bit to fancy."
"we ate in this restaurant twice and on both occasions the food was glorious however was badly let down by the service which was touch and go. the staff were very attentive to begin with but then seemed to lose interest in what little diners they had, perhaps it would be better if the hotel had a separate bar instead of using ozzo as one."
"i asked if they could make a vegan dish cause there was nothing on the menu. i was told they could make a beet carpaccio with salad, so i ordered it. my friend ordered the tomato soup with bread from the menu. when the order arrived it wasn’t a carpaccio but a simple leafy salad with beet in it. my friend was told the tomato soup was vegan so she replied that she ordered the soup from the menu (with cream and pesto), i asked why they told me they would make a beet carpaccio when there was a vegan tomato soup available. anyway… waitress came back with two little bowls of cream and pesto and my friend apparently had to make her soup herself at the table. she sent it back to the kitchen. no new soup came and no apologie "
i had invited my friend for lunch here but was very disappointed by the quality of the food. it was quite embarrasing since she always takes me to nice places.
"a restaurant for young people, fast, loud  but very good food for a reasonable price. not being young any more, we still enjoyed the ambiance and, of course, the food."
"we booked a dinner with my husband and my son, sold as live cooking buffet... its just another of those all you can way place with a very large variety of food where you can eat everything but the quality isnt for sure something remarkable."

"the lunch menu was a bit boring. i had a beef carpaccio, which was reasonably executed, but the portion of bread was very small. service was ok, but a bit slow seeing at they seemed to have 6 serving staff. i wouldnt go again as there are better options in the area."
the drink arrived when we had already finished the appetizers and i had to ask for the napkins twice after the first course. fairly good dishes but with definitely not involving combinatio 
"evening meal with colleagues, menu choice is limited and service is ok but not quick..... you have to make sure that you grab the attention of the waiter otherwise you will sit there all evening being ignored potentially. food quality is good...."
"if you came here as part of a keukenhof coach tour or wedding festivity, both happening during our meal you probable be quite happy but we came to meet with family to chat and relax. both food and wine menu ok. i had carpaccio to start, dutch lamb with white asparagus (in season) for mains and good selection of cheese for desert. considering price level service was patchy and not out waitresses fault just overloaded - 3 requests for wine list and having to wait for water glasses to return from washer before we could have some. nothing especially local about the experience. "
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
great cuisine so the chef must be a great cook. but the restaurant staff and the restaurant (atmosphere) itself was just okay and is apparently not able to cope with the chef’s cooking standards
"we had dinner at bij robbert last weekend with a couple of friends. the starters were average with not a lot of taste, but the tuna, that 3 of us ordered was overcooked. two plates were taken back and were replaced bij veal tournedos. this was good, but 2 of us had to wait and the others were finished when our food arrived."
this place is perfectly located on the beach and there is a large parking place on the other side of the dune 
it was a nice afternoon and we had been cycling so wanted to stop and have something to dri 
we stopped here during a long beach walk for a drink and a quick meal .. 
"there were not many guests. the restaurant was maybe 40% occupied, but we waited 1,5 hrs for our food. just pizza and salad. so nothing complicated to prepare. the waitress knew it would take very long and did not tell us, even though we were with a toodler. the food was ok. no seats for children."
"lovely location on the beach, really handy for the us but the service was dreadful. we had a pizza, ok ish and tipped a lot. after paying and having drinks we went outside to sit and look at the sea. within 2 minutes, the same waitress came out and informed us rather rudely if we wanted to stay we would have to order. we pointed out we had just had a meal and drinks, apparently that didnt count... the place was completely empty... wont be back again"
"we had dinner at this restaurant with a large group. luckely we had a reservation, the place was packed with tourists, which gave it a nice holiday ambiance. we ordered different kind of dishes (meat/ fish/ kids etc) the starters were served within 30 min and a 45 min later the main meal was serve "
i didnt expect these tastes..i didnt like it at all..i dont know what happened..the last time i visited the restaurant was before two years and all the plates was amazing and could pass by my esophagus but unfortunately this time i have only to say the worse with lots of water..
"have been there a few times, its all about the terrass and waterfont, food and service are modest at best and recently serveica has worsened . so if the terrass is closed there is no reason to go there actuaaly. this time ecven at 22 celcius and bright sunshine at 4 pm the terrass was cloesd as there had been rain around noon... the staaf refused to serve the terrass even a glaas of wine was not granted . indoor , again, real mediocre, nothing to really go there....."
"this is an interesting town picked out as one of our day trips from utrecht. friday was market day,and as the sun was shining, we noticed the tables in front of the town hall, and as someone was leaving, we managed to get a se "
restaurant in the middle of the city in old cellar. dinner was fine but nothing special. atmosphere is nice apart from akoestic which can be better.
located under the old city hall. small dishes for the same price. nice bar for drinks for happy hour. the high tea is very nice to doe with your girlfriends or family
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
"good place, friendly staff, quick service. food is of the quality you should expe "
"pretty much as all the other japanese restaurants i have eaten in the netherlands. quick service, nice environment, nice shrimps and musse "
this place is where you should have your pre-cinema meal. they serve a wide range of asian tapas which satisfies your need for instant food while having only 45 before the movie. price is right too..
"after a visit to the adjacent cinema we decided to try azuma. i myself am not so fond of sushi, however, they have non japanese dishes too. the restaurant has an all you can eat concept for 25 euros during a maximum of 2,5 hrs. according to my wife, the sushi was good. i tried different other asian dishes which were good as well. service was swift and friendly. major draw-back though is the frying smell throughout the place so when leaving the restaurant we were very happy we didnt have anything else planned and our cloths went into the washing machine straight away upon arriving home. okay for once but would probably not return."
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"i will not be returning there, which in itself says something..after schlepping yourself upstairs (i have asthma but the elevator is only for freight and... invalids only with companion. the food is very average, cooks do their work with little interest. the only active one was a young waiter that removed your plate and empties at the speed of light. for icecream you get a minuscule cup and a revolving counter which you are not allowed to use yourself so you have to wait until someone shows up to serve you at 2 scoops max.. it simply does not feel very hospitable.as a plus i will say that the place is very clean."
it is a pretty large place up the stairs. catering to bigger groups eating there while on a business event with bowling in the cellar. the food is ppentiful and okay quality.
we visited this restaurant with colleagues. the quality was ok but not very special for a japanese restaurant. it is an all you can eat restaurant with also general asian food. the location is easy to reach close to the a27 highway. good parking.
"decent and fresh food, ideal for families. self service formula with on the fly teppan yaki and good chinese cooks that swiftly make your fresh chosen ingredients."
"its a nice concept and in general is a nice family restaurant. but in temrs of the quality of the food, the price is too high. it wasnt a bad experience but i would not go back."
"huge chinese/asian/japanese kind of foodhal, all you can eat concept so bring an appetite. do it yourself means gathering your food and let the cook boil it (wok or teppanya "
ok they have teppanyaki besides the wok. sushi choice is minimal. service average. for people who can eat a lot its nice value for money
"this restaurant has a typical chinese/japanese/asian wok restaurant. there are different stations of buffet which are devided not only for starters, main menus and desserts but also cook or uncook main menu. for 1 price you can eat all you can, but you still need to pay for your drin "
"good food, nice people, but no respect for any covid-19 measure. no 1.5m distance between tables, no masks, no qr  check, nothing. a true insult to the public and other restaurants who do respect the guidelines."
"my family-in-law goes here all the time apparently. they are not foodies. the decor of this restaurant looks beautiful. but its kind of restaurant with an identity crisis. is it italian, or greek? cause they are known to be italian (in my family-in-law at least), but really the menu is greek, with also one dish of risotto (which then makes it italian-greek?). food is a lot and greasy. not very satisfying. i liked the tzatiki and pita bread, but thats really all i liked. "
nothing to get excited about. pretty good quality mediterranean meals. the staff are very friendly and welcoming.
"we went out for a family dinner to this restaurant. while the welcome was very friendly and warm and the staff and the manager very friendly we were disappointed in the delays in serving our food. the presentation of the food was super but it took way too long for our food to be served and when it finally did get served it was almost cold. that spoilt everything! my husband expressed his disappointments directly to the manager so we hope that the next time we go there, if we do, the serving of the food is well improved!"
we went to plein 22 for a quick dinner on a friday nig 
"this is a bistro, so trying to rate it accordingly. the food was ok, the service was bad. had to wait very long for drinks and food and impossible to get someones attention, so ordering was a challenge!"
been here before the food was good but service so so. thought would give it another go with some business associate 
"this is the worst asian restaurant that since we moved here 2 years ago. we were around houten and checked an asian place to have lunch. ming en ming came out with good reviews at tripadvisor which i am very surprised .it was 12.15 and the restaurant was totally empty , no reservation signs on the tables and the waitress showed us the worst place to sit :) darkest table next to the kitchen. when i asked to sit around i sensed she didnt like it but we sat anyway . we got open buffet kind 18.50 euros round menu which i defiantly do not recommend . we could not find anything to order .it was too much for the poor quality . never again."
followed my own advice from nov2016 and skipped the grilled items.   got #62 rice noodles with curry (singapore noodles) again and it was excellent.  #134 california roll and #67 chicken stir fried noodles were just ok.
my grilled items ribs and chicken satay had zero caramelization and were very poor.  the stir fried dish and side noodle dishes were excellent.   service was good.
food was ok but wirh very slow and cold service attitude. the food was ok but the cold 2 service attitude make us feel very unfriendly :(
they are true believers in mayonaise. mayo on my salmon. mayo on the broccoli. mayo covering my plate. mayo mayo mayo. kids menu is a gloried snackbar offering. my pasta looked sad and was crying for help and respect.

"the breakfast is in the average. a good choice of sweet and salt, and the quality is also in the averag "
"i have been here quite a fee times recently for business meetings, and the uitsmijter i had for lunch was the worst i had ever had. apart from that the service is appalling, every single time i have to get up and find a waiter to pay the bill, and then they have to find the waiter that served us to take payment, so that takes about 10 minutes waiting around. not impressed!"
"great breakfast buffet lots of choice and fine quality of products. dinner very big portions not so high qualit, i would prefer smaller portions and improved ingridients"
"we ate at van der valk houten on our way to the theatre in utrecht. the ambiance is quite impressive. we arrived rather early and service was attentative at that point in time. when it became busier, it started to slip away. when we got the sole that we ordered and which was cut by the staff, it turned out it had not been cooked well enough. when the bill came, i had the impression that it was more expensive than what i am used to and would expect from a van der valk. all in all, not bad but not impressive either."
"we were in this restaurant business wise and before the meeting we wanted to have a dinner. the menu is still elaborate with trendy looking dishes and names. the service is rather poor with students with no hospitality experience. the dished served consist of the fish or meat with ample serving of french fries. the fish dish ( vissers palet) was a variety of fishes mainly too salty pangasius fillet, scallops etc. with some rather poor looking garniture. for business ok but not a place to have a special occasion"
"we went out for drinks and then dinner here. drinks outside were great, but the dinner after was, well, a ridiculously long wait. and then they were not able to serve as at approximately the same time, so when the first few people had finished their food, the next would receive their food, and there were 3 rounds like that for 12 people. they should have just told us they cant cope with groups!the food was fine but bad experience. "
"for a late lunch; first cold food (kroketten ment to be hot). then second try; overdone close to burnd (‚revenge of the kitchen crew?). no apologies from the waiter also. maybe they are better with other food, or just a bad day"
"very disappointing diner. 4 meals were not ok. too basic and fish was definitely not fresh. when talking to the staf in a friendly way, the waiter became quite defensive and claimed every day they fresh ingredients."
"located between driebergen and doorn, the restaurant is favoured by my wife because of the beautiful out door seating in their well maintained garden. the food can vary widely from fabulous to not so nice, but in general the flavours, presentation and quality are better than avera "
"the restaurant looks nice, both garden and inside. the card promises much but judging by the little we ate, not really . we arrived at 19.30 a monday night, restaurant not even half full. three persons serving. two young girls and a gentleman that seemed to be the boss, only him took the bills. both the girls and the man disorganized, going around without paying attention to guests or having their own agenda, unknown . we sat at a table for two, just one napkin on the table. this was disregarded but we were asked at once what we wanted to drink. the waitress seemed to think that people should just drink wine by glass, seemed very astonished when my husband said that it is possible we order a bottle. she asked if we wanted merlot or pinot noir.... a little tired by the exchange we ordered two glasses of merlot, very average, and very little quantity. then we were left to linger over our wine about 20-30 min, our desperate tries to get some attention were cut short by the gentleman who plonked on our table two small rolls of serrano ham with goat cheese, and told us that we will get the menus but first eat this. a napkin for my husband was provided. the menus arrived by and by. i ordered a veal broth and a fish cooked in the oven sicilian style and my husband a ravioli and red fish(?) fried. after about 30 min our staters arrived. mediocre food, looked better than it tasted. and now our glasses were empty, we managed by and by to get some attention and another two glasses of red wine. and then another wait ....till 21.30 h when we were fed up and asked for the bill as we could not wait any longer. our empty dishes were still on the table...we paid a bill of 81€ for 4 small glasses of wine and two starters, one was noted on the menu 6,75€ , the other was about 10€. do not go to this restaurant, the lack of professionalism and the lack of shame in asking full price for an order that was delivered only half is unbelievable."
the location is along the main street of doorn. we did take away but we should wait for a while as there was a long queue of people who also did take away. it seems that this restaurant is popular by the local.
"you get a list/menu and you can choose 5 snack size items, 5 times. you have to finish what you order. lots of choice, chinese and sushi. we really enjoyed this."
"this restaurant serves as the only chinese food restaurant in the neighborhood. since decades chinese restaurants in the netherlands have developed a taste that suits the dutch well. this restaurant understands this tradition well. the babi pangang is as it has to be. the take away service is good, friendly and quick. ordering by phone is possible and works well. service in the restaurant is friendly. the place is friendly for children. half portions are available."
"the food brings me to this place a couple of times a year. in winter the feathersteak is a winner. for other seasons i havent been able to find a consistent dish to return. their policy of being stingy with the wine bottle tends to put me off though. we fill the glass to the mark, is what the guest is told and charged a hefty price."
"frozen pizza, shameful for a restaurant called italian. glass of water that costs 2.10 euros ... run away !"
"have been  a regular here for years. the house pizza is a favourite. other dishes, all italian cuisine, are at least satisfactory or good. the house wine is plonk, but service and atmosphere compensate for that."
"the restaurant/brasserie is a bit difficult to find, and you have to know it. it is the end of the road past de zandafgraving. so you do need some kind of own transport to get there (or walk). it is located on the top of the hill, near a small scale holiday pa "
"this restaurant is generally speaking excellent. i was very impressed in the past (before i was diagnosed with food allergies) by the creativity of the chef and great service, i would highly recommend it unless you have food allergies. i am gluten and lactose intolerant and thought they made good food for me, they served me cheap dry bread while my husband got an amazing freshly baked bread. my heart dropped, it did not seem like they were fair or well prepared. it was tolerated until dessert when again they served more options to my husband and i got a lame one with some dry almost burnt puffed rice to decorate the dish…..sorry, this does not fit the level of the restaurant. the cooks should be better prepared for fair options to people with intolerances, i reserved with details on my allergies and they did not deliver."
had dinner in this former brasserie. over the years the restaurant has really upgraded to fine dining restaurant. the service is professional and kind. the food is excellent and of high qualit 
"tasty food, many small dishes. the good tempranillo was a little expensive though. friendly people, service with a smile!"
you know instantaneously when you’re in smallville and a restaurant is failing to mimic a stylish city-like approach to their experience. we walked in around lunch time and aside from one occupied table with 4 guests there was another table with the restauranteur’s admin spread out and a man with a baby pram clearly friends of the owner. no music playing and with the place 90% empty it results in a deafening silent environme 
"recommended by another restaurant nearby we visited this little place. although the accommodation is fine, the food is ...well to be honest not. neither of the courses we had was acceptable. although it looked just fine (back to the seventies), there was a complete lack of taste. i wondered if there even was a chef in the kitchen. if so: find another job."
"amis restaurant is a lovely, quaint place to have dinner with business partners, friends and/or family. staf was friendly, helpful, and we had a nice ti "
"so all in all, right to the point here, this was once upon a time a good restaurant, a great one ev "
this hotel and restaurant is a classic. but also classical restaurants can lose their charms. the restaurant is first of all very hot (temperature) and the ’smells’ are not what you except from van der valk. it is a little bit too much for to less. meaning that the food and the ambiance is not what it should be or more important could be! please go back to the core. make good food. make good drinks and make the restaurant more classy and more up to date. make it happen! i think you can do it
"we received poor service, the waiters seemed to have to many tables to look after. the food was not as impressive as we have eaten at other van der valks."
"let down by very poor sevice. we sat down about 7pm . first course arrived about 8.30 ,a cold starter which was what  i ordered then the main meal came about 9.30, to late to enjoy."
"the food was almost cold, the service good, but very expansive restaurant. i will never come back to van der valk hotels or restaurants!"
"nothing special foodwise, but relaxed for families with young children. average prices, good drinklist."
"the location is ideal. along the highway, middle of the country. good parkin "
"enjoyed a sit down dinner with fixed menu. it actually was good, but for the price paid, it was average. at this price point one would expect something much more refined and elaborate. the hfslg used to have one (from 1981 to 1986 even two) michelin stars, but this was lost in 2018. unfortunately for them, the very good meal that we had was indeed short of a michelin star worth meal. nevertheless, one can get an honest meal and the service is good, albeit slow."
"a beautiful restaurant, excellent service, but the quality of the food was disappointing. we regularly visiting michelin star restaurants in holland, germany, france, spain and japan, but the hoefslag is close to lose their star, as the food, the most important, was below the expectations. no dish was spectacular, a bit without fantasy, no 1 star michelin worth."
"have had dinner at the hoefslag several times the last year. it has been a top-class restaurant for very long. however, i was rather disappointed in the culinair experience. sure when you arrive you are received very courteously, the service is good, but never becomes personal, all more a routine then heartfe "
"after an absence of seven (!) years we - finally - revisited de hoefslag where we were married in a civil ceremony in 2008. so we were full of nostalgia and expectations, looking forward to a similarly sublime evening as way back when. our first impression was that not much had changed over the years; roughly the same decor and furnishings. this could have been reassuring albeit that it had all become rather shabby over time. one single bouquet of flowers unfortunately could not create an inviting ambiance on its own, especially when the view from the terrace includes a humongous, black pizza ov "
"we took our 13 year old granddaughter for dinner in the garden of bistro de ruif. nice setting for a warm evening, competent service, well prepared dishes. however, we were astonished- and more than a little put out- by the fact that we were charged 2 x €6 for 2 bottles of house (flat) water , i.e. tap water that is filtered in house (just like the water we drink at home). this is, in our view, unacceptable for restaurant where prices are already on the high side. the wine list is good, but expensive. when one spends €45 on a bottle of wine, one does not expect to have to spend another €12 on water! i dont think well go back."
"typical mid-priced dutch fare. overly salty, no imagination, unseasonal ingredients (i.e asparagus in october). very unhealthy kids’ meals options."
"have not been there for years.woken up after a long sleep (to put it mildly) used to be classy indonesian, now trying to recover"
"the location is nice, we ordered the most eleborate menu. it was not bad at all. i actually missed a dish containing fish. service was a bit distant. it took quite a long time before we were allowed to order. there was a little quarrel about my coat, when i left. nothing big, but i did nog feel myself appreciated as a guest, did not feel the hospitality you should expect."
"anak depok has for many years been a steady fortress of refined indonesian cuisine. we still like to visit this restaurant to illustrate the difference from the usual toko-fare. prices have gone up through the years and, when visiting with a family, the bill can reach impressive heigh "
"we had the 5 course surprise menu which included small dishes: one salad, one soup, one apetiser, one main and dessert. they were all okey but not all of them tasty enough in my opinion. the prices are good, the service is friendly but if you dont visit this restaurant, there is nothing you are missing."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so don’t plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
"it is a very crowdy restaurant with very great choice of food. there is something for everyone! teppan yaki, wok, hot and cold food buffet, tradional dutch as well as french, oriental and european. the dessertbuffet is awesome. drinks are included in the fixed price."
"even for a wok restaurant, that on average is not the most romantic place to go, this is close to a canteen. actually, ive seen this in china and there it may be acceptable. but this is not china. i expect a bit more. even for a w "
ive eaten here many times when staying at the ibis. there arent a lot of options in the neighbourho 
the restaurant was packed out on the night i was here. none -the-less the food was great. drinks could have come a little faster but seeing as they had a shortage of staff that night i cant complain. would go again. it is a good price/ quality split. enjoyed it.
they have an all you can eat concept.  good food for a reasonable price. no real specialties in the card . common but good!
the food was good and tasty. we would have rated this restaurant 5 but they refused to serve us tap water. every other restaurant we visited in the netherlands was happy to give us tap water with our meal. they charged an extortionate amount for a tiny bottle of still water. its a shame - this let the restaurant down. 
a fine way to do japanese but the food is very salty and the fried tempura type food is a bit greasy.
this restaurant and bar looks more like an irish pub. drinks are good. staff nice. food is nothing special. the steak was basic and not tasty. hamburger looks great but test is ordinary. prices high. nice outside seating. a lot of other restaurants around.
"good hotel, but situated near the highway. it is not the noise, it is the lack of atmosphere around this hotel that makes that it may be better to choose another hotel. beds are good, food is good, service ok. just no atmosphere around the hotel. "

"i went to this restaurant on a wednesday evening as it was recommended by one of our friends. the restaurant is nicely designed, cozy little terrace for an aperitif, friendly service. since the waitress was on her own, it took about 3 h to enjoy the aperitif the meal and get the check..it could have been a bit quicker, we counted a total of 4 tables in the restaura "
"i had a dinner on this restaurant, the place is really nice, and ive liked the food, i tried a plate with 4 kind of fish with vegetables and noodles, the fish was good; tasty, not too much, and the pasta was surprisingly well cooked (its difficult to find noodles well cooked outside from italy .... even if noodles cant be eat as a vegetables sauce !). good solution instead of the usual false italian restaurant that you can find in the town  "
"frankly a disappointing dinner,with our original reservation of table outside ,being rejected “ because it is friday night”. it is so hard to know how difficult covid makes matters,but in july 2020 this was at least open,clean and safe. hopefully standards will improve with experience."
"while asked the reception to turn on the heating in my room in the morning before my arrival, it was freezing in it when i arrived in the evening. since the heating system is more like a hair dryer on steroids as it jus blows out warm air of it, the room never became comfortably warm over night. and having the heating system blow air during the night wasnt a great thing either given the noise it created. bottom line: avoid the place if you are looking for a warm room during winter seas "
the chicken meal i had was delicious.  the beef soup was ok.  the sliced ham appetizer is a little squishy for my taste.  the shrimp appetizer was good.  nice views out of the window if you sit by them.
the hotel is located in the woods around the city. the beds are good and the rooms clean. only the price is a bit high and the restaurant is expensive.
"food was unpleasant and would not recommend.  english menu was very limited, you are not able to get the specials in english."
"we had planned to eat in rijssen itself, however after a heavy week and then a bracing walk in the surrounding woods we decided, after a quick look at the menu to eat in the hot "
great location and nicely done restaurant. friendly staff. food is a bit ordinary though and therefore too expensive for what it is. a great spot for a coffee or drink without the hefty price tag for the food.
"we called thinking it was open during the day around 5 the lady told us on the phone website is wrong we open at 6.we showed up at 6:50 pm making sure they are open now.we asked to be seated she said :do you have a reservation? i said no sorry we need one ? she never said anything when we called it worth mentioning there were 6 couples sitting at 6 tables in a approximately 20 tables restaurant and more tables outside all empty .she said i am alone it will be a very long wait before i get to you. i was like how long? i don’t know very long!!!.she was very mad so we left hungry,upset and sad. i guess we are not wanted here."
"im unfamiliar with dutch food, so it may have great to natives, but not flavorful to me. i had cod. light,but the accompanying peppers & hollandaise, made it bland. could not eat it. escargot was good. husband had surf & turf. over cooked. atmosphere was alluring. wine recommendation was just perfect. go for drink, possible appetizer. skip full meal."
"we had made reservation, nobody new what to do because it was not administrated. lot of tables available but nobody had the idea to seat us. long wait for a waitress to come to our table. politeness or manners where totally absent. food was ok. waiting for more than 20 minutes to clear the table….. still not done. asked out of frustration (no desert) for the bill. got the request to go get it at the bar upfront . i’ve never had such a bad experience at a restaurant. our expectations where high as we had dined here before pre corona. quality standards where at that time on par. will never come here again."
went here on a fridaynight after shopping for the holida 
"nice restaurant with good food. it want to be an upscale restaurant, but it isnt. the portions are small and the menu is not that great. choose for wonders or the other places nearby"
due to restaurant week rating we had dinner at restaurant. we dont understand the high ranking of the restaurant week because of the average quality of the main course.  nevertheless the service was outstanding and enthusiastic! conclusion: normal dinner with good price quality
"stroming is located at a nice spot in the shopping mall of heerhugowaard. it is a nice restaurant where many locals come to have diner. we had diner with friends and we picked this location because of a past experience. this time we were much less enthusiastic about the food. we sent a diet list way upfront to the restaurant to ask if they could accommodate that diet and of course they could. however, the implementation was awful and full of mistakes. between starter (which had some obvious mistakes) and main course i asked politely if they could pay a bit more attention to the diet of one of the guests. well they didnt. although the servants were friendly it cannot compensate the chefs ignorance. for the other people the food was kind of ok but not exceptional. the portions are rather small."
"quite a good meal, but having spent about 40 euros on 4 food items, a tea and a coffee, we asked for a cup of hot water, they refused. very stingy."
"we liked the menu and found the food of good quality. however, service was very slow even though it was not very busy. staff is friendly but does not seem to realize that they are there to serve customers. we had a nice table by the window and the interior is ok. but i can image if the restaurant is really busy you could probably listen in on the conversations at the table next to you. i would say that our overall experience is good."
"although we had made a reservation the booking wasn’t found. food mediocre, wine expensive, table too small, staff friendly. not worth a second try."
"we were there for a business dinner including partners and children. reservation was for 7pm. no drinks order was taken before 7.30. staff seemed to be totally ignorant of the many eyes and hands trying to get attention so they can bring us menus. we could order starters and main courses aprox 45 min after we had come in and starters took another 45 min to prepare. most of the starters were cold dishes with a few krokets boards. the main dishes didnt come until 9.20, more than an hour after order. at 9.30 the lights got dimmed in preparation of closing while we were still eating. desert card was offered at 9.45 but the attitude was more please dont order we are closing soon. food was ok. if you are in a hurry, this is not a recommended place to go. "
"noor is a relatively new restaurant in bloemendaal. we went to noor to celebrate a business deal with 5 colleagues. at arrival it turned out they had booked us a table for 4 with a bench and tried to have 3 of us sit on 1 side. when we convinced them that we wanted an extra chair or table they admitted that it was because they were fully booked and had no extra chairs. only because a lady in another table was in a wheelchair, we could swap with another table with an extra chai "
very very bad. club breaths quality but is nothing more than a tourist trap. extremely overpriced (even for a beach club) and seriously bad food. super dry bread with tiny chicken pieces and an undercooked egg. old bread with fishsalad straight from the sligro wholesaler. wine ordered by the glass is not poured at the table so could be any brand. very unprofessional.they have no idea what they are doing. young and unschooled waiters and kitchen staff. what a disaster. never again.
awful experience. i know it was sunny and crowded but it is not an excuse for how awful it w 
what a terrible arrogant service. not friendly. it’s at the beach as one of the permanent places. will have enough business due to location but service is terrible. as a local i would say “ignore visiting” and go to neighbor san blas
"came to spent the day at the beach, ordered an cesar salad and it was so sad. service horrible i give a 0 honest "
"i came to this restaurant today with my wife, daughter, her husband and two childr "
"zero points  terrible service, food not worth the money. arrogant, no professional staff, spend your money and don’t bother us attitude.  very sad to see what became of the place."
"we just had a simple caesar salad for lunch, but that was absolutely not worthy of a restaurant of this standard. too much plain iceberg lettuce, too much dressing. nothing culinary and lack of flavor. food during earlier visits at dinner time was ok, but not more than that. a real pity for such establishment. we did enjoy the ambiance of the place and beautiful views. contrary to earlier reviews, the staff was friendly and attentive."
"what a pity for this ambiance restaurant on the beach with a nice view, but never been a restaurant with such a bad service!!! food is okay but all the waiters were not paying attention at all to our table , even we were with 9 people! waiting so long for our food. and when we finished with the food, not even one of the waiters came to clean our table or asked for some desserts/ other drinks. they were just talked to each others. one of us came to them personally asking if somebody can help to take an order for coffee. after that, we had to wait about 20minutes and ask twice for the bill. terrible!!!"
"i visited this restaurant yesterday. waiting for a place lasted about 20 minutes. a place for customers was behind us, but i was ignored! finally found a table for  "
"very tastefully designed interior. the bar is set high compared to the previous pavilion. that too was already distinctive, but this time even very un-dutch. beautiful soft colors with cool details and refined accents. however, service and customer-friendliness are still lacking on many fronts. if you pretend to be a distinctive beach club, do so on hospitality. have someone at the entrance who will tell you how it works, especially in this day and age. let the team wear something that distinguishes itself from your guests and do not let people wait so long that they go and get the card themselves and walk to the bar to pay. then the mission is wrong. it turns out that im not the only one who noticed this. what we ate was fine, but nothing special. im not going to talk about price and quality. at the moment that has flown a bit out of control nationwide. in short, interesting to have seen it. back again next year to see if the level of hospitality has improved. i really hope they pick this up."
"lots of staff, but some need some customer service training. not very welcoming.  steak (frites) served lukewarm."
"nice interior. ok food. still struggling to really create a place with warmth, but that will probably come in time. place could be a bit better suited for children too."
"not even the height of the day, easy going tuesday at noon. started with 2 grumpy waitresses not interested in working or their customers. had to wait for minutes to get a menu, while they were chatting to their colleagues inside. when asking for more service, had to get their attention by waving fiercly for 5 minutes. and then to top it off, prices. i know this is not the cheapest place, so don’t mind that but i do mind paying a lot for nothingness on my plate. cannot believe the fuzz about this place."
"the place has an amazing view across the beach. you find comfortable chairs and beds with cushions. but definitely the service is very bad, almost empty place they tarried in serving us being more than 15 minutes. the food served fast. but it is normal. the food is nothing delicious, the flavors are very basic. they never collected the food dishes. only 3 hours later when we asked for the bill."
"weve been coming here for years but somehow the owner or management has gone astray. what used to be a cool beach place with great food is now an overpriced wannabe beach bar, not much different from others. what a pi "
"one of the classic beachside places in bloemendaal, zandvoort and co. pretentious place and pretentious people, bad service (dude, dont tell me that the pizza has been cooking in the oven for 25 minutes, not going to buy it - just say that you forgot...) and food is mediocre. theres better around there, not much to be honest, but it doesnt take much to be better than this. skip it."
food is passable but over priced for what is a truly average offering. i can cook steak better and the pizza is undercooked. service is terrible as the staff are over worked. i did not like the chef berating staff in front of customers. the noise is unbelievable. the service is slow - snail slow. possibly the best on offer in the area but that doesnt make it good.
"booked a table for 4 adults and 2 children a few hours in advance, apparently the restaurant was so busy that we got a table in front of the door to the kitch "
"my wife and i had dinner there on a sunday evening and it was very busy. the service was okay and friendly, but it could have been a bit faster "
"nice food for all. restaurant with bar & open restaurant is amazing view towards pond. two separate restaurant, both located towards pond. nice whether and cold evening with fire is good experience"
"the tables were well arranged and the service good, but the selection was limited with a strong emphasis on meat and fish and very little choice of vegetables and fresh salads."
no floor manager and it shows. wait staff did what they feel like which unfortunately wasnt taking care of our table. waited an hour for our starter in an almost empty restaurant. we hardly saw our waitress again after that. finally went to the front ourselves to pay while she was still chatting up the only table she was apparently interested in. not recommended even if the food itself was ok.
"the location is great, when we arrived the place was near empty so we thought service would be gre "
the food were yummy as always but had to repeatedly remind for all the items. unexpected rude behaviour by the staff these time around.
"we had a business lunch appointment and checked into this place without much further ado... had some great ham and eggs, with cheese on top -- not bad at all, some coffees and enjoyed the seaview on a windy and bit rainy day. that is all. there are 3 other beach bar/restaurants to choose from, we often prefer club zand to the others. but zeezicht is an average place. no surprises..."
"attracted by the nice location we had diner. the idea, as the waiter explained, is kind of a table dhote concept with changing menus every week. the food was ok, unfortunately the service quit poor. loads of dirty glasses and dishes remained on table, water was hard to find and orders were mixed up ( there were only 4 tables to be served "
"a lovely location and a great building - an old youth hostel - has a good menu. however, the experience was tarnished by poor service; delays and wrong orders."
what a disappointment with the very low services at an exorbitant pri 
what a disappointment and left after one drink! rosé disgusting and warm. choice of snacks poor. corona rules not followed (didn’t have to fill in our details) they didn’t clean tables. bah!! only redeeming feature was fast service and politeness
"it is a nice location. we had lunch. the meal was ok, but nothing special for that price.  we were a little hungry after lunch. so it was not really a big meal."
"returned for a nice evening meal. theres enough staff, but theyre  not very quick with service. the quality of the dished was unfortunately below expectations. no longer worth to make the trip."
here the most special feature is to sit with your feet in the sand and face the sea and it’s sunset! amazing! the food is okay the drinks choice too. the setting is why you go here 😉
"very few fish options, so i went for the fish soup. a very small bowl filled up with more onions that seafood. it was clearly not a fish soup but some kind of creamy sauce, with a pack of frozen seafood thrown jn there. no good. my husband had the uitsmater, 3 running eggs on top of ham and cheese. no salad, no green, plain and frankly too simple. i understand you probably dont go there for their fine dining, but they still serve food and charge good money for it...the least is to give decent food. the rest of the card is fried stuffs and burgers...service is done by young kids "
"great location, a nice space for kids to play, friendly service, but food quality a bit of a disappointment."
have been here before but was a bit disappointed by the quality of the food this time. we had a fish burger which tasted a bit fishy and the saté meat was very d 
they advertise fresh farm fries. these are great and a real reason to come back as a regular. when its sunny thus busy they revert back to greasy factory fries which are not even cri 
location is nice and staff was committed. food was then also looking good but the taste was rather disappointing as there wasnt much.
"when having lunch here on a hot summer day, we had a lovely time. the outside seating area was cramped but alive, service was quick but nice and food was as expect "
"whenever visiting relatives in holland i tend to stroll the beaches in bakkum, favorite restaurant is zoomers because of their laid back atmosphere which is the most trendy of the restaurants on the beach in my eyes, food is adequate yet not spectacular. prices o.k. and the portions are good. fish we at was overcooked, wine good, service is o.k. otherwise. dont expect gourmet food but the whole experience is adequate for the money spent."
we are very disappointed with the service. the chinese lady taking orders by the counter was rude & unfriendly. we do not understand why her attitude was very unwelcoming & she obviously looked annoyed when we wanted to make a reservation. it made us feel very unwelcome.
"no direct critique on my last visit to jasmin garden, but more in general. has the quality of chinese/indonesian food gone down significantly over the last decade or so? its been a while since ive ordered an indonesian/chinese rijsttafel. in this particular instance one for 4 people. i felt bad for my relatives who payed for it. it was like walking down a supermarket aisle. price the same, but less in the package or, in our case less dishes on the tabl "
chose this place because of the good reviews and because we are still expecting to eat chinese in a chinese restaurant somewhere in holland that is not chinatown (stupid expectation). we had no reservation and asked for a table for 2 and after a short wait we were taken to our tabl 
"for me it was the second time having dinner at this restaurant. what a difference with my first visit. it was known to the restaurant that we were there (7 guests) to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. not one word was mentioned. the staff was clumsy with the wine and with serving after dinner tea. the owner/host never came to our table to ask if everything was okay. (this has been mentioned before in the lekker 500 magazine). the food was as it should be, but service and hospitality was disappointing."
"we have not been at apicius for a couple of years; a recent action draw our intention. however our renewed experience was not a favorable one: the hostess was quite clumsy (on our request if we could park a car nearby without being fined she answered: actually i dont know but you will find out sooner or later), the (excellent) white wine, was presented at room temperature instead of cooled, when we asked for some adjustments in the menu, this was received in a way that made us feel uncomfortable, without subsequent communication; the menu was fair, but not excellent or even creative; the beans tasted as if they came from the freezer instead of fre "
"the menu sounded very good but we found the food had no wow factor you expect from a restaurant with michelin stars. the atmosphere was poor, too many tables too close. i had a flower display taking up half my table placing that was imitation. not something i expect with fine dining. the whole restaurant needs updating, its cold with no atmosphe "
"only went once, but it was over-rated as far as we were concerned.  food was ok, service ok, but nothing special."
"based on reviews and hearsay we decided to give this trattoria a try. i must say we had a very pleasant evening. the ambiance and the service is more then ok a very friendly and helpfull staff. as for the food i have some remarks. yes everything tasted fine (not spectacular), portion sizes where ok, but in comparison with the prices asked it did not fit the picture completely. when getting a vitello tonato for € 13,50 i expect more, same goes for the grilled fish platter for € 26,50 a person. as said, we did have a nice evening, but at this price level i expect to be more surprised whit what is coming out of the kitchen. will i go back, i think yes, i would like to give it another try with different dishes, hopefully that can change my mind."
innesto has a nice a outside setting making it a good summer choice. i was not hugely impressed with the actual food however the menu is attractive and the service is good.
this is a very large buffet restaurant just off the centre of asten. it is on two levels as it has a mezzanine floor overlooking the main food counters. wouldnt recommend walking up and down stairs to get your food. stick to the ground floor. the selection is pretty much what you would expect of one of these places with a pretty good choice. the wine/beer/soft drinks are all included in the price of 26.50 e pp for a saturday night. there were a lot of children running around so obviously dutch parents dont have much control. there is a 2 hour time limit but if you cant have a meal in 2 hours something is wrong. no service as such its all self service.
"if the chef’s wife is the hostess i would divorce her. he has a goldmine in his hand without het . food is gold, service with her is lead."
"last year, i visited this restaurant that had just opened and was surprised by the different tastes and menu offerings of this asian fusion restaurant. this year’s visit was a bit of a disappointment. this restaurant has lost touch and steam in taste and quality of dishes. different beef dishes all suffer from the dame salty soy sauce taste, almost like with help if industrial taste improvers like dressing and sauces you can bit in the supermarkt. the dragon sushis’s rice was too loosely rollend and fell apart while picking it up, suffering from a pile of potatoe straw that took away all taste of the sushi’s fillings. no lemon grass taste in the lemon grass skewers, only soy sauce taste. it seemed if the restaurant had changed the ingredients: thicker rice rolls on the sushi and fewer fine ingredients. no innovation in the menu at all since a year ago, takes away the surprise. flat tastes in general, while the asian fusion concept has all the opportunities to offer more variety in tastes: more spicy offerings, more lemon tastes, less dominance of standard salty soy sauce tastes. strong used cooking oil odour inside the whole restaurant dominating the place, makes you wonder if they change the oil often enough and spare you the cancerous effects of overused cooking oil. so the dishes and tastes have become less distinguished and different, smaller and fewer high end ingredients, flat tastes in general. staff a bit stressed because of the e or ours amount of delivery orders. we felt that guests in the restaurants now need to wait more and suffer from flatter tastes and one size fits all foods because of the uptake of the deliveries. should not be this way. last year i wrote it was worthwhile to drive extra miles to experience this restaurant, but the brilliance has gone and kaizen is now more of a standard stand village restaurant, it is becoming just an other chinese with slightly different dishes in a sharing bites concept. it has downgraded itself. very good coffee, nice staff. it is obvious that the villagers go for delivery orders and that that the physical restaurant probably cannot compete with delivery meals where people accept less sophisticated tastes. it would be good if the physical restaurant offered something extra and not only a table for the same food."
"we planned breakfast at this van der valk based on other experiences at other van der valk restaurants. warm food offering was limited, no bacon, some dried out sausages, eggs served on a cold saucer. the buffet area was cramped and crowded. the salmon very salty. there was fresh orange juice and a selection of bread and cheese/meat. @ 19,50 euro per person our expectations were at a different level."
"went here for an evening meal, while staying in the area. poor service, very average food and no ambiance whatsoever. possibly to cater for the clientele of the casino on the premises. disappointing!!"
"het lieve leven serves rather good food, but the ambiance is very, very chilly. it starts already with the table reservation: the girl answering the phone is not really interested, just answers ok. decoration is rather basic: dark floor, no curtains, overlooking the highway. it all feels very chilly. fortunately i had a bussiness dinner, but as a couple i would never go there; a refrigareator has more atmosphe "
"we went to jatapasu for my 40th birthday meal with my small family. the initial host to seat us was very friendly. the concept is a you can eat, no limits to rounds or amount "
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"stayed at the hotel for several days. the food was delicious and presented very elegantly with nice choices on both the a la carte and on the 3-5 course chef options. however, the service speed was painfully slow and wait staff seemed inexperienced and leaderless. restaurant was not busy with lots of empty tables but still was very slow taking orders and dinner took 3 hours+."
"dinner in a chateau. who doesnt want that experience. we had dinner at this hotel/restaurant. we choose the chef menu but decided to have three courses. after the amuse, which was nice, we had the sashimi of tuna. nice but a little overwhelming with different tastes. after the sashimi we had the trio of beef. a carpaccio, a filet americain and a tartare. very nice but the sizes were big. after the second course we had the livar (pork) and the cod. the cod was slicly overcooked and the livar dry. having higher expectations in advance voor the level if the restaurant, we were slightly disappointed. the service was very friendly and always willing to explain the course or the wi "
"we came as a business group (guests of the hotel château holtmühle) for a dinner after a long and exhausting day, rather hungry. the restaurant was somewhat busy, but it does not explain extremely slow service. it took us something around three hours to get food served. the food itself was nice, yet the whole joy was spoiled by the pace it was served. one doesnt expect two minutes of eating (degustation menu du chef - five small courses) and half an hour waiting for the next course. absolutely unacceptable. we regretted we did not dine at macdonalds that night."
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
the friendly service apparently cant handle the crowds. far too long waiting times. our (reserved) high tea therefore became a travesty. what a pity.
"it was a nice spring day, temperature was warm. we were sitting outside on the terrace. the restaurand sits in this beautiful countryside along a quiet road. no builings in sight , except the old mill and the restaurant itself. peace and quiet and a nice meal. what more can you possibly wa "
"first time was oke, 2nd time is was poor. food was not good."
"we visited restaurant lindeboom on a busy saturday evening. we were placed in the corner at the end of the restaurant. this proved during the evening to be rather unfortunate, as it became very hot and the acoustics were terribl "
"i visited de lindeboom for dinner, since their reputation is quite good in the region. the restaurant is somewhat pretentious, but it did not fully meet my expectations. the courses were quite original, but the flavors were sometimes a bit bland. that said, it is a comfortable, luxurious place with friendly, attentive staff. given the quality of the food, slightly over-priced."
"the restaurant is on its way towards a michelin star, although that is said when i read the press. the food i find to simple in the sense of surprise or excellent taste. they have a superior wine card they say but when serving the wine at the dishes i had to ask even what they are serving. we were with a big group that could be an excuse."
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"definitely a place to avoid. food is expensive and of average quality. service is mediocre and staff, especially the owners, are arrogant. when we visited, the sewer system left a distinctive smell but the staff wasn’t bothered to reac "
"people make mistakes....such as bringing my main course before you bring me the starter i ordered? it went down hill from there. when we finally received our main courses, my husbands was piping hot; mine however was luke warm at best. i should have complained at that point. however, i was tired, it was late and it had been a long da "
"after visiting multiple italian restaurants in the neighbourhood i can state that this place is a pizzeria and not a restaurant. pizzas were ok, nothing special and the wine was average. furthermore, the place lacked atmosphe "
"the pizza on your plate is very good, tasty, crisp bottom, but the surroundings do not improve the experience. the sound of people talking buzzes around in the area. if there are groups/tables with a larger number of clients that order at the same time, the kitchen can not cope with it. the waitresses could have a better feeling if you need e.g. a new drink by walking around in stead of grouping near the counter."
"food was over cooked, waitress was rude, dirty glasses and the list goes on. must be the worst restaurant i have been too"
"visited the greek restaurant santorini this evening. i wrote this review immediately when i came back home because i was really disappointed. it was the second time i came there (the first time was ok), this was terrible. the food was not bad although we had to wait for it a long time (more than 20 min.) but the service was really bad. we had to speak up to the waitress before she came to our table so we could tell her our coffee was watery and cold. she gave us a look as if we personally insulted her. the second coffee was still watery but hot (microwave?). i give the food a 7, service a 3."
we didnt stay a night at this romantic white castle but we did took a walk in the castle area. there is a walking route map in front of the castle by the parking area. its a beautiful castle to see.
"this could be such a lovely place to go to, but the staff just ruin everything. your drinks take ages to arrive simply rude in asking what your roomnumber is during breakfast. and the rooms are very basic. its good to sleep and the fact i have nt rated it poor is because its located in a beautiful surrounding (especially in the morning with the fog) "
"we stayed two nights in the hotel. the restaurant is convenient as there is nothing nearby unles you take your car. there is al limited choice and the menu is all right fot once but not for a second time as the choice is too limited. when busy the meat can be too far gone, juicy becomes more than medium."
"food is ok, nothing special. service personell is friendly. this is more like a fastfood restaurant. we tried the gyros dish, it was ok, but could probably need some more spices."
"if youre into far fetched cuisine and have very little appetite, and you dont mind paying exorbitant prices for your modest wine, this restaurant will surely please you. others, looking for real food with real taste, go elsewhere....."
repeat visit. opted for the promising von clermont menu which we have very much enjoyed in the pas 
"stayed in this hotel restaurant for one night. went to the bar-bistro first for a drink and appetisers. the glass of beer was almost more foam than beer. an unacceptable head. the waitress did apologise after complaining and topped up the glass. the bitter ballen were small, industrial, half empty and the mustard came out of a cheap paper sachet. and all this in a 5 star establishment. very bad inde "
"my appetizer just tasted like fridge (beef tartare), really disgusting, my husband did like his appetizer. head course was better but not good, meat was well cooked. dissapointing..."
"we stayed at kasteel vaalsbroek and booked a dinner arrangement with accommodation. we were sat in the cosy area of in de watermolen. winelist was good, but we had the feeling they rushed the service a bit. we had to ask to slow done with bringing the courses as we had the feeling they were rushing  "
"the restaurant is elegant, prices are quite high but the food is really bad and leaves teh impression fo low quality ingredients."
food is good authentic dishes at moderate pric 
i had a decent italian meal..fro. the portion to the taste it was pure italian. the service was quick and friendly. good view in the calm vaals..and they do home delivery
"we stayed for 1 night in hotel bilderberg. their restaurant was full so we had to look for something else. we went to della mamma. nice cousy italian restaurant. the staff is very friendly. we ordered carpaccio and pasta. all was good. if you look more for a fancy italian then this is not the place, but for pizza, pasta nice cousy place it is."
"not a bad pizza for dutch standards, but clearly no wood fired stone oven stuff. tiramisu was quick good. nice garden seating at the back. service was ok."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
even though this is an established place its still open to improvement. they are lucky with an excellent manager who understands the guests and is willing to listen. will give a write up after a next visit to see what has changed for the better.
we were disappointed they were closed the day we were in town. located on a newly redone plaza and probably a lovely spot if they were open.
"i am handicapped and asked for a table were i am more or less protected. but this they did not have, it was busy, understandable. on my question: ‘ if you make reservation is it than possible to have a table out of the busy part of the restaurant. the answer was no, we have no attention for this, it is better if you go to a less busy restaurant. i was flabbergasted, but thought oké. good food here, but if handicapped you are not welcome here. we went to the village of vijlen where we ate in cuba libre, which was a good experience. "
"the food was terrible, heaten up in a microwave. i never have eaten such a tastless mousaka in my life. watery and the calamaris was rubbery. cheap squidrings would be better then this. only the dry white wine was good. it was packed and bums on seats policy. never go again to this  greek restaurant."
"great greek food, but very noisy and crowded with little children running and screaming. cant eat your dish calmly"
i was looking forward to a nice date evening with my husband but i didnt like the restauran 
we had our family dinner with our parents and the food was goo 
i had diner with a large group here which might not have helped the quality of the food. it was certainly okay but the i guess it is better when you eat here a la carte
"restaurant in a castle/hotel. pretty setting, but average food. ordered avocado/lobster starter, but could not find the avocado. the rack of lamb is the full rack and a little gamey, we are use to australian lamb. never got around to dessert, since we had to leave after 2 1/2 hours to another appointment."
"i booked a table since i understood it was a restaurant gastronomique. unfortunately it is not. the food is not bad, but just average. as the mise-en-bouche we got a piece of bread with a fish mousse, nothing more. the starter and the main course were ok but we expected much more. the price, however, is too expensive for what we got. "
"a big restaurant, normal food, a bit pretentious - you can eat well, but i wil not give it a michelin star."
based upon reviews we were looking forward to eating dinner here. we found via thefork website that if we reserved a table and opted for the three course dinner we could have a 50% discount which made this choice even more attractive. we arrived at 1800h 
"i had dinner here with a friend. the arrival is not very welcoming, you enter the restaurant, not being welcomed, hang your coat somewhere and are not approached in the restaurant with some kindness. i had to change two times for a table, where i could hear my friend, because of the, too, loud music in the dining area. the food is okay and tasty, but not very creati "
"we reserved for 19.30 and when we arrived there was no free table and were directly pointed to an area where we could have a drink. no explanation, just like that. around 20.00 we then got our table. the dinner was good. starter was excellent, main course and desert where average. personnel was friendly."
i went in specially a few hours earlier to choose a table and reserve it only to find it occupied by someone else when we turned up. when i complained the different waiter knew nothing about my reservation. on another occasion they served me flat prosecco and were slightly put out in opening a new bottle. concerning the food quality - it fluctuates - sometimes it is very good and at other times not. de pedestal is best to come in and have a drink by the cosy fireplace and then decide on the moment. 
first for the decor - the fireplace was lovely! the tables were nicely spaced although i would have loved to see tablecloths - that would have made it more class 
"food is average or even below average. way too crowded, so nobody could keep an appropriate distance. overall very disappointing."
"we were with four for dinner at lust, which is nicely situated at a square, but offered rather mediocre food and had really bad acoustics... no complaints about the service nevertheless!"
"food was average quality for a grandcafe. service was slow, and appears to be preoccupied. spareribs were cold. won’t be returning here soon."
"we came to celbrate y mothers 85th birthday on a saturday evening with a group of eleven familymembers. we were welcomed in a proper way, the restaurant is a cozy, though rather big room with many tables, also for larger groups and the service to order was rather adequat "
"nijkerk is a city close to amersfoort and has a number of restaurants situated in the centre.this restaurant is a 10 minutes walk from there, has a large terrace on the corn "
"compared to its fame in the area, the prices are moderate and the food is good to excelle "
what was supposed to be a nice dinner turned into something hilariou 
what a weird experience we had 
was pretty okay for a classic all you can eat sushi. didnt really maintain consistent quality and the price was relatively high. but overall decent quality and atmosphere
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didn’t seem to care. won’t be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
we stayed for a few nights only a 5min drive away. there are a bunch of restaurants around this area. some even offer similar food and concepts like this o 
"food was ok but not thai, wines were great but staff had no idea about the wines, i was actually told that the viognier was a dessert wine????"
very average and extremely overpriced asian food. the warm food was served almost cold and meat quality and cooking techniques for high end asian food (which is what this place is trying to be) where very poor. paying a high price for poor quality food never feels oka 
"great ambiance, nice restaurant, food is good, good wines by the glass! point of improvement: staff is very friendly but need to become more efficient, waiting for a aperitif for 20 minutes and after the starter waiting for 35 minutes for the main course seems a bit too long, anyway will return in a couple of months!"
"the waiter came to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. when i said i would like to see the menu he grumpily said that lunch only would be served after 12:00. so we can only order a drink. i prefer to match my drink with my food, but he could not offer us the lunch menu at 11:56. we would have been happy to wait, but no menu, so we ordered coffee, paid and left."
"on one of our many cycle trips through the veluwe we came accros de zwarte boer, the zwarte boer is a high quality restaurant offering morning coffee , lunch , high teas and evening dinners. the staff are friendly , the quality of the food is excellent"
"made a visit here yesterday for lunch. approx. 6 people sitting on the terrace outside with a waitress taking care of these tables, approx. 6 people sitting in the restaurant inside with a waiter taking care of inside tables .... not very busy so you would expect a decent service. took over 10 minutes to be acknowledged and an order to be taken. when food did arrive, what is classified as bread on the menu (tunnbrod), is in actual fact just a cracker. would have loved a second glass of wine but no staff around to ask. very dissapointed overall. waitress asked when we were leaving if everything had been ok but typical dutch service, when i said no it wasnt ok, she just shrugged her shoulders and handed me the receipt for the food. what a horrible place."
"a nicely renovated old farmhouse in a rural setting, offering dining in its restaurant and in the brasserie. after dinner in the brasserie, we regretfully had to conclude that the situation had not improved since earlier visits, i.e. rather casual service and average meals."
"nice location, outdoor seating, rural atmosphere. staff not friendly. takes long time to being served. ( several occasions)?no apolgy for mistakes, like forgetting order, not willing to take order for snacks at 11.45, because they didnt serve snacks before12.00.cold coffee. rating could easily be so much better if staff would be friendlier, more hospitable ."
"this is a sad story about a hotel in a wonderful environment. the hotel features a 1st class attitude and aspiration but is actually not very good. accommodation is ok provide that you dont want international news, coffee in you room etc. the restaurant has great staff (until about 21.30) but the menu is about as extensive as mcdonalds and the wine? .. not good.once upon a time this place had high hopes and standards; now im really happy not to stay any longer."
this was a good restaurant in a nice location. the staff were friendly and service was fast however the menu was a bit limited. the food that was on there did taste quite nice though but it was reasonably expensive.
"nice location with a great terrace. food is ok, not special. service is depending on personell. good/average"
"this restaurant is located nicely in the forest of veluwe, a very popular destination on a sunny summer day. it has an outdoor place t "
not good sushi. expensive way to eat and drinks are expensive. far too expensive for the quality. wont be visiting again.
"food was of decent quality, enough  quantity and not expensive.  personnel was pretty fast and kind. decoration was nice too."
"the food is good, however not very special. service is also good. it can be a littly noisy, due to the accoustic, so be aware where your gonna sit."
waiting time too long. starter was just a sort of beetroot ‘coulis’. not as exciting as it sounded on the menu. main course of fish ..the fish was too soft and cold and probably defrosted. chips excellent. expensive meal . pleasant service but food quality unimpressive. 
hmmmmm i just dont understand it when we order a mixed grill without chicken and instead of the chicken some pork a huge piece of chicken filet is on the pla 
"great people working here and very friendly. however, the food was mixed. all the side dishes are great and excellent quality. but the main dishes we had mixed feelings, one person ordered fish which was 1/3 the size of the chicked dish and barely enough for a child. the greek chicked wasnt that great, the meat dishes were tho. mixed feeling over the food but great people here and great side dishes."
"we ordered 4 mixed grills, but the meat was pretty dry. especially the spare ribs tasted like old shoe "
"lovely setting by the water, however disappointing food and staff. busy place, did not feel welcome and taken care of."
"we visited this place twice. the food is pleasant and biological. the menu a nice improvement above the usual “fries” restaurants. the service is friendly but a mess. the forgot one main dish and when they found out it was sold out, came twice with food for other tables and missed ours with our food. better management will help a lot. the terrace is nice but noisy next to a busy road."
"for starters i had the cheese plate and for main course the hamburger. the cheese plate only contained 8 small blocks of supermarked quality cheese. the hamburger looked tastefull, but was not very tastefull. service is slow. location is nice. not recommended."
only pavilion on a beautiful beach.  adventurous menu and great service.  we thoroughly enjoyed a long lunch.  unfortunately most of us ended up with stomach trouble later in the day.  so pls check your kitchen.
visited this restaurant today and decided to try something different: pad thai. quite a disappointment and does not even resemble the original thai recipe. ambiance and services are good though
"with rather snooty waiters, who ask questions but dont absorb the answers, i unfortunately got served food i am allergic to. fortunately i caught it in time. the response of the waiter was underwhelming."
"both the venue and menu look fancy, but food and service didnt live up to those expectations. service was clumsy and confused at times and some of the dishes (duck liver & tagiatelle) were too salty. banofee desert was delicious though."
"went here for lunch with our two children (age 5). although the restaurant advertised that they had a menu for the younger guests, that was far from it....unless they meant age 12 and up. overpriced for what you get. the waiters attitude was less than stellar. the only great thing is their nobeltje. not a place to return to....sadly."
it looked good from the street but the fish soup was a couple of prawns in a broth and the mussels were distinctly average with a few acidic vegetables as the broth. please do not order red wine; it wad the most vile i have ever tasted and many of my friends would say that is several barrels. this is a place for complacent tourists.
"now, from a restaurant located in a marina you’d expect that they are used to handling large groups from, say, some incoming leaders yachts. but when we moored, and visited the terrace with a group of 50 persons, the staff freaked ou "

"disappointing, very small portions (seabass was two pieces of 3 by 3 cm only), expensive and quite fat (3 spoons of mayonaise on the frisian carpaccio). we expected more from what is stated to be a michelin bistro."
"this is landgoed lauswolts house bistro which is situated round the back of the hotel and reached by a trek alongside the kitchen and its associated service area. not knowing quite what to expect, we turned a corner to find that the place was absolutely rammed with just our reserved table remaining. we were handed a large menu, in dutch (fair enough,) and left to get on with i "
"we had a superb diner at this place two years ago, which was the reason to stop here for a second time. we found out that the place has new owners and also the kitchen changed .... unfortunately. it is an easy small menu, nothing special and the food was just ok. it took for ever until we where served and for us not a place we would come back.

"food average, dead silence, poor atmosphere. not recommendable. and for the quality of both the food and the surroundings, it was definitely overpriced."
"the terrace outside this hotel is very nice on a sunny warm day, so we ordered a simple lunch of cheese toasties. unfortunately it took a long time to come and when it did the meal was cold with the melted cheese congealed and unpleasant."
this is the second visit we have made to this stunning location. arriving by boat we are made to feel welcome and were offered a reservation for din 
"nice outdoor dining by the motor yachts. food was good, not great. service was good despite our language barrier."
"we are a group of friends on a boat and wanted to have a good dinner out . the food was good but the service absolutely lousy . not friendly at all , no smiles .. just a very grumpy attitude ."
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
"perhaps the best asian/chinese restaurant in emmelord but as is usual the menue and preparations are adapted to local tastes. this time we had take away and while filling and with good ingredients it lacked any special surprises. still, if we wanted chinese again wed choose here. located beneath the le mirage restaurant which i rate as the best restaurant in emmelord. "
"when we arrived we were greeted nicely and were sat right away. once we place our order thats when it went down hill. it took over an hour and 15 min to get our food. the food was ok, i had better from a fast food place. i live in germany so i am used to dinner taking awhile but this was horrible. will never go back and would not recommend this to anyone."
i’m at the bar waiting for a beer for 30 mins lol.  please serve us .  all we want is a drink.  is that too hard to ask?
"been to a few vd valk restaurant recently and this one really dissapointed. poor service, tasteless tournedos and too slow."
"the restaurant at the van der valk hotel was very strange. the chefs certain put some effort into the dishes, but managed to ignore the less is more mantra and put far too many ingredients together. the starter, calves cheek, was pleasant although slightly overcooked. but quite what a chunk of undercooked red pepper was doing in the mash was anyones guess. similarly the sole: nicely cooked fish, decent chips. but with added potato and fish fingers? (i thought at one point they had given me an additional childs menu by mistake!) similarly dessert: decent panna cotta, topped by far too bitter passion fruit jell "
"this is your typical van der valk restaurant: large amounts of food, not very refined but good quality.  dont expect anything special, this is why many people choose van der valk as their favorite restaurant.  prices are ok, service good."
not a very remarkable hotel. cheap. clean. dutch. our room was very far from the front desk / breakfast area. not great if you have mobility issues. nice place to leave your bags and go do something else for the day.
"luckily van der valk hotel is currently being renovated. hopefully the restaurant is next. the chairs are very bad and for the old people coming to the restaurant to have a nice diner, the chairs are a menac "
"good food, big choice, also ok for veggies, good beers and wines, reasonable prices, flexible people, but do not expect a star menu as in expensive restaurants."
"this mansion was advertised as a pleasant and welcoming lunchtime stop during a countryside hike. unfortunately we were rather dismissively told that we could not be served anything, not even a coffee, due to lack of staff (dispite visible evidence to the contrary). hikers are obviously not regarded as welcome guests. avoid."
"the food we had was enjoyable, but i am not sure anyone could cope with the volume of food on offer and whilst it sounds attractive, the food is very filling and we only got through two of five available rounds of choices and felt a little expensive in the circumstances. downside, there was no english translation of the menu (there were small pictures) and it was only with the benefit of a kind local patron that we understood how the menu worked. "
"we usually go to sumo in haarlem for sushi, but we ate at mikaku a few times. the location is fine (enough parking) and the staff is friendly. the food is ok, fresh and the selection is good. but if you expect great sushi, i suggest you go to sumo in stead. not to sound negative, but somehow the sushi is not that yummy."
"we stayed for a night in one of the larger rooms @ € 130. yes, the room is larger (5x5m), but the bathroom is tiny (1,5x1,5m) with a defunctioning light above the washbasin. tapestry in the room may have a shampooi "
"since it was a week of a school holiday, lots of hotels were fully booked. therefor, i had to find a hotel in the region and found this hotel on the internet. i have booked two nights, but i left after one. for business, this is not the right hotel: very poor or no internet connection, since you are in the middel of nowhere. also, no mobile connection! the employees of the hotel were nevertheless very helpful by installing a television in my room since there wasnt one (since i could not work, i liked to watch a champions league soccer match) . diner and breakfast were good. all and all, i think this a nice hotel if you are looking for peace and quiet with your partner, but not for business!"
nice but far from spectacular. have eaten in a lot of michelin star restaurants all over the world or “mentioned” restaurants from the guide so maybe my expectations got in the way. i wasn’t surprised by anything served. service was great wine paring as should be but overall the experience was below even one star. (personal opinion) desert as per picture an overkill. it didn’t leave you with the pleasant feeling as it should have been. i will not be back.
"very good, professional and friendly service. the dishes are beautifully presented and show a lot of technical skills. so many different dishes with every course, many excellent on their own but no balance in overall dish. most times in great kitchens less is more. wine list which is overall poor and many selections overpriced. for me not a two star."
"we entered with high expectations, but were quickly disappointed. the interior is kinda blunt and closed, acoustics allowing you to hear every word of what is said at the next table. the service was a little cool, and even though prices are very reasonable, wed like to know what we will have to pay in advance - neither the drinks, the lunch menu or the coffee were priced beforehand. food was good, but quite salty and not all food combinations worked out well - my taste buds wrangled a long time with the different flavours they were exposed to. done quite a few michelin star rated restaurants lately, but there seems to be some discrepancy here."
"the food at this place is pretty good indeed. something to be expected obviously, when going to a star restaurant. especially the fish specialities (fruit de mare) and the vegetarian hotdog were super! it is a real fishy place and it does incorporate the local specialties really good. nevertheless, compared to other restaurant in this class, i was a little bit disappointed. i had to ask for my wine, the vegetarian options were often a bit somber in comparison to the real dish and it was not really clear when the menu finished, since we were not asked for coffee or tea. not sure what happened and i do expect something different from a high-range restaurant. nevertheless, we did totally enjoy the evening from 7 to 12! in that sense it was totally worth the money."
"this really was a waste of money! we like good food, go out to restaurants at least once a week and dont mind to pay more when it is worth it. our first experience was on the apartment, see the review under hotel. this was equally if not more disappointing. then the meal: to poor a very spicy sauce over good oysters doesnt make them better but that can be my taste. then the most annoying thing was the amount of alcohol they pored as part of the wine arrangement. i presumed that the amount would be so that you can empty all the glasses in line with the diner. especially at a star restaurant they should think about this. but if you have a starter, 7 dishes, and a dessert, and at all of those you expect your guests to drink a very full glass of wine, i dont think you know your business. this means 2 bottles per person! and if you dared not to finish your glass they left it at the table. so at the end of our meal with 4 people the whole table was full of half empty glasses. and although i can stand some alcohol i am not sure what the dessert was anymore. for me this means you dont know what you are doing and dont care about your guests. after complaining afterwards by email they also didnt care at all which made it even worse."
"we headed over to de kromme watergang for lunch, taking advantage of the restaurantweek menu on offer. basic menu price came to € 42.50 per person, which is of course a steal for a 2* place. additional courses were charged at € 24 per course, which is in line with what youd expect at a 2*. so far, so go "
"de kromme watergang is close to the top of the dutch culinary olympus, hence the hope and expectations of our group-of-five on an unforgettable eating experience were high. well, the bill ran well over 600 euro for a 5 person lunch, so at least that part was in line with the expectations, but alas that was about it. food is excellent of course, but that is, at 2 star level, not enough. two dishes with cod and flounder were too small and not very special in taste nor texture. the combination of pork and eal was surprizing, but again very small. the wine tasting arrangement was also served in un- generous volumes and the wine choises were rather middle of the road. i guess it must be the adria tricks with mousses and foams that have lifted this restaurant to 2 star level, but as customers start to see through this, a re-evaluation and return to real value for money, is imminent and restaurants like this one will have to adapt or die. all in all the kromme watergang provides a formal, but not very warm and generous welcome. we wont return."
"food is excellent, not cheap but very nice. staff was either busy with themselves or inexperienced. will not go back because of poor service."
"we wanted japanese food. the atmosphere was great, the food excellent, the service very nice, but it was a bit expensive."
"we visited with a group of colleagues for our delayed xmas dinner. the restaurant has a nice setting for this, but unfortunately we were spread over 2 tables which broke the team spirit a bi "
"this place got a lot of press coverage, because of the celebrity clientele who happen to live nearby. valet parking and lounge atmosphere are cool, but the food quality is nowhere near what i expected, especially for the price."
"this restaurant has a lovely location and to sit outside would be very pleasant on a sunny day. the interior is very interesting but can be noisy. food was fine without being special, but the service (by, i presume, the manager) was unfriendly, bordering on rude."

"nice place and good food, expecially lamb. the atmosphere was ok, really unformal guests. we had problems in choosing what to eat: no english menu is available. i really didn’t expect that in a place mentioned on michelin guide. even if not so many tourists are used to eat here, at least one menù in english would be compulsory in 2021. we ordered almost blind. better to solve this problem, it’s so simple and it would show attention to all clients!"
"a far over the top restaurant, expensive with no compensating added value. the visitors seem to know each other very well, most of them are so called well-to-do: lots of money and no manners, the new rich. extremely irritant too loud, too posh "
"- friendly, correct waite "
"heard good things about this restaurant. had lunch here before, this time we went for dinner. i had a lovely pheasant but my partner had hare stew which was entirely too sweet. what a shame. the service was ok, waitress was a bit arrogant, too ad really."
"dutch service is notorious for its absence, so expectations usually are not high, however if you are in the center of dutch high-society and this restaurant is a best one, you really expect something. service was really not overly friendly, but efficient. however dirty plates were staying on the table way longer than it would be acceptable in other countries. moreover, the waiter was preparing the next table and dropped the knife on the ground - and then just put it back on the table - unbelievab "
"good food but lousy service. they couldnt cope with a full terrace, not very friendly, took much too long and unprofessional. what a pitty for such a beautiful place and quite a good cook."
"came here for lunch: reception was ok, although a bit haughty and rushed. food was good (i had the risotto) and the service was friendly enough, if not overly warm. great for people watching too: a strange mix of rich older folk, businessmen, and gold diggers."
beautiful location free spacy parking and renovated restaurant. but receipt by staff although friendly was hasty and quite unpersonal. we missed advices about menu and wines so the start was disappointing expecting top service. the two course diner however was good although traditional with wild pate and well cooked deer fillet. we enjoyed the deep dark and sicy wine but high priced. so all in all staff needs to enlarge client attention.
dropped in after a walk. it is a perfect location for families walking on the tafelberg. service is friendly. ordered zuurkool soep. it was a disappointment. the bits of potato were not really cooked and rather hard. the soep missed the bacon snippets. a pity! it is not the firdt time we were disappointed with the food.
"the setting under the trees on a pond is very beautiful. the service is nice but the food was not what we expected. a big part of the menu consists small portions for lunch they advice 2 and for dinner 3, but although on the menu they look nice the result was under average food and therefore i would not advice them. hopefully the salads and full dishes are better, because again the location and setting is very beautiful"
"great location, food is very good dont expect huge portions the service leaves a lot to be desired.....grumpy old men comes to mind. in spite of the very average service we love the decor and having somewhere nice to go eat on our  doorstep."
"service was absolutley disgusting,from the time we arrived,if it had bean just myself and my husband i would have left,but a friend had invited us."

"although the location is really nice, romantic and pretty, the value for money is very poor. the food quality standard is not consistent. my brother and sister in law both got food poisoning here unfortunately. aioli and mayonnaise are not fresh. it really is a shame because the location deserves a top notch restaurant. "
food was decent the rest was more then terrible… service was the worst i ever had… menagment have big mouth so are the people working here… not recommend..
worst restaurant ever! we ordered a few dishes and then a different family arrived. after a hour they got there food and we still didn’t get any. i don’t recommend this place.
"the weather on this februari afternoon was inviting for a nice walk along the beach. after this walk we settled down in the outdoor seating area of strandrestaurant ff tijd. as the sun was shining, we had a nice sit down, albeit with our coats on, with a nice view of the beach an a calm sea. nothing could go wrong for a three point rating now, despite the prices of the simple drinks and food through the roof, the funny taste of the latte macchiato and the staff who clearly didnt enjoy their job.

we ordered a simple “broodplank” and waited close to 30 min! ridiculous. the only plus is the proximity to the beach

"the food was bland, even worse was the service.  the owner walked as if he had just lost his loved ones"
the owner of the company doesnt alow people te order food because of religion reasons. people needed to leave the store.

"totally the worst fish ever not a recommendation if you want to eat fish, seems as it was from 2 days due to the smell of it"
the worst service i have ever met. unacceptable behaviour for the civilised people. shame of the netherlands.
"the restaurant was recommended as “the place to be ” in hoek van holland if one was looking for high quality close to the international port of stena line. it has indeed an elegant ambiance, however, there are some area for improvement such as the unacceptably long waiting time for the table ( when 70% of the restaurant is empty), then the same for the courses when finally seated, the unedibly salty lobster soups and the lousy service: food consequently placed in front of the wrong person, water not served just trown on the table in bottles......en so on. the different fish and seafood dishes were fresh and high quality, however nothing special in concept and presentation. all in all the place was a disappointment, the overall experience did not justify the price."
we went to this place based on reviews and drove a good 30 minutes to eat here one evening. we both came away feeling disappointed after €110 meal for 
"the food is tasty and varied, but the idea to share dishes did not work for us. the brazed pigs cheeks with risotto had 5 nice meaty cheeks, but hardly any risotto. more risotto can be ordered separately as a side, but that brings the price to 20 euros. the stoba stew was mostly sauce and could have done with a staple. the naan bread on the menu is not the same as naan in england. as a thin pancake/pitta it was very little as a starter. so we left a bit hungry. having said that, the view towards the water and all the big boats going by is great. "
"excellent ambience and food let down by sharers pricing and relentless attempts to up-sell. ended up paying over €50 for small dinner, one small mineral water and one minute coffee. we did not ask for bill but over-efficient service left us feeling ushered out."
well the food was ok. had to ask for menu etc so service a bit slow. but it now has a order a few starters and mains to make a meal - but thats not what we wanted as we both like different food

"perhaps because of the look of the building (which looks very exclusive) my expectations were a little too high, but i was a little disappointed. we went there for a special lunch with friends, however, the food wasnt very special for the price we had to pay. i also didnt think the atmosphere was all that inviting either. however, the view was very nice."
"the view is good, the service was fine, and the food was tasty. on the other hand, we do not eat wheat because it causes us discomfort in a variety ways. we ordered a burger with no bread as there were really no other options. it was our mistake not to inquire but we assumed a burger would be all meat. it was obviously not as we both were uncomfortable not too long after eating. and while eating it, it seemed to have a meat loaf like texture. (we never order meat loaf because we know there is hidden danger.)"
"but the chicken satay i had was the weirdest combination of foods ive seen on a plate. the satay itself wasnt like the stuff you get in malaysia, and the accompanying salad, potato salad with extra mayonnaise, fries, pickled cabbage, and bread was truly bizarre. cool building though. "
"very nice location in hoek van holland, good service as well, however the food is not the best and to expensive"
"after dining at unicum some time ago, we decided to return and bring some other people along. like last time, it was very busy. we had a table just next to the entrance which was not so convenient. the food, like before, was good and service efficient. when in hoek van holland, this place will probably be a favorite, however, we would not plan to go there..."
"i was wondering, that we could not get any other table with better-rated restaurants in hoek van holland, but this one and there were no more reviews. but i am sure other guests died on hunger before which explains that there are no more reviews. the occupation of the restaurant was about 50% on saturday night. but we made it in 2 hours only for one main course and two beverages since it was too slow. the food itself was nicely prepared, but my saté (meat - skewer) was solid like a rock, and they forgot to top the salad dressing. the waitresses were friendly when they showed up. wondering, that they had no mussels as the main course in a seafood restaurant in an appropriate month. the fish my friends had was very greasy, and no sides but french fries included."
"ok looked and smelt ok, spoke in english to someone who thought the best way to communicate with me was to shout at the top of his annoying voi "
"i accept that i cannot speak dutch but i would have thought that a seafood restaurant would understand what is meant by “fish and chips”! the young man serving seemed incapable of taking this order. i managed to place and order for calamaris but the second meal of “fish and chips” seemed beyond his comprehension despite a helpful dutch person trying to assist. finally by pointing i managed to place an order for the 2 meals which cost some £35.00!!! then when i tried to pay using my credit card i was told they don’t accept credit cards. however the machine refused to accept my debit card also! at this point having come to the end of my tether we left in disgust. we had spent the previous 10 days travelling through the netherlands, germany and poland and encountered no difficulties so why this fish and chip shop which is directly by the ferry port to england has such a problem with an order for “fish and chips” completely eludes me! i was also surprised that the senior staff working behind the counter gave the young man no assistance at all. i will definitely not return. "
"delicious fish. beautiful view on the waterway. its typical dutch way of preparing fish, which i love."
"we waited for around 50min. for 3 portions. there is no process and service. also the quality is very minimum, not what you would expect when going to such a place."

"vispaleis is a nice name, but it does not really match with reality. its more or less a luxury fish and chips-store. nice for a sunday-afternoon bite with the family, but not for intimate dining. a fishy snackbar..."
"the location is great, in the former trainstation. but... the foodpresentation isn’t great. the waitresses were are asking to frequently if you want something to drink (the drinks are not included in the price). the dessert (always icecream in these sort of restaurant) is very cheap ice. the taste of the icecream is really poor!!!!"
if you are keen to spend some money to experience an ignorant and unskilled staff which is going to spoil your stomach with insufficient defrosted convenience products - go the 
"as a family of 5 who live in the same house and are a household, we were allowed into the restaurant terrace but only on a table without cover. the outside terrace (with cover) had still several tables available, but according to the waiter those were only available for couples. when it started to rain we could no longer sit outside without cover. we asked to sit at a different location, where 2 tables could be merged. this was not possible according to the staff. we were forced to leave when the rain became unbearable. no other option was discussabl "
"here you have 3 options, firstly the standard buffet with the usual suspects, sweet and sour pork etc, or you can choose from a heap of fresh ingredients and have them either wok fried, whereby your selected items are put in boiling water, then into the wok with your choice of sauce, or you can have your selected items fried on the grill teppenyaki style. the food all tasted a bit bland and not terribly inspiring, more a production line with a bit of theatre. having said that you can eat all you want and the staff are pleasant enough, and its not expensive. seems popular with the locals."
"you eat as much as you want for a very reasonable price. it is fun to make your choice of vegetables, fish or meats for the wok or the grill."
a quick pit stop for a drink. this place will not get a mention in the world atlas for cocktails but the service is nice and efficient
"i’ve tried this restaurant three times thinking that maybe i just picked the wrong thing but tonight was my final visit. the food was below average and the menu descriptions fictional, but the wait staff earned applause for their good service. so disappointing."
"we went here for lunch during weekend. once we took a seat at their terrace, it took a while before they came to help us. it felt like they saw us, but didn’t really feel the need to provide us service. after, we also had to ask ourselves for another drink as well. the tomato soup was delicious. it was a perfect spot in the sun, but service can be improved."
"arrived for a late lunch around 15.45 with a group of eight people & the staff took their sweet time to take our order. by that time (16.02) we were told that the kitchen would not be serving food after 16.00! if the waiter had told us that the kitchen closed at 16.00 we might have place our order immediately with the drinks order or gone somewhere else instead of wasting our time! the worst of it was that four of the group were guests there & were checking in, which was also why we waited to order. plus it was two minutes past four oclock, not really an issue for the kitchen i would have thought. very disappointing customer service."
"the restaurant is in a charming old building. the food was just not very well prepared and we did not like it very much. a huge portion of very salty smoked salmon as a starter, it was ok, but not the best quality, and as a main i had a pasta dish, which really is not to be recommended. other people at the table had fish, which looked ok, but was rather boring: it was fried fish, without anything added to it."
"we ate here with a coupon deal, fixed menu with a few choic "
"the beer was served by a lovely attentive waiter. we sat outside in comfortable chairs enjoying the sunshine. we did not have a big appetite so we shared three pieces of brown bread with fried egg, roastbeef and potato sausage. a bad choice. it was ok quality but a weird mixture."
"we visited this eetcafe with another aussie couple during june. it has a limited menu, friendly staff and a great atmosphere. meals ordered were spare ribs, which were very good, and the local fish, kabeljauw, which we thought was cooked well but not very flavorsome."
had lunch her and the food was nothing special. i had the open face ham & cheese which could have had some more ham. my wife had a chicken dish which she said was just fine.
they can’t seem to deliver the food all together - why is it ok for half the table to eat and the other to watch - slow service - and a stinky smelly terrace allowing people to smoke which came inside the restaurant and stank - not worth a visit.
"after recommendations of friends, we decided to have dinner at wonders. unfortunately we were very disappointed as we had to wait for a very long time for our main course (but it was busy so we didnt complain). when main course finally arrived, we were told our kids were too noisy (they obviously had waited a very long time for their food to arrive). clearly, not a child friendly place (despite having a child menu so one would think otherwise). would not recommend going here with kids. very disappointing."
"had dinner here a few nights ago and was very disappointed. two of us ordered the peking duck salad which was a plate of soggy salad, even though we had asked for no dressing and 3 minuscule pieces of duck which you needed a magnifying glass to see. i complained to the waiter who said he would tell the chef. we of course never heard any answer or apology. the portions are very small here and i am not a big eater. definitely not worth the money!"
"the food was bad and the service terrible. they forgot almost everything. there were also things on our bill that we didnt have, and they said we did have them"
"we arrived quite late, the place was packed, i think there was not enough waiters, it was a total disaster. they were not nice, we had to wait hours for a soup for the kids and when i asked if we could have the soup at least for the kids cos it was late, she turned round saying yes it will come when it is your turn.. then when it actually came to the table, the soup was boiling! when our food finally was served, it was ok but not great and very expensive for what it was."
very negative!!! no menu in english. very bad attitudine of waiters. you don’t get what you order. very expensive. i strongly reccomend not to eat in this place.
"very nice place with good food. we were there with friends, about 15 people. the service was a bit slow and very inelegant in serving the wine..."
"we were on a 1-day-visit in bergen. i checked the trip-advisor-reviews before we chose a restaurant, so we decided to eat at fabels. at first sight we liked the charming and welcoming decor but unfortunately this was the only thing that was charming and welcoming in this restaurant. although we were asked quite quickly to order a drink, we had to wait an eternity before one of the waitresses (4 of them standing at the bar, chatting...) reacted to our waving, because we had to make a hand-sign before anyone would come to ask what we would like to eat. we almost asked ourselves if we had put on frodos ring, because we felt completely invisible. whereas the other guests (who spoke dutch) were treated kindly, we felt like undesirable strangers. the boss passed several times at our table, he didnt say hello, didnt ask if everything was okay, he ignored us, but he was friendly with the dutch-speaking guests. the food eventually arrived, it was okay, but not fantastic. we left as soon as we could because we really didnt feel at ease. far away from the cosy atmosphere that was described in some reviews. unlike our usual habit, we didnt leave a tip, because we really disliked the unfriendly and cold service. we wont go back to this place and we dont recommend it to non-dutch-speaking people. "
"we were there pretty early, but is was quite busy already. the tables for two were very close together. food is not too fancy, but good."
"crowded place indicating that the food is good. stay away from the nacho todos, but the spare ribs were good. so was the parma ham, soft and tasty. dogs are allowed inside and is not a good combination when it rains outside. smell wet dog."
"the place is nicely located - centrally in bergen ... it is indeed quite an intimate setting and one feels relax and at ease. the service was really good and quite attentive - job well done. the only reason we rate the restaurant as average, is as a consequence of the food. the appetizers were just ok but the main course was not meeting expectations ... some of the dishes had been too long in the oven or warmer and resulting in dry food ... not succulent. the burgers are great, but without any greens on the side it was a bit naked ... one small pack of fries to share with two is equally astonishing ... i wonder how that small pack of fries would have looked if there was only one of us to order the burger :) ! the bar and standard is quite high with us ... weve done a good number of places and this was not what we had expected. we will not come back even though we live close by."
nice menu but food quality is very poor. friendly staff.
"beautifully located restaurant, tastefully decorated inside and a great terrace outside and very good food, what could possibly go wrong here? well, it is all about the service which i consider to be unwelcoming at best. where to start? we began our evening with a drink on the sunny terrace. at dinnertime the pepper, salt and oil were removed from our table, and we were told that if we wanted to have something to eat, we had to relocate to another shady part of the terrace. all tables, including the one we had to relocate to, had a sign reserved. 50% of the tables remained empty the entire evening, and other people were served dinner at the table we had to relocate from. the waiters gave us little to no attention. when we paid, we had to walk inside, while other waiters carried a mobile card reader. in short: we feel that the way you are treated is based on whether you are local or liked. that is a bit of a prejudice that is associated with bergen altogether, and i hate to see it confirmed like this. the food deserves a more pleasant and welcoming venue. therefore, three stars, where it could easily have been four or five."
"average, over-priced food and slow, pretty useless service. a lunch taking 2 hours only due to waiting for a menu, to order, for food. too slow and not proactive or befitting a luxe restaurant. disappointing."
"nice restaurant, sometimes overcrowded on sunny biking days. simple menu card but good quality food. great to fill in a i dont know what to cook day."
"went there last night with my wife and two friends. two of us ordered the fish of the day, one took the tournedos, and one the meal salad with chevre cheese. we all liked our dishes, yet we found the portions to be very scarce, especially the fish. also, the accompaniement (vegetables) seemed the miniature version of the real thing. the bill came to 150 € for the four of us, including 8 glasses of wine, water and coffee. my conclusion is that in this restaurant the quality is good, yet the quantity is poor."
bergen binnen is nicely located and lots of parking lots. service is good and food ok.  i van recommend this place.
"we had a dinner in a pleasant environment. wine list is nice, and worth. starter was a steak tartare, which was prepared very well. this was followed by fowl for my partner, which was prepared very well, and fish roodbaars, which was not prepared well at all (still raw and fishy). so a bit of a pity. cheeses were ok but not remarkable. so overall not a bad choice, but not as good as some reviews make you believe."
popular restaurant food well prepared and good presentation had 3 course menu choice is quite limit 
"michelin 1 fork but its not worth ! nice atmosphere, friendly staff but food was very disappointing. thai chicken soup but there was no chicken in it. fish was not good. poor quality and a chef that cant cook."
i was visiting my hometown and decided to have dinner with old friends in bergen. we ended up at julies - right in the town cente 
"although we had good experience during past visits we were this time disappointed with the quality of the food served. the starters, smoked salmon and tuna were acceptable but the rib eye as main course was unacceptable and very chewy , the vegetables served with the steak were hard and did not seem to be cooked well. certainly a disappointing visit this time !"
"place is okay, food is nice for the price you pay. had no issue to complain about was fairly satisfied"
"the food is okay, i ordered the burger & it was mildly disappointing and overcooked. the worst thing about my experience at julie! was the service and the incredibly rude manager. we waited for over an hour for our food and when we complained, the manager first of all asked us if we wanted to leave and then he tried to blame the problem on us. he feebly offered us free drinks (which only turned out to be house wine & soda) and avoided questions of a discount. all in all, the area around the restaurant has lots of different places to eat which i am sure have much better service, and i would recommend to go eat at loetje where the service was great & food much bette "
"i went for dinner with some friends. after waiting for more than an hour for our order, the owner came to us and asked us if we wanted to leave and said it would be fine because he said sorry and we had no right to be annoyed about the situation. they didnt apologize and tried to make it our fault because of wrong way of ordering. we have never been treated so badly in a restaurant and will definitely not come back. totally ridiculous and rude service ! "
we visited (couple) during the week for a late lunch - it was not extremely crowd 
"as always the food is really good and tasty, but the service is such a let-down! we had made a booking as we were a party of 7. when we arrived, it wasnt busy so we could just go sit anywhere. they hadnt made any table ready for us despite our reservation. as it had rained that morning we had to dry our own chair and drag two tables together to suit 7 people. no one of the staff offered any help, and we had to ask if they could please wipe the table dry and clea "
"beautifully located in the hart of the town. old fashioned decorations, old fashioned menu, although they do serve cappuccino and espresso. nice atmosphere, service is friendly but slow, cappucino lukewarm and the brown bread with kroketten... lets say i have tasted better. not bad though."
"sorry guys, but this isnt chinese food. i ordered a tomato soup and it was some kind of ketchup with sugar and pieces of chicken. then i had some sort of pork deep fried and served with warm canned fruit (hence the title of the review, see picture). then i gave up, and even if i was hungry as a lion i didnt have the courage to ask for anything else. if you have to come to this place - like... every other place within 20km is closed - order the ramen: they are at least edib "
fabulous food but sooo expensive we had a takeaway and the portions were large but paid £65 for four dishes 😳😳😳
"we ate siu la ngau lau sie and  kon po ngau pin  . it looked colourful and nice. but only the vegetables tasted good. the meat was tasteless, unrecognisable. we doubted if it really was tenderloin. what a pity. the only thing i can recommend are the baked bananas. staff was indifferent."
went there a couple of nights back with my wi 
decent food for a decent price. service was a bit slow but very kind. there was only one vegetarian option for main course.
"visited the restaurant on a sunday morning for a cup of coffee. i couldnt find a registration form at the entrance of the restaurant. after i ordered coffee at the collection desk, i was rudely asked if i had already completed a form. when i answered negatively, a form and pen were thrown at me. we finished our coffee and enjoyed the view."
"fastfood-style self service restaurant. a bit pricy, but food was okay. nice views from the deck. nothing fancy, but if you just want to eat, you can go here."
"it is some kind for fast food fish restaurant. self-service with mainly fish. prices are quite reasonable compared to the amount of food you get, but do not expect quality. good for a quick bite."
"nice terrace overlooking the small harbor. self-service . menu offers mainly fried fish, including soles.moderate price but also moderate quality.french fries seem to be prepared in the same oil as the fish. clean."
"situated direct at the harbour and near to the ferry to schiermonnikoog, this is a quick eat restaurant. the food was tasty and the service was quick. the prices for small snacks were reasonable but the menus were pricey. the large room felt more like a cantine than a restaurant but it is fine for a quick, good meal."
"our fish portions were very small and we had a little bit of vegetables. the setting is dated and no ambiance. take cash as master cards or visa cards are not been accepted. this could be problematic for tourists. this restaurant was on the quiet side and still our waiter forgot to take our order. sorry guys, but service delivery was lacking. one a positive note: the fish was cooked to perfection. "
i found place itself somehow wear 
"it,s such a shame..we went to this part of groningen because there was an article in the volkskrant...one of the best fish restaurants in the netherlands.it was not worth the tr "
"im citing the slogan of a famous rotterdam fish shop, which very well summarizes the core business of t ailand (island). opening hours are limited, but can be retrieved from the - extremely slowly working - website. true, most fishermen are not whizzkids. but fishkids they will be, certainly friday after 3pm, when the fresh catch is brought in. we came in for a sandwich with warm-smoked salmon, which was ok. the espresso was surprisingly good - not what you typically get in dutch fishers ports!"
"though the place looks quite nice, the food is just bad. there is no atmosphere, modern lighting is flickering really annoyin "
"nothing good to say about this restaurant. not fresh, taste is bad, seems like there is no cook working here or at least no one who have studied to become a chef."
fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
"had dinner here and ordered sea bass and dorade, both filets and catch of the day. the bass was a bit tough. the dorade was excellent. in an effort to cut waste the restaurant allows to order fries and salads free of charge as extras."
"during our visit it was quite busy, maybe the reason that the staff couldn’t really get a good grip on the service. resulting in almost finished main course before the fries and vegetables were brought to the tab "
"the restaurant is nicely located near the lake, with a great view of the lake. especially nice after a nice walk. food is ok, but for us a bit overpriced vs the quality. service could be quicker"
...not exceptional. we had lunch there. we appreciated the fresh fish but the vegetables and fries were just ok. traditional decoration. i think there are better places.
"the restaurant is at a great location, between the harbour and the sea. you can enjoy both views from within the restaurant. on the sea side you can see the ships coming  "
"service was nice. food was good. menu looked quite balanced , better then earlier times we visited. having ostrich in hoogerheide who would have guessed?? portions nice. ambience little confusing but overall not a bad place to visit. if you stick to just a main course or the daily special moneywise doable . they even have special entrees easy to share! do not expect high cuisine , you will have a nice evening!"
"we got a feeling that our waiter forgot about us initially. at first before our order was taken, and then later on, after we finished our starter, the same thing happened. the restaurant was pretty full, but you would expect that the staffing is geared to deal with that. after we reminded the staff about the main course, it took another 30 mins. we had a good time nevertheless, but to really judge this restaurant it deserves another visit. the food was tasty, so i would recommend trying it."
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"restaurant orangerie mattemburgh is situated on the mattemburgh estate, and occupies the former orangerie building. the mattemburgh estate provides a large parking lot, guided and self guided walks and a guided tour of the mansion (guided tours for a fee). however, our goal was the orangerie restaurant for lunch. nice outdoor seating area, good service of the staff, but a bit wooden, to be expected in the netherlands, swinckels beer, and my travel companion was very positive about the carpaccio sandwich, but regarding my order, fried eggs with bacon on bread i must say that the chef should attend a refresh course how to fry eggs and to present it on slices of bread. this bread was very tasty by the way. also the amount of bacon used was a bit disappointing. prices were of an elevated variety, the dutch way. to summarize, restaurant orangerie is an interesting place to visit, but on some point there is room for improvement."
"the food was terrible, the service poor, we waited 2 hours before the main course and rather expensive dish was served. so what happened…. staff disinterested/poorly trained. who was in the kitchen? the asparagus soup was warm water with a few pieces of asparagus and tasteless, the 2nd version.. very likely out of a packet. after waiting another 1.5 hours (without any explanation from the staff) the main course arrived, medium steak was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside… even the chips were hard and poorly cooked. never in the 32 years that have i lived in holland have i had such a poor dinner. no excuses from the staff. fyi there were only 3 tables of guests at the restaurant this evening. waste of money and a very disappointing evening."
"we have dined at mattemburgh several times but the last times it was disappointing, good food but expensive, staff is not always in a good mood."
we had the “ oriental menu” including choice of a soup and a 4 multiple ingredient dish... with the choice of bami or nasi.. with coffee or thea... very tasty ... we asked to replace the bami for mihoen... ( at extra charge we discovered later on the billl)
"this is a nice restaurant and the food looks great, but there is one waitress who can better be given a job behind the scenes as she is scaring away customers with her unfriendly service"
we walked here all the way from the harbor (20 mts) and had made a reservation. seems that dogs are not welcome so we are happy not to eat here. you should be clear about your anti dog policy in the first place.🐶 it would have given us the possibility to find a dog friendly restaurant in this by the way pretty unexciting village.
what would otherwise have been a been a good meal was totally spoilt by the slowest service imaginable. it took a full hour and a half to get food from when we arrived. no one offered us even bread - we had to go search for it as the kids were staving. no one told us the kitchen was struggling when we got there - we had reserved a table. after we complained they just said sorry we are busy. thats just not good enough when it spoils a night out. really they are in the business of giving a good experience so people return and on that basis you have to say they failed. only reason they get 2/5 is when the food finally arrived it was actually quite nice but by then who really cared?
"mussels here were well prepared and tasted fine. in fact all the food was fine, service was friendly and on time, decent wines. therefore a fine option, not something you need to make a detour for."
"worst seafood ever. the carpaccio was not made of beef. horrible taste. all other seafood we ordered either had wired smell, a bit stink , or just very not fresh. even the staff themselves agreed with things tasted bad! absolutely not recommended!!!"
we had dinner with the family on sunday evening when we arrived at the marina.the staff was friendly and the food was good. view was very nice at the grevelingen.
we arrived at the marina at evening and we went to the nearest restaurant it is not the best but not the worst tooo it s ok
"the sailors inn is an average restaurant. the fish was a bit dry, the clams were okay but not great. the food can be better, but you wont go home hungry. the staff is very friendly."
"... and that is about it. poor service (they might all have been students that night), dirty table, cold starter, no drink refills at the table, no cleaning of the seafood shells, kitchen without ambition ( somehow reminded me of microwaved concenience food). i dont understand how a cook can allow to have these plates leave the kitchen under his resposibilty. surprisingly good dutch auxerrois / pinot gris, way too high in pri "
"at the border of the port this cozy restaurant invites for dinner. we reserved a table at the window which was prepared for us. while drinking our aperitif the waiter gave our table to other people, which wasnt fun "
self service restaurant lacking in atmosphere and charm only saved by fantastic views and ease of parking. its such a shame that a little effort isnt made to make guests feel welcome as outside of peak season (may) it seemed pretty empty and it closed at 9.30. food was ok nice fresh self service salad bar. only one type of red or white wine available but coffee was good. i would try the outside terrace in warm weather as the setting is wonderful.
"the seafood is not bad (maatjes, shellfish, fish), although they dont know how to prepare fish other than baking in the pan. the service is horrible (waiters, so-called manager, even staff at the shop next door) - ive never experienced such behaviour and dont recommend to anyone. will definitely never come back. if i could rate this restaurant with 0, i would."
we went there several times.the menu is typical dutch.food is fine but the  service is very slow. their crème caramel is really good
"fish is fresh! that is good! waiters take their time and if you go during lunch time make sure your have several hours. it takes time at this place. the baked cod, gebakken vis, has a different coating than traditional... you must like  "
"cannot fault the food especially for fish lovers but the service did not match the standard of food. paying this much you should not have to ask where your meal is nor give up waiting to be asked if you would like dessert or coffee. a dont care, disinterested attitude by waiting staff. shame."
"food ok, with some nice details such as algues in the salad, pain de mer, which appears to be a sourdough bread preparation based upon filtered sea wate "
"the fish is from the fish store behind a moveable wall, and thus fresh. well-prepared - not special. service is friendly but was slow when we were there, and we were forgotten a few times."
"with the current owners, vluchthaven has changed from a luxury restaurant to a fairly simple brasserie in which you sit on second- or third-hand furniture. fish is the mainstay of the cuisine which otherwise has mediterranean traits.the food was lovely otherwise, and their white house wine quite good. on the thursday that we visited, the restaurant was pretty understaffed with only one waiter for some 20-25 clients, but his friendliness compensated our waiting time. prices, however, were quite high; we spent some 50-60 euros for a 3-course dinner."
"this is a nice restaurant, only you cant see that its closed between 17:00 and 18:0 "
"new owner and style restaurant which we must try, a birthday was the right occasion i would say. we entered via the side entrance and started with a drink outside. that went ok, we had one menu and ordered from that menu… bit strange we did not get more menus but i thought they assumed we were going inside to order (as we said we wanted to dine inside). anyway, there were plenty of girls serving but they just did their thing and did not look around it was sometimes hard to get their attention. some were ok in the service but one was a bit clumsy. anyway, starters were about to be served so we went inside (still having a very nice look over the water-edge though). starters were a shared vegetarian bruschetta, shared meat-platter, paprika soup (soup of the day) and croquettes. portion size was quite good, the soup even came with two thick slices of bread. they kindly asked if the main could be served and those came all within a minute or 3-4 (not direct) accompanied with a huge portion of fries. we ordered 2x the spare ribs (very tasty and good), chicken satay with fries and fried rice on the plate (huge salad also), salmon with bearnaise sauce, sea-bass filets and tender pork fillets. the dishes were very well made up and portion size was more than adequate. after finishing the mains we ordered desserts, coconut with pineapple (it was some kind of coconut whip cream look, tasted great), chocolate cake brownie with white chocolate ice-cream, sorbet and 2x yoghurt with crumble and fruit. mainly the yoghurt with fruit was overpriced i would say. actually all the desserts but not to bad all in all. we had a good evening the bill did not break the bank and the food itself is really good quality, but the service was below par, in particular to the food quality. i do think the boss is in the kitchen and he needs some senior girs/guys to overlook the servers. than it would be the best food in the best place with great service, now we end with just not that. keep up the good work and youll get there chef!"
"food was average, staff friendly, kitchen with low capacity & staff decided to serve two couples coming in later first such that we had to wait for little bit less than 1 hr for our lunch. by that time the couples already paid the check. only a sorry, not a normal gesture e.g. like offering the drinks for free. not coming back."
"... but still not the high quality that i am looking for in schouwen-duivenland. friendly waiters, good location, will be good in summer."
"too expensive, sharing one little salat and one little bowl of patatoes for 6 people eating spare ribbs at 16 €/person and nobody (not even the kids eaten an adult portion) felt ok with this plate, some spare ribs were half burned and the stuff seemed to avoid us as we got no bread and butter as others and drinks took a long time too. a little beer for 2,20 € is kind of ok if the service is good. but this place seemed to have enough business now with holland people so that they can treat german tourists as bad as  "
"the food isn’t half bad but the service and attitude of the staff was absolutely horrible! we reserved a table for wednesday pizza night. three of us ordered one pizza each only eating half of the pizza each. in other words we had one and a half pizza left we didn’t eat. we spoke dutch to the waitress but we do have an accent as it is not our first or second language it is our third language actually. we politely asked the waitress if we could have our pizza (worth €15 give or take) for take away. she had no problem understanding us when she came over for payment or even when we ordered. after my husband paid the bill she said thanks and good night. my husband was confused because she did not bring us our left over pizza yet. when he asked her about it she simply said she threw it away and started ignoring us. we waited ten minutes to see if she would come over and explain why she thew it away. but she just kept ignoring us hoping we would go away. now i’m sorry but people in third world countries are dying of starvation and she thinks it’s ok to throw away €15 worth of food after we specifically said we wanted to take it home so we don’t waste money or food. after my husband went over to the waitress to ask politely what’s going to happen now. the manager stepped in and told the waitress to keep doing her work. my husband explained the situation and the manager simply replied with sorry maybe she didn’t understand you. and i firmly asked what she didn’t understand about i would like to take my left over pizza home? she turned around smugly and told me i don’t need to speak to her this way. this was absolutely uncalled for and horrible service from a manager. we have a right to be upset because they threw away our food. after a long argument she asked us if we would like another pizza or our money back. i am no fool, no way i’m waiting for more food to be wasted by these people. i asked for my money back. she came over after two minutes and threw €10 on the table. no sorry for the mistake or mixup. only the cash tossed on the table like a dog! i will make sure to let everyone now what wonderful service we received at this not so wonderful restaurant."
"we did visit the restaurant last weekend for the first time. we ate some mussels and deserts....the frecnch fries by the mussels were for one person, not for 2 and that was the same for the mussels....the portions were litt "
"we came there to try mussels menu advertised on the website of the restaurant. however it wasnt available. we ended up with gratin mussels as a starter which were good. the main dishes however were just ok, without any plus or minus. average salmon and pasta. i was very surprised to see in my pasta with gambas lots of bacon. good im not a vegetarian i though "
"sadly la plaisanterie was the only place we found open for coffee, in this pretty harbour square with its lovely, seasonally-decorated hous "
we made an online reservation. when we arrived at the place the woman was very unfriendly and told us in a very strict and unprofessional way that the online reservation is only for the inside and outside there is no free table. we asked of maybe later ist possible because we preffered to sit outside- no she said. also she didnt try to make us stay- we had a great evening with delicious dinner at the restaurant at the other side of the harbour (watching that one table at the terrasse of the unfriendly waitress for 2 persons we wanted stay free all evenin 
the terrace is located near the old harbor. food was ok but not exceptional. we were served quickly and enjoyed a sunny afternoon with view on the boats.
the restaurant is prominently situated at the edge of the marketplace and the end of the yacht harbour. it promises more than it keeps. average quality at high prices and poor service.
had a quick lunch here out on the terrace. salad was good and tasty with some fresh bread. service friendly enjoyable place to sit in the sun for lunch.
"we love the food here, everything is beautifully made and presented so has an amazing kitchen. it’s a little on the pricy side here for it’s location. staff are good but always seem very serious so come across very frosty. we must have been there about 30 times last year and we still don’t raise much of a smile from the staff - maybe they hate us! ;)"
"had dinner with friends there very recently. lovely ambience, a very comprehensive and original menu. the food was well presented and more than deliciou "
"went in for a quick bite during lunch time. friendly face service, accomodating to vegetarian request. glass of fresh orange juice (delicious) and a sandwich-bun with mozzarella, tomato, pesto(tasty and filling). together 10 euros."
wow i can’t believe the service over there. we where with a group of 8 people. the food was cold!!! after we went to the club and they couldn’t find or reservation. jose and one girl came with the bottle’s with a bad attitude .. after all bad service never never again!!!!!!!!!!! rude employee’s
"this place has a really nice terrace next to the roundabout. we had coffee and vlaai here. what bothered me is the standard choices of vlaai, it seems no one in this part of the country haves an incliment to differentiate from the rest. its all the same everywher "
"ate here with friends during a cycling trip last weekend: the service is very good and the interior is great as well. the food looked amazing, but the taste was not really good: my fish soup was very salty and i presume my stomach cramps were due to this soup ;( my friends hamburger was also not very good, the price was around 10eur, but he received cheap chicken-nugget like patties on a bun. our other friend had no complaints with his hearty pancake."
"the paal6 has a lovely location right by the sea and is beautifully decorated. also the food is very nice, with some lovely choices and they are well prepared for kids too. unfortunately the staff, with some exceptions who were very nice, is quite unfriendly and inattentive. i think this is a shame, because if it weren’t for this, the place would have received 5 points from me."
22.5 € for a 150gr. fish is to much and the one gamba and four crispy cute chips was very funny sorry but that was a disaster dinner
we stopped here in the hope for a late lunch / early dinner but were informed no food could be ordered at that time - it was approx. 4pm. naturally we were disappointed and hungry! we did however stay for drink 
"went there for diner with family, food was ok but overpriced. you have to pay for the view, close to the beach. before 20:00 very noisy due to kids. service rather lame and not paying attention. dogs allowed. not recommended...."
"the paal 6 is a bar/restaurant on poles on a beautiful, seemingly endless beach in noord holland. it is one of the few beachside places to remain open during winter, but the surroundings are also very busy during summer. so if calm and serenity are your thing, maybe look a few hundred meters to the left/right: the beach is huge, and most people stay very close to the restaurant( "
"we recently visited the coast of north holland and after a lovely walk through the dunes and along the shore we decided to stop for some lunch. this restaurant is up on poles, nestled against the dunes, and has a beautiful view of the ocean. after a walk along the beach in december its nice and warm inside. on the afternoon we were there it was quiet on the beach and in the restaurant. the menu is typical dutch fare, paninis, some sandwiches etc. prices are high compared to other restaurants. the service was slow and surly. the food we ordered was fair to go "
"actually i would have liked to give brammetje a good. but this is not an option. brammetje serves good, straightforward food. the ambiance is nice and the staff is very friendly and attentive. the food could have been more balanced in terms of calories; the menu was pretty heavy. but over all certainly a nice place to go if youre in a beach oriented place like julianadorp."
"we went there on a saturday night because we wanted to have a pleasant dinner. we had no problems getting a reservation. the ambiance was nice, the table setting was nice, the bathrooms were nice and clean – so thats a big pl "
"dont quite get the concept of italian tapas. italian food is wholesome, its filling and plentiful. if youre hungry the small platters and having to order from a limited menu will frustrate you. oh and you have to write down your order and hand it to the waitress...🙄"
the spa was full with a one hour waiting list so we decided to have a quick lunch. i ordered what i thought was the quickest and simplest thing from the menu. an italian salad. what i got after waiting for more than 30minutes was not at all what i expected. a plate with tiny pieces of random things on it that left me wholly unsatisfied.
this place was not good at all. starter ( calamari) and kids’ pasta were way too simple and nothing special abou 
"i ordere tom yum prawns. it arived in a bowl drenched in half a cup of oil with no chilli, coriander, lime, garlic or ginger in site. when i brought it under the attention of the owner she rudely informed me that this is their way of cooking tom yum. i did not eat it but was billed €13 for it. restauranteurs like this are tipping their customers off ....but at their own detriment. they might cash in on us once but times are tough and and ignorant attitude like this will count against them on the long ru "
went here for a saturday evening dinner. it is located near a holiday park and therefore lot of people from that park were dining there with children. as the (nicely looking) interior is made of lots of metal and other hard surfaces it is quite noisy. the interior itself is industrial style and very nice looki 
"the restaurant is part of a big holiday resort. place is clean and looks quite nice. staff is very friendly. food is ok, but could be better. the choice of dishes is interesting, also trying to serve asian dishes and other out of the box stuff might be a bridge too far."
"came to this store to try the pizza take away service as our dog was not allowed into the restaurant. friendly reception and ample parking. pizza however was a real let down. pizza dough tasted like cardboard and quickly heated, toppings were ok. if you enjoy pizza go elsewhere or buy a frozen one in the supermarket. poor value for money. do not recommend! "
"there is an information button for each menu. but only half of the dishes actually have something about allergens. so i ordered a salad (which was on the menu twice, with two different prices). when i got the salad, it had different nuts in it. i asked the waiter to bring me a new salad, as i have an extreme nut allergy. after a short while, a waitress came and told us in an impossible tone that i had to ask if there were nuts in a dish. they would also charge me for the old salad and half price for the new one. there was no information about the contents of the salad via the info button and waiters could not be beckoned to the table either, as this was always ignored (we had tried to order drinks beforehand). in the eu, every restaurant and every snack bar is obliged to point out the major allergens. this includes nuts in particular! this information was not taken into account her "
never order any seafood her 
"we went for a long walk on the beach and decided to have a hot chocolate and maybe something to eat. the restaurant is outdated and furnished with cheap tables and seating and lacks warmth and atmosphere. a waiter came to our table and said drinks? no hello, no how are you? prices are high so we were thinking of leaving as we saw staff just wandering by, not really helping clients. but there was one, shall we say voluptuous lady, that did come to our table, said hello with a smile and started chatting so we decided to stay. unfortunately, the hot chocolate that we ordered had been on the stove too long so it was burnt but the kind lady immediately replaced it without questions being asked. we had some snacks as well (tosti, soup, sausage roll) and these were ok but we noted that the kind lady who served us was the only one doing her job. the rest just lingered near the kitchen. message to the owner: train your personel in hospitality and service (except the one lady mentioned)."
"went here for dinner, portions are generous and prices decent, not cheap but not overly expensive. also the quality of the food is quite good! we really enjoyed the dishes, made perfectly, portion sizes good and taste was perfec "
"wanted to have some nice drink and read a book. they had no coctails on the menu, so i ordered gin & tonic. they brought me the tiniest glass possible, i was able to pour not even a third of the tonic in it, so it tasted like pure gin. i had to ask for a bigger glass because it was undrinkable. they added the squeezing lemon thingy stick in the drink, but the lemon was stuck on it from the other side... so even though the squeezing stick is in your drink, forget about squeezing your lemon in the drink. nobody speaks english.."
"i visit ouddorp a few times a year, when the sun shines and ive been to c-side before for drinks. this time, however, i went for diner. i ordered a cheeseburger and the burger was horrible. it was obviously one of those packeged, frozen burgers,which can be ok. but it was nasty of flavour, with just a little melted cheese on a sloppy bun. there was a little slaw and a slice of tomato next to it, but not enough to hide the bad flavour. no sauce, no vegetables on the burger. i was shocked by the standard. i ate half of the burger because i was hungry but i did tell the staff my complaints about the burger and how i was unsatisfied. i asked to only pay for half the burger, because that was how much i ate, but the staff would not do so. the burger was €4,50, so were talking about €2,25, the price of a drink. she could have giving me a free drink, as a symbol. you want your customers to be happy and satisfied, right? when i told her that me and my friends (5 of us) would never come back, she did not seem to care one bit. which is her right, but having worked in restaurants myself, this kind of service is below standard and pretty shameful i think. the rest of the staff was quite friendly and they lost a big tip on this kind of behaviour. i hope the owner reads this, because he/she just lost a few €100 and a regular clientele over €2,25. not to mention the bad reviews well be giving. were taking our money to another beach bar."
"had lunch here last weekend. it was a lovely day, not too hot and behind the glass screens it was lovely to sit outside with views of the sea. we ordered large cappuccinos but were given normal sizes. they handled it well though and gave us a second cappuccino each. the sizes of the meals were huge. prices were good for the amount you get. dont expect anything fancy, but if you are looking for a nice meal on a beautiful beach, this is a good place to go. parking is close, as is a playground for the children. "
"sunny day.  weating time 1 hour for drinks en 1,5 hour for food. bad service people where leaving.  dont go here if you want to have a good time at the sea."
i can’t really say much about the restaurant or food as we waited for 25 minutes for a menu which never arrived & gave up! we asked two separate people & not one of them returned! so we left & went to zee down the road where we had a delicious meal & great service.
"beautiful seaside location. beach house atmosphere. slow and disorganised service, forgetting and mixing up orders. some members of the staff are rude, ( to be fair, many other are polite ). diverse quality of meals served"
"slow and unfriendly staff, takes too much time to clean the tables and food was okay. sorry, but no 1? we defenitely expected more..."
i was in the natural high for two times. once i was nearly not serviced and had to wait quite a while although it was not even half full. another time i got reseat 
we were there with the 6 of us. we ordered careys (some chicken and some gambas). tast was ok but ingredients were very poor.
"the food has no taste there (at least what we have eaten), but its very expensive.  unfortunately, our kids were foodpoisoned in our last day of holiday."
"setting great overlooking beach , food average ,,slightly short but vert friendly staff  good for lunch with surf shop next door , supper slightly disappointing with limited menu however still a,fun place to be"
"popped in here for a drink whilst our teens did the beach kite buggies. the coffee was very nice and staff attentive and friendly. the decor is really cool and of course views of the ocean were great. the food smelled nice (deep fried) but looked quite sad even though the menu was quite varied. we didnt eat here as it didnt look appetising. also, unfortunately the toilets stank. i could smell them before i opened the door. "
"visited this beachclub for the second time. three times is a charm is the saying, but we will not come back to find out if that is really tr "
"on evening of 30 august, 4 adults came expecting dinner and reasonable service in exchange for a reaonsable price.instead, we were met with a level of aburupt rudeness which none of had experienced in year "
"unfriendly service team, especially in you are not a native speaker. actually it was our second try there. but:  never again!"
"we know this place many years. in these days of our vacation we went there two times. the place has been renovated, which is looking very goo "
food was okay but really nothing special. we had a burger and some other stuff you have on the beach. was there for dinner on a weekday and didnt needed a reservation. not like at the sister location bijmarc the service was friendly and attentive. its a good choice if you are in the area and want dinner with a view to the sea.
basic bar food. good fries. funny tasting sauce with fish and chips and the sole. fresh salad. generally large portions.
"following many reviews we visited this store for dinner twice and were not really excited. this place is popular due to its excellent location on the beach. on weekends it is packed, many tables reserved and little or no choice of outside seating. during peak hours one feels the kitchens struggles to keep up the quality. had the impression food was prepared hours in advance and had been sitting a while. choice of menu good. great place for drinks and snacks. service friendly and helpful. great for a pit stop, less so for dinner. "
"called for a drink - took ages for staff to come and clear the table we sat at. the waiter then didnt really wipe the tables, just dusted everything on to the floor so you were stood in the previous occupants food remains. ordered a beer and prosecco- the prosecco was flat with no bubbles as it should have. when trying to pay no one came near us and in the end we had to go find someone to pay our money too."
"nice location with great and spacious terrace on beautiful beach however, food is just ok. service is incredibly slow and not motivated at all. smiling is not a common attitude here. upper notch price with low range service on a great location with many opportunities to improve. "
"even though the front side of the menu says ask our staff about alergens, the waiter had no idea what i mean when i asked if its possible to get a glutenfree bread. i asked also in dutch, he still didnt know. nevermind, imma have a salad. the salad was unfortunately drenched in oil, a green oily puddle was forming at the bottom of the bowl, large as soup. they have literally 3 drinks on the menu, managed to bring me the one i did not order."
"the interior looks nice. the view is nice as well. even though there were only 20 guests, it took the staff (4 people) 15 minutes to take our order. the food was mediocre and the prices were not. staff not helpfull, grumpy."
"food and service where really not great. blonde girl in service was really rude, she didnt even bother to explain the menu."
"very nice menus, but classical, nothing very innovative, special seervice in restaurant was very good indeed"
"had a fletcher burger in the hotels restaurant and found a piece of hard, sharp plastic in my food. the incident kind of ruined my stay in this otherwise nice hotel. will definitely not come here to eat."
"we arrived happily and went to the beach, we had booked a table at the restaurant for 7pm with our two childre "
"the food is ok, weve definitely eaten better in ouddorp. service is cordial and correct. but they make you really feel that youre a tourist..."
"staff are very friendly and provide a decent service. parking is easy, just around the corner, which is also worth mentioning. elaborate menu with specials (game was available when we visited). we wanted to share a main course and they had no issues with that and even reduced the price because we did not need the fries and salad that came with it. kids had the typical dutch kids menu but we tried the calf liver, the sole (3 pieces, fried in stead of panfried in butter) and steaks. all okay and decenty cooked but given the price and relative to paal 10, we were not overwhelmed. "
"limited choice, small portions, not very tastefull and rather expensive. prefer eatong outside. hotel is ok. very good beds, good service."
"i came here several times while staying at the hotel. the hotel itself is very nice, however, the restaurant is really expensive, the portions are small, the food is average and the service is pretty terrible. the staff are friendly but youre better off ordering everything all at once because once they leave your table they will not come back. as i said, i went to the restaurant several times (at least 5) and my experience was the same each time. "
"the portions are very small. i ordered a vegetable dish that was very disappointing you could hardly see vegetables. everything is fluffy, none substance."
"we went there last night for my 61st birthday after reading the good reviews on this site. we booked for and arrived at 1900. by 2100 we had shared 2 very small portions (like 3 bites per person) and one bread roll. the food was interesting, but perhaps the two courses we ate were trying to be interesting rather than necessarily delicious. after searching the floor to finally find one of the two waitpersons, i told him we had eaten 2 very small dishes in 2 hours and it was too slow. he did not respond as far as i could see. we waited another 10 minutes, and then got up to go, just as our fish main course was coming out of the kitchen. at that (late) moment, the waiter offered us the meal without charge and tried to make amends, saying it was a new menu this week and therefore slow. but we were fed up (or not !) and did not feel like staying after thi "
"i want to review this place in all fairness so let me start by saying i had a very nice pasta meal at this restaurant. then i ordered a take away pizza and the cheese was a bit salty; definitely not the mozzarella which is traditionally used for most real italian pizza. i went in for another take away pizza and asked them if they could use mozzarella; the owner informed me all pizza is made with gouda 48+ cheese and that they’ve been doing it for 40 years. that put me off. if you don’t care about truly traditional authentic italian pizza i guess it’s ok as a dutch cheese pie dish but for me it’s a big no no, especially as on its website the restaurant claims to serve authentic/traditional italian cuisine. obviously, dutch gouda cheese is not used in authentic italian cuisine as far as i know."
"we heard there was glutenvrij opties here. so we headed over there, around 5p. well, the food took over an hour to come out and if we didnt ask where our food was, we would still be waiting. i feel they overbooked and could not handle all the orders that night. they definitely forgot about us, my two young daughters were starving, not nice. i had to find a waiter for drinks, unreal. anyway, the food eventually came out. i had a glutenvrij pizza. it was absolutely horrific! just being honest. i usually eat or finish anything that is put in front of me. but this is the first time in my life, that i could not even come close to finishing a dinner. it tasted so horrific, and overwhelmingly salty, i couldnt believe they actually brought this out. it was like a salt pizza. i was so embarrassed for them and couldnt bare to tell them. i know we complained and they did something for us, maybe we didnt pay, dont remember. this occurred last year sometime. i will never go back. my wifes food was just not the best either. not a good night out."
"we were both disappointed. nothing felt like it has just been made. everything had the taste and texture of bought food heated and plated. the cheese sauce was awful; sorry, but it was. the soup was definitely more put together than made, and soup isnt difficult. we would not go there again."
i heard good opinions but found myself disappointed. we ordered focaccia e pane - we got regular bread /not a focacc 
"i got the mixed grill. the chicken and the shredded (shawarma) pork were good. i don’t care for the large servings of fries that seem to accompany most of the local meals. i didn’t care for the sides that came with my order. i’d pass on ordering the pork skewer again. no english menu available, but staff was friendly, helpful, attentive and accommodating to my nut allergy. "
"highly rated but when we were there it was very disappointing. waiting times were long and food was not of the highest quality. when this was mentioned to the waitress, she felt sorry for us but that was it..."
"service: to slow.  blond waitress: unfriendly, distant, shy.  waiters dont even look or ask if customers need anything."
"restaurant was full, even after people left new people came in to take their table ! good sign, righ "
"this spot isnt my favorite and ive visited at least three times. unfortunately, the first time was ok, and the remainder of times were not good...too greasy, meat was hard to eat and i smelled of grease/oil when i lef "
this is not a japanese restaurant. it is only chinese. very disappointing. i did not like the chinese food. it is all the same but prepared different. not very creative.
"men and my boyfriend visited this restaurant do some lunch. the lunch menu seemed very big with nice choices so we were impressed. we both order the tacos. we waited a long time for them. when they arrived they were awful. they were not tacos. they were tiny wraps, with a small.cold amount of beef, tiny veggies and a dollop of sauce. 2 bites and one was gome. for 5.50 euro it was an absolute rip off. cold and tiny food. we paid and then went and got some spring rolls from a different place. we would never go back to this restaurant"
"we went there to have a quick lunch and we got some delicious sandwiches with chicken, salmon and hamburgers: very deliciou "
"we had a good diner here. i ate the saté, a typical dutch meal which was no more than 11,80 euro. you get fries with that and a little salad. but the salad tasted very dry, also because there was no kind of dressing on it. overalj it was still good though. with the coffee i got a lot of chocolate which was a very positive point. for the children there are smaller menus for a reasonable price."
i would have liked to give this place more stars but the service was just too subpar. the tornadoes was on par with other places in holland but their pork skewers were a real let down. i was not a fan of the sauce it was very grimy and almost had a hint of coffee to i 
year after year the same menu. french fries could be better. service is very variable with ups and downs prices are above average.
"weve asked to get a table with a dog and have been told the kitchen is closed , while other guests still came i "
"the other reviews suggested this would be a great restaurant in the vicinity but in our experience it was really not that great. the price shouldve warned me; 3 courses for 24,95 is a great deal; too good to be true. however i didnt realize this is the only dinner option they offered, so i share it here. let me start by staying the restaurant looks nice, the beers are great and the staff is very friendly. coming to the food however; the mozzarella at the caprese starter wasnt very tasty (and thats the main ingredient), the veggies and black angus steak tasted somewhat burned (even though it wasnt visibly burned) and the creme brulé was soft and mushy. for the price, it was ok, but with 4.5 stars on tripadvisor and compared to our dinner the evening before at den engel this one left is disappointed."
"friendly service, but otherwise absolute rubbish. the food was poor and we waited 2 hours from starter to main course!"
"we had the black angus burger, the patty was to thin and dry and there was no sauce on it, the portion size and the fries were good though. the view was really good and the service was alright. but for 18,50 the birger should be way better."
"perfect location for a nice dinner. went here (without reservation) on a friday evening in the middle of the season. the place was not full (yet) but a lot of tables reserved. the establishment is pretty new also. the menu is not very extensive, makes sense as they have to handle (in peaks) huge amounts of people. pricing is mediocre-high, due to the location. we ordered a soup as a starter, quite a big bowl with some bread-rolls. very tasty, dish of the week was mussels with chips (ordered bread instead) and the other main was a chicken satay skewer with fries. food came in pretty fast, was tasty good and well portions. special remark for the salty butter that came with the bread. service in this place is kind of weird. once you enter the place it (always somehow) takes a little time before they get you seated. they are friendly but kind of fake dont know how to pronounce that. nothing wrong, just weird. also after we had our food (1st and 2nd course) and they took away our plates no-one ever asked us if we wanted a dessert, coffee or tea. although they walked past us numerous times. odd... anyway, for good food and some relaxing time near a beautiful beach-location you obviously cant go wrong here. but do not forget: it is not a restaurant, it is a beach club with good food and great ambiance."
"five employees were taking to each other at the bar, yet no one really seemed to notice i was there. the food tasted good, but seemed a bit wee for the money (€6,25)."
setting is lovely and staff are friendly and professional. but the food promises more than it delivers. homemade lemonade wasnt and a caesar salad had no chicken at all and a very anchovy heavy mayonnaise dressing. its a shame as the potential is huge. maybe we caught them on an off day? 
"the location is nice and the menu looks good. however, the taste is a bit bland and uninspiring. we had a fine main course but especially the starter and dessert we just less then we expected for the price we paid. the staff is very kind and pleasant. the good service compensates the food which is why we give it 3 stars. "
we called in here whilst exploring the area. the establishment was busy with a constant flow of customers
"habe been to this place before and wanted to have dinner hier with 6 friends. we arrived at 21h15m and we were refused to come in once we were too late. i called 40 minutes before and i was informed would close at 22h. too bad, i will never come back and i will never recommend this place to anyone."
"walked in for late lunch, sat d "
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
plenty parking space around the restaurant. very nice old fashioned furniture.cosy ambiance. food is o.k. very small wine-list. prices are surprising .reasonable. very friendly service.
"we visited this restaurant this weekend. we decided late so where late with booking the table (same day). it took a while before we where welcomed by ever so sweet but very inexperienced girl. it was her first day so she told us. we had a table up stairs next to a window, it was very cold that day with freezing winds which literately came through the widow. it is an old building therefore not easily heated i imagine. we requested to change tables and this was no problem. we where served by an extremely friendly spanish waiter who clearly was there for the wines as this where he excelled in. i believe they where severely understaffed that night and this resulted in some errors on this front. we got offered a glass of wine on the house to compensate. i had some very nice pata negra as starter which was very nice, the accompanying selection of three kinds of bread with its toppings where well found. main course was a dry aged entrecote which i found a bit blend, even with the aged madera saus the taste was not very outspoken. as postre we had the selection of cheeses which where to cold and therefore lacked taste a bit. overall i think we where their on a difficult night for them and i do see its potential and where they are striving towards. i will return on day for a do over."
1714 have a very pleasant terrace on a barge in the canal. service was friendly and fairly quick. they could not do cake with the cappuccino but suggested a dessert instead. this was tasty but very small compared to a piece of cake and a lot more expensive. overall still a good experience.
"lovely staff and a very nice atmosphere but lacking an edge, the food is very typically dutch and im starting to think there must be one big training camp somewhere in the netherlands that are churning out a nation of brain dead chefs who have zero inspiration all following the same guidelines.... the food nice but thats it, its just nic "
"the main reason you should eat here is the location. beautiful mill, nicely situate "
"dont get me wrong...its a fine restaurant, great tastes, beautifully served  clean and well decorated....but way overpriced..."
great views in schiedam  perfect for an idyllic evening with drinks and food.   asian satay was fairly good. chicken was cooked very well and the salads were fresh.   tepanade for starters were just moderate.
we had various meals in our group. the gambas were very average. the sate ok and the simmertal meat could have been far more tender. with a few mistakes on the bill i would say average.
"nice ambience. lightening too bright. very tastefull starter (fish duo) moderate main course (tenderloin tips w. pepper sauce), but tasty fries w. mayonnaise served. very friendly though busy service."
"nice and helpful staff. both inside as outside comfortable, correct priced eating. food was nicely presented. fish quite good on a heap of mixed vegetables (iffy), sate ok but smaller pieces would have been appreciated."
"the restaurant has a nice terrace in the historic centre of schiedam. the facilities and meal is somewhat standard, good but nothing special. the waiters are not all of the same level, the young guy helping outside however was good and did a good job"
"this restaurant is on the corner of a historic market square. we visited during a local festival which was not a good thing because the menu was adapted, wine served in plastic cups and there was a line up of visitors from outside waiting at the restrooms. but the food was ok and the service was friendly. somehow it seems that the restaurant, decorated with moroccan lamps and platters fixed to the walls. is not making the most of its historic location."
hey everyo 
each round of our order is incomplete. they served late and sad thing they do not served what we ordered. and kept ignoring us! will complain to the proper authorities. we are pax of 4!! we paid 130€. i will not recommend this restaurant. bloody cheater!!!!!
"we went to zuma sushi for lunch. the cost was good and the sushi was the best i have had in the netherlands. the service could be better, more attentive, and i can imagine the frustration in the evening when its busy by people visiting this restaurant being that the service is a bit on the slow side. we had two different servers. the one was very quiet however the other one was very friendly."
"i unfortunately left very unhappy. the food is okay, the location itself is stunning from the outside but a bit cheap decorated on the insid "
"i visied this restaurant with my sisters and our kids for a drink and warm snacks after the theater. the drinks arrived and after 30 minutes waiting no snacks. the place was almost empty. when i enquired i was told that the waitress had forgotten our order. her colleague apologized on her behalf, she didnt bother to show her face. we wont go back."
this restaurant is situated in the historic old city hall of schiedam. nice variety of food and wine. the service is a bit slow and the food is average. the room and the atmosphere are great. nice for weekends lunch.
"my very first chinese restaurant in the netherlands and the first impression is good. the food was quite decent and tasted authentic, given that ive been to many restaurants in hong kong and taiwan. the restaurant itself is quite big but was relatively empty during the day. mind you, it was quite a cold day with ice on the road, which might explain it. the lighting in the restaurant is a dim so i found it slightly difficult to see the food clearly. adding a lazy susan to the table wouldve made sharing the dishes much easier. otherwise, the food tasted quite authentic."
"going to a chinese restaurant or getting chinese food from the take-away, which is almost always attached to the restaurant is sort of a habit in the netherlands. free parking is also nice with the colossal hourly rates in the city center parking facilities. that is why i try from time to time chinese restaurants in the suburbs to find the kind of chinese restaurant i will gladly return to. however, chinese restaurant rose garden was no revelation. granted, parking was free in the street and the staff was welcoming and polite, albeit a bit slow. the restaurant is clean and light, but a discordant was the slot machine in full view, complete with gamblers. furthermore, a table at the window means a view of a filling station and the multilevel car park next to the spaland shopping center. the food was obviously prepared with dedication, but, in my opinion, too much cooking oil was used for the preparation. i must admit that i am spoiled through my numerous visit to malaysia, but i cant write an enthusiastic review about the food served at the rose garden. it is average at best. so i am still searching for that special chinese restaurant, where you can say when the thought strikes you: lets go tonight."
"but the home delivered food was substandard. vegetarian foo yong egg without a trace of vegetables and mushrooms, beaten and fried egg only, and babi kecap with a sauce not even remotely associated with kecap was the score. usually the portions of a home delivery of chinese food are that large, that the leftovers, put in the fridge, can be made into a substantial tasty lunch next day with help of the microwave, but this time the leftovers were relegated to the dust bin. what had happened in the kitchen of woo ping i will never know, but they can do much better, noticing that restaurant is a steady value in schiedam for many years."

came here for a business lunch. the buffet offers a good asian style buffet with a grill to prepare stir fry and also has some typical dutch favorites offered.
"we were kicked out before i could finish my drink (or pay extra time) the place was practically empty at that time so i didn’t think it’d be a big deal to relax and finish my drink. it ruined the mood. friendly and helpful staff though, but rule doesn’t work for me. i wouldn’t return."
"we’ve been talking about this restaurant several years, finally we’ve visited this restaurant a few weeks ago. the setting of the restaurant is superb, in a quiet green surrounding, almost in the middle of nowhere… as aperitif we had ruinard, one of my favourites, with nicely presented appetizers, a nice start! then my scallops arrived, the first preparation was superb, the second (warm) was overcooked. also my langoustine as second course, first preparation tastes good, second overcooked again. pigeon as main course, could have be tasteful, if it wouldn’t be too salty and overcooked yet again. and to finish a dessert based on blood orange which gave the impression of lack of inspiration… very classic and too heavy me "
25 euro for all you can eat. chefs will prepare special dishes for you. ready food is not allways full which is little bit dissapointing. there is a lot of seats in this restaurant so you will allways get a table. ice creams are really nice. overall 7/10 -3 because food in not allways full

let’s start with the go 
welcomed at the door we were taken through to the lounge overlooking the water. we were offered a special moet et chandon. some delicious bites were served including an impressive kroepoek snack with great tast 
"the restaurants interior feels like a hotel. not really nice decorated, certainly not up to date. the food is ok but certainly not 2 michelin stars worthy. it seems michelin holland is not as strict. compare this to any 2 stars in belgium, france, spain and you will be disappointed. maybe its trendy go give a raw carrot, cowlyflower etc... as amuse, this is not what i want in a 2 star restaurant. the food was also to rich, heavy, totally not my style. the quality was certainly not bad, just not refined enough."
"nothing outstanding about the greek food here -- it was a tad greasy and disappointing. the serving size was large -- but frankly, id prefer smaller portions and better quality. the restaurant was noisy and busy, and the waitstaff were initially brusque but warmed up and became friendlier as the evening progressed."
this greek restaurant was a real disappointme

there was only tapas and you can choose from 6p different bits of tapas. in total 14 for euro 4 
the scenery in the restaurant and on the terrace is very nice. the staff is friendly and accurate. the menu gives a variety of both dutch and international dishes. the winelist is simpel but effective. the price for a simple houswine is over the top.
"to be a host to visitors in this beautiful, iconic village on a sunny day, must be such a privilege. we cycled to find ourselves drawn to this hostelry and entered with anticipation. however, it was so very disappointing to find that, although whilst trying to speak dutch, we were met with disdain. even when we left, it felt as if the staff were looking down on us as we paid…..and we ended up leaving them a generous tip. how did that happen?"
we had a family and friends meal here during our recent visit to the ar 
"good food, pleasant waitress but snobbish manager. too bad!! wont go back anymo "
to start with the positive things: the kitchen is really good! 
"on a friday night me and some friends went to baarssen for some fish. all three of us ordered the kibbeling plate. it was served on a big fish-shaped plate and served with some french fries, a salad, a small piece of bread and a little bit of russian salad with fish. the taste of the food was as expected, the fish a bit greasy but with a nice crispy crust. the salad was fresh. the waitress seemed a little shy but was friendly. overall, i would recommend this place for a quick and simple dinner/ or a snack in the afternoon. "
"were a family of dutch australians visiting the netherlands and travelled to urk to discover the area. we parked outside baarssen looking for somewhere to have coffee and lunch. we chose a nice window table for 5 and the brunette waitress who served us seemed nice enough until we asked for camomile tea. no idea what were asking for (we spoke mainly dutch but with english also) and returned with a tea chest and said this is what we have and walked off. for 45 minutes after our coffee order came we waited (a) for our coffee dishes to be cleared and (b) for the waitress to take our order. when she was approached (we went to her) that we wanted to order lunch (at this stage the cafe was starting to get busy), she said that she would get to us when she was ready. she continued to ignore our table but took orders from tables around us. weve never experienced such bad service in a cafe before. coffee and apple gebak that we had was nice but was marred by this waitresses lack of professionalism. we do not intend on visiting this place again. unimpressed!!😡"
"this is essentially a great fish shop with a small cafe area for meals. looks like it does a big trade with tourists and campers who pack the harbor town centre. was in urk a couple of times this trip and each time enjoyed watching my fresh salted raw herring being prepared by an expert. add chopped onions, tip your head back, bite and within seconds you are dutch! outdoor and indoor seating for snackers and a small dining room for lunch and dinner (only early evening)."
"the restaurant was pretty empty, but still the service was slow.  we actually had to ask for our main dish and then the order was wrong on top of it."
"we were waiting there for more than 15’ for the waitress to come and take the order when the order came, it was wrong! don’t waste your time and money here"
"the restaurant offered special meals at a reduced rate for coupons given out by a supermarket chain. we, a party of 4, tried this because reviews were ok. the menu had a lot of lyrical descriptions about the food, and based on those descriptions we expected fairly special courses. this turned out to be disappointing. appetizers were nothing special. the fish for the main course was deep-fried and very greasy and my rib roast turned out to be a pork chop (not described as such on the menu!) that was a bit overcooked and fairly dry. dessert choice was icecream with or without fruit (which turned out to be canned fruit). too bad, since we shall not readily return. in my opinion there is no excuse to serve poor quality, even at discount rates. service was swift and friendly but, evidently, untrained (our waitress did not recognize the type of fish). the view over the lake is very nice."
"small nice friendly bistro in a small town, beautiful sight through the window and terrace. friendly and helpful service, not expensive compared to some other bistro/ cafe. enjoined the stay and drinks"
food is very bad. im sorry to say this. but it was cold. and we must wait much to long for it. to many people the cant handle it anymore. the young girls work very hard and do the best they can. it was also to expensive. dont go to this place. it look nice but it ducks. i think the boss is sitting in his house on the bahamas and let the people do the work. no body cares whats happening in side the restaurant. dear toerist people. go to a little vis snackbar. there you have so much more for your money. goodbye i hope i never see you again.
"although the food and service were just average and a bit expensive for tourists like me, the view was well worth it."
even if you just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the view...its worth the long drive from amsterdam.
"my husband, our daughter, my sister and i went to this restaurant for cup of coffee after a walk in the town. the place was so warm, the view amazing, but the waitress not welcome at all. she just didnt want to speak english to us!only for this reason i will give less stars. otherwise the service was fast. "
"me and my girlfriend went for diner to this restaurant a saturday evening. the weather was nice, but we decided to eat inside. the view from the inside to the ijsselmeer is just as lovely as from the terrace, they paid attention to make sure nothing blocks the sight. many people strolling by on the boulevard, which makes it never boring. a lot of german tourists were around, perhaps they had holid "
driving around through the polder i decided to eat an early dinner in urk. i landed at the kaap near the lighthouse and went to this fish restaurant with view to the lake/sea si 
"on a great spot in this authentic village youll find this fish restaurant.  worth the money. super fresh! the way they cook, not my style, but it is not bad ! as i said super fresh ! and plenty. just visit."
"admitting that i visited this restaurant in my pre-tripadvisor life i was reminded by the absolute terrible way we got treated at this restaurant. everything that could go wrong, went wron "
"we ended up at this place only to get a coffee (and to use the loo, which i must be honest is a very good service provided by the restaurant to the community and visitors, since you do not need to enter the main place to make use of it) and we sort of had almost the full deal. service was fast, polite and efficient. the view to the sea bank outstanding. it’s definitely worth coming and enjoy the place with a bit more calm than we did"
"we waited more than an hour for our food, then followed up with the waiter only to find out that our food order wasnt placed.  when the food eventually arrived, it wasnt even what we ordered.  really bad experience."
"the view was indeed wonderful, but the service poor. we were with a party of five which included four adults and one child. first of all we had to wait an hour for our food to come. we had ordered pretty soon after we arrived and after we got our drinks had to wait an hour for our main course. the soup which belonged to a menu did come quick, but only two of us ordered a menu so the rest of us was waiting. in the mean time we were asked if we wanted more to drink by at least two different people. this is nice, but it would have been better if the two different servers would talk to eachother so they would know that this question had already been aske "
we had not been to urk for many years and decided to revisit urk and enjoy a good fish dinner which should be easy considering that urk is a fishing to 
"de stroom has been a water pumping station for city ulitities. to my great pleasure, in recent years a trend has evolved that such buildings while no longer in use for their industrial/utility purpose, are being safegarded from destruction by finding new functions. here, the cafe-restaurant is the major new function. the exploiter offers a choice of good foods, some biological some i am not sure, for very fair prices. the menus are not exclusive but the fair price makes this an nice place to eat with a family."
we enjoyed some food and drinks in the afternoon sun..  the food was pretty good but the portions were much smaller than the prices
25 euros for a couple of welcome cava’s 
"not that exciting, service was not too good for this price and staying outside for a drink was not an option, the terrace was almost empty!!! hate it when there is no flexibility. the food was for this price average and the service too. the wine was ok, but altogether it was an average experienc "
"trendy place, nice interior and decent location ... but some quality details made it for me rather average nouvelle cuisine. service can be better, given the price tag you finally pay for these kind of restaurants. and im used to eat from the best brasseries in town till michelin* starred restaurants. not bad, it needs extra attention."
i was invited by a friend to this restaurant which has a great ambiance and good service. however this quality was destroyed by a worm in my fish on the service plate. i guess this was one of the worst experience of my life even this may not be restaurants fault. even the waitress took care of this immediately they did not do anything ekstra for the apology except a free coffee. they could do more for this kind of scandal which will be one of my worst memory...
"nice location in a former pumping station, good food, but very overpriced. one waitress was very accommodating and friendly, the others were distant and cold. we had to wait while one of them put our coats away before we were seated, which took a long time. food was good, but looked better than it tasted. found the whole place rather pretentious and would not likely return."
"definitely not worth a part from the nice furniture, decoration of the interior and exterior sort of church on the si "
"portions too small. owner not friendly, she couldnt even tell me what the dessert was, she only said...its sweet. the cheese tray was small and no explanation as to what cheeses."

"had a simple dinner at this greek restaurant which has good food for low prices. it’s really a old fashioned greek restaurant with nothing special but accurate service. they serve traditional greek food, lots of meat but tasteful. don’t expect a classy place but somewhere where you can go with big groups. "
i had a lovely dinner with a friend in the olympi 
we had diner in this restaurant and we took the 3 courses surprise menu. even if everything was freshly cooked we didn’t find it special. we took the wine pairing and it was a good match with the plates. but we were actually disappointed by the experience. 
"i visited with 3 business associates, we all took the 4 course surprise menu. presentation was ok-ish, nothing special. the taste was quite disappointing. starter base was poached salmon, accompanied by a.o. some wild mushrooms and razor clams, all pretty tasteless. fish course was sea bass which was good, but the accompanying bulgar cooked in saffran was overpowering for the fish. main couse was beef (2 ways) with ratatouille, beef was ok, ratatouille was excellent. madiera sauce was not great. dessert with a cherry base had some red wine vinegar accompaniment which in my opinion was too sharp and did not work. my collegues took the wine accompaniment which they said was good."
the restaurant its absolutely nice to sit its a bit loud inside but nevertheless its a cosy environment. serving is done at a very friendly level. you can say this is a reference for a lot of place 
"beautifull interiour, modern, food average, to noisy, stairs going up and down with people, service good but to busy and very little personal attention."
"we decided to have our christmas dinner at restaurant de olifant in breukelen. we searched for multiple venues in the region and went with de olifant after having read the positive reviews online, despite the fact that it was on the more expensive end of the set we looked  "
"we went to this place because it was mentioned that they cook italian cuisine. the place is nice, the surrounding is beautiful (at the river vecht), the service was fine. however, the food was ok, it only reminds me far away what the taste would have been if the restaurant was located in italy. making italian food with a dutch swing, is a pity."
"i have eaten here before and it was lovely, not this time. we went for the shared dining and had a discount as well, maybe that is why. the bread and dips were great. the starter had good variation. there were mussels, cooked too long and calimari that were way too salty. there was a tomato salad with no flavor at all, but the piece of smoked mozzerlla was divine. the sauteed mushrooms were very nice. the rest of the table had some ham and vitello tonato(made with fricandau instead of veal) but i have a pork allergy, so i had a bruschetta with carpaccio, very tasty. it took a long time for the nect course to come and drinks were not refreshed. when the main course arrived, we were given the wine menu, as asked for. the cod and risotto was quite good, but the other course was pork and vegetables. i got some vegetables, and the sauce was so salty, it was inedible. the wine order was not taken. finally, after another long wait, dessert, again lots of choice. some ice-cream, nothing wrong with that. tje creme brulee and tiramisu were extremely bland. the chocolate mousse was nice, and the topping on the panna cotta was superb, but the basis tasted only of sweet. another long wait for the coffee, one of us received a cappuccino imstead of a latte and none of the coffee was very good. i really hope this was just a bad day, and not an indication that the quality is declining. "
"location is superb. ample parking. food sizes are european and more than enough when you dont want to overeat. service was friendly. tastes were fine. desert was to die for. and then again... this could be so much better if someone with knowledge of interior decoration could do over this place. the colors on the wall, floors, furniture, signs, lighting fixtures, curtain rails, bathrooms, ... it is eclectic and not warm. missed opportunity to make the look and feel of the place in sync with the aspiration on the culinary field and service. this makes the price/quality poor."
"while on a visit to our daughter, in breukelen, we dined at de olifant. what a disappointme "
"booked the restaurant to catch up with someone and had hoped for nice weather so we could have drinks and dinner on the terrace on the vegt. unfortunately, rain so we sat in the conservatory, which was also fine. the hostess came by every 10 minutes with the same question, have you already made a choice?. it was still quite early, and we were still enjoying our drinks and kept indicating this. it was a bit irritating and at the same time also funny. we finally chose a four-course menu with cheese for dessert. each course was delicious and beautifully prepared. the lobster bisque had a good taste. also, during dinner, our hostess was irritatingly present by constantly wanting to sell glasses of wine. the location definitely gets a 10, and the dishes are well flavored and very tasty. the service staff, on the other hand, needs a refresher course in hospitality."
"everything is superb except the guest friendliness. that is why 3 stars, sorry, but costumer service is very important."
"beautiful location. the food is okay but not special. value for money is insufficient, ( 2pax, three course, 150 euro)the bill was incorrect, we had to mention it. and even after we left, we found out they still charged the tasting menu to high. vibes are a bit arrogant."
"we had a family gathering at this restaurant and were thrilled with the setting which is right by the river so outdoor dining was possible in the gorgeous weather. the service was excellent with professional and friendly staff. it suited us for the occasion for it to be slow which indeed it was. we were there for over four hours for a three course meal. the food itself was excellently prepared and cooked but unfortunately, the helpings were so small we felt the a la carte courses provided were more like a tasting menu. very disappointing considering the high cost. if the owners would just be a bit more generous with their vegetables, accompaniments i would be happy to return. the cheesboard contained four tiny pieces of cheese and one tiny slice of bread. wine started at around 28 euros a bottle and the wines we chose were excellent."
"after visiting mos in amsterdam we new it would be hard to beat, and werent wrong. we went for the taster menu and unfortunately it was a real let do "
the service was so terrible !! we ate all bread and still waiting for the food ! the waitress did not have any idea what were the ingredients... never again..
"we had diner here on a sunny evening in august, arrived by boat, parked in front of slangevegt. restaurant looks very nice, location and view is spetacular. we had a lovely table outside next tothe river. nice staff, food was nothing special, in fact we were somewhat dissapointed, very plain taste. recommended on sunny days only."
"we had dinner there this week. we started with 2 glasses of cava. we both had the slangevegt dinner menu of € 37,50 a person. it was the lobster bisque, the iberico pig, and the ice-cream with mango. the bisque was served in a champagne glass with cold foam on top. it was very salty, too salty to finish. the piece of iberico pig that my partner had was almost half fats. the ice-cream was nice. the service could be better for a place like this. we had to wait long before we were given the menu and received the menu after we had already finished our cava. i had a wine suggestion with the first 2 courses. while not having finished my first wine yet, the second was poored and the unemptied glass of white wine was taken aw "
"we had a group dinner here. the style of food was cuisine, nicely presented meals and a nice ambience in the restaurant. on site parking was convenient and the service was quite good. there was not a lot of choice in the menu and although the food was nice, i expected better for the prices we paid. would try again for lunch to see if experience is better without a large group on a busy night as it is a nice location."
"this place is all about the location - its pretty and if the sun is shining you can sit by the river watching the boats go by, a beautiful way to spend an eveni "
very nice location in one of the most expensive area of the netherla 
"we had dinner at slangevegt with a party of four. the restaurant breaths a cosy atmosphere and we were guided to the back of the restaurant where we were seated at the window overlooking the terrace and vecht river. after having an aperitif (we were not offered any hors douvres) we had a starter - i myself had lobster bisque which was served with a scallop - which was good and after that a combination of iberico pig and gambas which was even better. a pity that one of us missed forks and the other knives when the starter came. also, nobody bothered to bring the wine menu so when the starter came, we didnt have anything to drink. then, we ordered a dessert - i had cheese - that took extremely long to arrive. the waiter apologised by offering a free glass of porto which was a nice gesture. anyway, all in all a couple of service flaws but then again, good food and a nice venue. could be a very good but at the moment, slangevegt does not reach that score..."
"the service at this place was terrible. we reserved tables for 21 people, we were assigned 1 young waitress and it took the 2 hours to serve the first course of the 4-course menu."
"i have been going to slangevegt for over 3 years, mostly business but occasionally for pleasure. i always come away feeling like a person whose lover is beautiful but just gives enough to keep you coming back. i just dont feel the love. service overall is not bad but for crying out loud, a menu within 10 minutes wouldnt hurt. the staff are generally very pleasant but need to connect more often with the table- seems i need to ask for service instead of the other way around at times. the food is tasty but overpriced. like many aspiring dutch restaurants it tries too hard on presentation and form rather than taste and value. stop making a show and serve decent portions for main courses. i am not paying for cuckoo spit. you would starve without the appetizer so you will need to order both starter and main course to stave off your hunger. food is very good overall- i just think they should serve more simple quality and manly portions in a timely manner. i expect much more for what i pay but no taking away that this remains a unique restaurant in a beautiful location . like a lover however, no matter how beautiful, you need to start giving something more to keep me hanging on. "
"slangevegt is always a good place to eat or relax at the terrace on the riverside. unfortunetaly the service is very bad. the waiters act like they are the costumer instead of you. thats a pity because the whole formula is great, so i hope there will be some progression made in the service level during thiswinter. when i come back next spring i might reconsider this review."
"keep going back as i love the location and hope each time things will get better with regards to food and service, but no still a big let down. the service is so slow for a 7.30pm booking we still did not get the main course till nearly 10pm, prices are really high for what they serve and the scallops were most definitely frozen not fresh. what ever i say people will still go there because the position on the side of the river and the ambiance is lovely, they just need to tighten up there act. still would reccomend just dont expect value for money or be too hungry!"
this restaurant is in the towns center located along a busy street. the price quality ratio is good. staff is friendly. interior is a bit dark.
"really bad vegetarian dinner served when i asked specially for a vegan dinner, so i was unable to eat any of it, unfortunstely it was christmas at my sister in laws, it was very embarassing for her, also the fish dish had bones in it, and the ragout dish twigs, the bread and dessert cakes were shop bought and not cooked by the chef, who had promised me a vegan meal, mymeal contained cheese and eggs in nearly every course. very upsetting. the meals wer orderd on line at least a week in advance so there is no excuse for this."
"we were 4 for dinner. all four steaks was cold and raw, ive never paid for somthing like this, but no one in charge could take responsibility  never again"
centrally located in breukelen this restaurant counts with friendly service and a good standard dutch kitchen. you can choose daily menu or a la carte and the accomodation is cozy between a restaurant eetcafe part and a covered veranda part. nicely serve some snacks with the drinks and recommend are the saté and black angus! among the deserts the strawberries with whipped cream and spekkoek (typical indinesian pie) are suggested! 
"the food is bad and priced way too high, the service is poor and on top of that the owner visibly flirts with practicality every woman (whether they are alone or with their partner) that sets foot in their restaurant whilst his thai wife yells at their own staff and treats them very bad. she must have forgotten where she came from. the only positive thing is the location."
"not good experience: slow, unhelpful service; pricy; keen to see us go even though a couple of hours before closing. lots of nicer places nearby"
"stopped for lunch with the family. situated in a large, high ceiling, recent building which also hosts an art gallery, the setting is interesting. the menu is a quite extensive list of thai dishes but which are not cheap : lunch dishes around 15 euros and dinner dishes around 25 euros. so when the dishes came, i was a little disappointed : a washed down version of bankgok street food. not bad, but nothing to die for. service is very friendly and smily albeit a little slow. if you have never been to thailand, it will give you an introduction but otherwise just enjoy the setting."
"worst dinning experience ever!! 90 minute wait on entrees, horrible service, mediocre food, they do take credit cards.......do not waste your time"
"who knows if the food is good, well never find out. we were on a very nice bike ride last saturday, a beautiful day. we saw this lovely terrace so we parked our bikes and asked if it would be alright if we had something to drink and maybe something simple, not a full dinner and that we would only be there about 20-30 minutes. it was 5:15, not exactly rush hour for dinner and they had many tables open. one woman refused to answer us so we asked another and he said we could. he (and one other wait person) then proceeded to actively avoid us! walking right by and never giving us a glance. they werent busy or rushed or understaffed. perhaps because we werent locals or dutch? (if that was the case this was the first time that ever happened). they were so obvious about it that we could not even get their attention. after 10-15 minutes, we just got us and left. the interesting thing was i was thinking about going there another time with a friend who lives in the area. but not now. maybe the food is great, but there is no reason for service like this, especially because we asked if it would be ok if we did not order dinner. we left pissed and thirsty!"
"we were with my boyfriend for one night(luckily) in room 206. what we noticed was that the first impression was pretty bad. we were greeted by the receptionists and when my bf asked bout the parking, they said they were going to explain later(why not immediately?), but eventually they didn’t, so we had to ask twice. we entered the room and the bathroom was fairly dirty(see the attached photos), surely not bleached for weeks. the staff seemed unprepared spilling drinks and coming without a menu card. the dinner was simple and there was little choice and the dessert for two which was something like brownie was too little for two people. long story short, not the top notch service you’d expect from a place and price like this."
"fairly priced restaurant. quite big, still feels cosy. menu for set course (comes with hotel) is simplistic. also à la carte has nothing good, nothing bad. nothing wrong with being average!"
"we sat with 4 people for dinner which was okay. three of the meals were good, one drink on the second round was forgotten twice and after three main courses were brought the fourth took another 15 minutes, by which time the schnitzel seemed dry. staff were friendly but the place seemed to be poorly managed. almost what you would expect from a food shed, not what we expected here. doubt i will be back here and will think twice about any of the other chain restaurants. "
"this place pays €3,50 an hour to its 16 year old waitresses and in the case of my daughter when she finally left, kept the cash deposit she was forced to pay for the uniform even after she returned it. so she was diddled out of 10 hours of earnings. not a place to visit if you value fair working conditions."
grumpy waitress and the food was the worst van der valk restaurant ever! dinner of daughter was so tasteless we ordered another meal but it was not much better. arriving at home severe stomach ache and had to go to the toilet constantly. not a great experience!
"came here for a business meeting, place has a warm feeling, helpful staff, reasonably good cuisine. feels like a quiet refuge in the midst of the otherwise dull landscape of wetlands with geese, ducks and swans reigning the area."
in was a trip down memory lane. as if time did not move the last 30 years in this restaurant. the menu is classic but the dishes are poorly executed. there is no surprise including the iconic applesauce with a cherry. positive was the serving staff who was very alert and friendly.
"had some fries with chicken and satay sauce. i missed the acar (in dutch: atjar), which is traditionally served with this dish. the portions were rather small. therefore, i believe the prices are slightly unjustified. moreover, i had some gin & tonic drinks, which were proper tasteful."
the hot 
the formula of van der valk is renowned in holland. much food for reasonable pric 
"pleasent reception, clean rooms,uncomfertable bedding, adequate restaurant,  but seriously: no pasta? breakfast not included, good average."
"had a quick sunday afternoon drink with some family. to say that the service was poor was an understatement despite plenty of staff walking around. had to ask for drinks and for finger food, almost begging. drinks and food fine, service not"
"we ate at van der valk out on the terrace. food as you can expect was good quality. service was rather slow and clumsy at some stage. later back in the bar, excellent and friendly service."
"service is excellent, the interior pleasant, the wines descent and the meat good but everything else (with the exception of the salad and apple compote) was either cold or too buttery without any flavor. the mashed potatoes, fried potatoes, cabbage, fried vegetables were awfull. have been in this restaurant before so i know they can do better but the cooks had an off day im afraid. "
"great location (a2 between amsterdam and utrecht), excellent to have a business meeting, poor service, good coffee."
"ive eaten twice at the restaurant...once out of curiosity and the second time due to everything else being closed (time, holiday, etc). both times i wasnt happy with the food, the chicken was quite dry and stale, whilst the satay sauce was almost at a jelly like consistenc "
"really nice location, with normal but good food. the menu has the standard meals like carpaccio, soup, steak, safe and salmon. service is really nice. they were extremely quick with drinks, starter and dessert but for the main course we had to wait longer which was hard for the kids as they were hungry."
"food was good but we had to wait so long, also between courses. after 2 visits which had similar experience we will not go again. shame as the staff were friendly"

"had a valentines dinner here in feb 2015; staff was very friendly, and even decorated the table for me and my wife! food was what you can expect from a tapas place, its tasty, but a bit of an overload in oil/garlic (which is perhaps part of the cuisine?) - but that kind of makes every dish taste very similar! all in all, would certainly come back again due to friendly staff, and the fact that oil and garlic are actually quite tasty. a bit more variety in taste wouldnt hurt though!"
"i went to try the tapas with my husband and since we must work until 8 pm, were a little late for the all you can eat.. but we dont mind to speed up because were so tired too. the bill came up 70 something euros! we ate only a few tapas and it wasnt even meet the standard of tapas on the street of barcelona or malaga.. so dissapointed we will never eat here again! you can never get a second chance for first impression.."
we had the all you can eat tapas option for €20 per person. that is s bit of an overstatement due to the rules and the kitchen slownes

"visiting rijswijk in a cold winter afternoon, i had the chance to sat in this cafe-restaurant. not hungry i asked for a vietnamese lumpia and a beer. nice cold beer, hot lumpia, not really tasty. smiling lady serving."
"we ordered the toast veggie for lunch and the amount was a joke, just one poached egg with 5 thin slices of avocado. we certainly finished the dish in 2 minutes and told the waitress how disappointed we were about the amount, to which she replied that it was meant for breakfast. after having taken a look at the menu, we told her that actually, it was under the lunch menu to which she just replied: ok! if you are still hungry, you can always order something el "
"went here with a group of 15. had to place orders in advance. although last minute changes were made, staff remained friendly and helpful. food was good enough and was served in a timely manner. would go back next time when in rijswijk"
"a restaurant like many others, nice service and average cuisine. the fish of the main course was slightly smelly, the starter was ok. all in all not unforgettable!"
"i am very sorry to say but this time round this place disappointed... first of all, we reserved well in advance but they did not bother to seat us in a good place, but in front of entry door... in the cold weather it was pretty annoying "
"just some pros and cons  pros •	nice terrace in busy street •	excellent wine is available •	service is good •	prices are realistic, not too high  con’s •	food can be a little bit fancy (outdated?)"

"came here during lunch. food was unevenly divided over the group, old lady waitress was rude and as a whole the group of waiters seemed unorganized.as for the food very generic, straight from the freezer to the deep fry."
quick lunch at moshi moshi. we took an all you can eat sushi. quality was fair and service acceptable considering that the restaurant was empty. fair enough.
sushi was not fresh. grumpy service. slow service. not enough variety. expensive with regards to quality. i would avoid.
ive ate in moshi moshi several times and have always been happy with the food. the last visit i had was as part of a big group and the service did suffer a little bit.
this place is a good example with what is wrong with the concept of all-you-can-eat sushi. yes you can pile the sushi plates high and indeed the price is particularly good in relation to the quantity but they have given up completely on the quality and the taste of the food. try a real sushi place once and youll never want togo back there. never aga 
"easy concept, good quality / price, friendly service, a lot of choices, but often the same sauce is used which is a bit pity. easy to go with a group or with kids, or as a couple."
i liked the concept of an all you can eat buffet with the 5 dish at a time ordering that moshi moshi employed. the food was fairly decent and i particularly liked the smoked duck breast. certainly the highlight of my meal.
with this option you get upto 25 dis

only possible to eat order buffet instead of a choice to order a la car 
they hide the drinks menus so you cant see how much they cost. at €2.50 for 20cl water im not surprised! food fine but really rich (presumably to get you to drink more)
i went in moshi-moshi with two friends. given the price the food was of quite good quali 
"i was in moshi moshi with a group of friends. given the price the food was ok. but the service was extremely rude. one waiter has spilled a drink over over our table. he didnt even say sorry and didnt make effort to clean it up. when we wanted to pay by cards, the waiter refused to split up the bill and wanted one person to pay the whole bill (over 250eur)!!! above all, the environment was very loud. we definitely wont go back."
the interior of this place is rather roomy and classy for a greek restaurant. it offers a wide range of menu items that seem more authentic than youd get at the average run-of-the-mill greek in your neighborho 
we took the simple menu consisting of 5 x 5 choices per person. our waitress explained the digital menu in 45 seconds resulting some confusion: we discovered soup on the third course. the food was good but its too much. we would have preferred choosing a more simple menu but that that was not possible. the restaurant is crowded and has bad acoustics so we were unable to carry on a conversation.
the only reason the overall rating is poor instead of terrible is because the wait service on entry was actually dece 
akito sushi has a nice ambience but it is not that great when it comes to service. plates remained not picked up fromtable. long waits between dishes. sushi is decent but there are far better places in the hague. miso soup was tasteless.
"nice menu, but way too much rice in sushi so i couldnt taste any fish. although the service was good."
"ive been here on wednesday night to enjoy some sushi. the experience didnt start so good since we had to wait 30 minutes before we were helped at our table. this wasnt because the restaurant was full (it was almost empty). the entire night this was a problem, the teenagers who work here just want to make their money and go home instead of really serve customers. finally we got the tablet (quite cool system) so we could order. the food was mostly good, some dishes were a bit worse but overall i would give the food a 6 out of 10. what was a pity was the fact that the same dish did not taste the same when we ordered it the second time, they used different kind of sauces etc. although it wasnt a terrible experience, i would not go here again. better go to moshi moshi or one of the sushi restaurants in the hague."
"this is a typical chinese restaurant with the traditional dishes. the service is fast and efficient. the food is good, but nothing special. portions are big enough to share, or have it boxed for the other day."
"me and my girlfriend went there to have a nice italian meal. a trattoria typically push on a condensed menu with high quality raw materials, here instead there was everything (including pizza) and low quality. we took an home appetizer to share: fried squids + mushrooms + prosciutto and salami + carpaccio and roastbeef. all in one dish fish and meat, really no sense. salami were really low quality and high margin products. then we ordered gnocchi alla sorrentina which were overwhelming of garlic and rigatoni salciccia e funghi with super liquid cream and parsley, i had acidity after few minutes. then we ordered a seabass, which was ok, and ossobuco which was good but with a ragu really acid. service was below par but justifiable by the fact that they were all very young and unexperienced (f.i. forks and knife posed on the table with no napkin). the place itself is decent with a nice terrace but food is really bad"
"pizzas was not dry and tasteless. all in family had different pizzas, only one was decent. in addition the wait for the food was very long."
i have been to many italian pizzas but rarely have i had such a disgusting pasta as this one. pasta from a pack which had barely been cooked served with a mushroom sauce from a pack. my partners pizza was less disgusting but still pretty bad. will never come back.
"we thought we would spend the last night of our holiday at somewhere special, what an error! the decor and ambiance is fine, thats where it ends.20 minutes after we arrived we managed to order 4 starters, only 3 turned up, had to reorder. we chased the staff to order wine, the montepulciano was not available i asked for the waitress advice on an equivalent dont know dont drink red she sa "

"besides the nice settings and location, the food and service were absolutely horrible!! the hostess was extremely rude and the waitresses were very inexperienced. the food was even worse. we ordered veal escalope with white wine & lemon dressing and it was not even remote to what we expected. the dry and tough meat was nasty and they gave us a separate plate with extremely dry and overcooked vegetables. well, not even a decent plate of food, but more like 2 pieces of broccoli, 3 disgusting potatoes and a piece of mango on the side. the portions were also very very sma "

"the food was quite nice but not amazingly good. it lacked a bit of flair in the way its being presented and how the plates are made up. the place is nicely decorated and looks very stylish, open doors to the kitchen (noise and strong neon light) are not good.. the place the restaurant is located in has a lingering sewer problem that also the new owner has not yet repaired, the result is a slight smell in the restaura "
"for being a bit pricy the food was quite disappointing, especially their three course menu. i would go for the carpaccio and the putanesca if i were you. the service was poor. they forgot to bring us the wine we ordered and we had to wait for a looooong time to get very simple desserts. the waitor rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could pay seperatly. (we had to because we had to pay with different company credit cards)"

it used to be one of our favorite greek restaurants. a few weeks ago we went there with the whole fami 
quantity of gyros and tzaziki could be better. also feta was poor in the salad. menu is good as well as the red house wine.
"the food here was good and plenty. dinner comes with bits of potato and a salad. plenty of choice for everyone and kids menu available. service was ok as well, but what i suspect was the owner or manager was a bit dismissive."
"poor service. wrong order was served, which was solved too quickly with luke warm croquette. although we ordered a bottle of wine it was not possible to get a glass of tap water. instead we had to order bottled water at a price of more than € 6,00 per bottle….!"
"good for a tasty lunch and dinner, pleasant personnel, wines ok. pice quality is very good, quite some wines by the glass"
"with friends we visit t hoofd. beautiful location at the nieuwe waterweg. nice food, with a fine choose. but, what a horrible service. you saw the shape of a thumb in the carpaccio, we had at least 6 different waitresses at our table, the plates by every courses didnt came at the same time (sometimes with 5 min in between), food fell on our lap during cleaning, bad clothing choice for the waitresses, long waiting time and so on. there is enough space for improvement"
"in this nice location, you get good food however an extremely slow service. they can not manage all the guests. mix up of the food and drinks we ordered."
"i dont want to write this given that i live within walking distance and it occupies such a good position next to the water, but "
a very well designed new cafe/restaurant right by the nieuwe waterweg canal. prices above average. food of all five of us average. small portions in comparison with similar places in maassluis. staff ok.facility has parking. train station 10 minutes walk. the outside terras opposite cafe superbly done and lovely place for a drink and watch the ships go by.!
"food not cooked well, ingredients mentioned on the.menu not found! dirty cutlery, unfriendly service. gone before dessert was served to never coming back!"
"we picked this restaurant for a family dinner, based on previous experiences by some of our group who had eaten here as a coup "
"the food was good, the prices are decent, the staff can not handle the number of guests. you really ger a slow service."
this restaurant is in the middle of the centre located at the nice harbour but unfortunately you cannot view that out of the restaurant. the food is ok as is the atmosphere; if you make a reservation ask for a table downstairs as the few tables upstairs make you feel a bit lonley.
mediocre food. it may be that we came on a quiet night when the head chef was off as it seemed that anything that needed more than the microwave wasnt gre 
"we ordered take away dinner during covid lockdown. i read reviews before and wanted to try their spare ribs, which were good. but rest is simply horrible: veggies and fries are from cheap, deep frozen industrial ingredients. salmon appetizer- is simple a smoked salmon that you can find in any low quality supermarket and put on your plate. seriously if you do great meat dishes, why don’t you invest in nice garnish? because it ruined all the experience (("
the worst dinner we ever had at a restaurant and very expensive ! this restaurant was « booked » by the b&b we were staying at and we discovered the principle when we arrived: 4 meals « surprised » for 45€.
very bad and aggressive owner !!!! bad food and sour peppers 🌶  and he got mad because if it crazy never seen this before!
"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"

"a place which really benefits from its location. a good 20minutes walk to anywhere else means you have few options. consequently, this place can inflate its prizes for what you get. good is good. but expensive."
"we visited this place last summer where we had an all-round great experience and were looking forward to enjoying our dinner once again in this brasserie conveniently located opposite a playground for children. the atmosphere has very much changed and the standards of service somehow have fallen since last summer: we found the staff who took our orders particularly unfriendly and rude. given our unpleasant experience ordering drinks, we walked away to another place for dinner. the menu card looked different too from last year: not the surprisingly diverse choice out of traditional dutch and frisian recipes seen last year at the same place. fins gourmets, passez votre chemin...."
"meneer wong is located in vleuten, 20 mins bus ride from utrecht central. the place has a good interior decoration, however this was the only plus point it got from me. the place has many many points to improve. first of all, they cook the tuna fish they serve with their sushi and this is a cruical mistake. their policy of ordering 1-2 plates in every round could have been understood if the portions were really small. their fried food, salads and sushi are very average and they charge quite big amount of money for this. i will not go to that place again and would not recommend."
"the menu ofers small bites of asian fusion cooking with some larger portions. the sushi is fresh and delicious, and the other bites tastefull albeit often deepfried. service is ok, accoustic somewhat noisy. ok and not very expensive dining venue."

nice restaurant to go to with your children and family. good italian food. easy close by parking. saturday live music and lively atmosphere.
"i really want to like olive because i like to support local restaurant but i just am not impressed. they can’t seem to decide what type of restaurant they want to be. is it greek, italian or spanish? do i have a main course or do i have tapas from a small selection? the patio is nice and in the summer you have an amazing view. but after trying this place twice i don’t plan on giving them a third chance. "
"even after eating here i am not sure whether the main focus of the place was italian or spanish or greek. for the most part, it ended up not offering the best from these countries. the selection of dishes to offer seemed slightly strange. four of us ate there and decided to have tapas/mezes only. some of the plates like the calamares and the patatas bravas were ok – it is hard to mess these up. the pumpkin balls were also good, however the greek salad was as far removed from a typical greek salad as the moon is from athens. it was dire. the house red wine – italian – was ok but pricey. the first bottle that we had was too warm. the outside decking area was ok but nothing special. the service was a bit inconsistent – some of the waiters were better than others. i do not remember seeing any female staff - strange. i am sure you will find better places to eat in vleuten"
"the place is nothing special, but like in all chinese restaurants you get a lot of good food for a low price. i go here regularly to get my stomach filled. the food is just good"
"we love ordering our take away chinese from dong hui, have never been disappointed by the quality. you always receive more food than you could possibly eat and its always delicious. delivery time is always quick. and its really handy that you can order and pay through the thuisbezorg ap. makes ordering so much easier"
the quantity was quite good and the price was quite reasonable. but the food did not taste great despite the menu saying that certain dishes were spicy.
lets start positive: the food was good and tasty. no problems here. but we had quite a laugh becau 
"fish mixed platter was all.frozen breadcrumed food. nothing fresh. 65 euro for a handful of deep fried snacks from the wholesalers. found part of plastic bag in our cole slaw. call the staff, never even apologized or offered some form of service. just that she would show the chef. took the salad away and never replaced it. mixed grill platter was a disaster, dry met, reheated giros, very tough lam chop. baklava supposed to be greek signature dish. was not made fresh but store bought and of very poor quality. very disappointing experience. this place has been there too long, decor is 45 years old and so is their menu. staff tired and not interested. dont go there."
i am very sorry but in my opinion this establishment is not worthy of the number one position of restaurants in maarssen.there were 5 family members on a saturday evening.the food is no better than average.my mixed grill was similar to what you get in any kebab joint.the starter took half an hour to appear and the main course another one and a quarter hours.i complained to three different members of staff.one even had the audacity to dispute the length of time between courses.she argued that it had only been 45 minutes which was acceptable!this was a lie.i was then told by yet another staff member that our 5 meals would be delivered in 4 minutes.they arrived 20 minutes later!!there were no apologies but they could see we were not happy so offered a free drink.this was little compensation for such incompetence and undiplomatic behaviour.needless to say we did not bother to order a desert.we could see that various other customers were also dissatisfied.there are numerous restaurants in maarssen and most are better than this one.i recommend that you give this one a miss and spend your money elsewhere.
close to hotel carlton in walking distane. food compared what you get is expensive. taste okay but nothing special.
"different set menus to share. some of them were good some very average. fish was ok, prawns not very good. chicken is nice,..soups are fine."
"was staying at the carlton president in utrecht for a trade show and wandered down to this restaurant one evening.  decor was nice, but food was average and pricey.  a single noodle dish was the equivalent of us $19.00."

"in a warm evening we had a dinner there with friends. kind staff, starters and food satisfying, but could not be considered excellent."
this is what the most people like: cosy and not too high standards for delicacy. we only had a starter: looked pretty but without feeling for good cooking.
"we came in for a quick dinner after a long trip. only after we had finished our drinks we became aware of the fact the kitchen opnend after 6 pm, although we directly ordered it wasnt mentioned to us. the quality of the food was poor, small rations and lousy french fries. however after travelling through belgium is was a pleasure to be served by adequate staff."
i visited this establishment with a business friend and it started out perfectly nice on the terrace next to the canal. sun was shining a good beer and glass of wine. we were helped by a young man who just started so wasn’t up to speed yet but charming and helpful. one other waitress was also pleasant enough. but one waitress had an attitude and that is just not acceptable in the hospitality indust 
"the restaurant has a sitting area on the vecht where u can have a drink or eat. as starter i had the tuna which was quite disappointing in terms of taste, presentation and size. it was very tiny pieces of tuna in a lot of broth. we enjoyed the main course more. the beef was tender and tasty. the fish was an average pan fried one...the service was good."
"this is a great example of a wanna be. great terrace on the river vecht but thats about it. meat was dry, gnocchi were anything but that and when i asked about it i was informed that the square, deep fried things on the plate were indeed gnocchi. worst meal i have had in a long time! "
"this restaurant has a fantastic terrace next to the river that flows through maarssen... we were here on a summers evening, so it was packed. the food was of a very high quality and the service was good ... all good, and was close to giving it 4/5. perhaps next time :-)"

"fine food and good service. the menu is ok and let you choose between meat, fish en salads. the menu is simple but adequate"

"we had lunch on the terrace near the water, which was good. the staff was friendly and the service was fast. and of course we were excited to eat out again after lockdo "
"we had to wait so long for our food, it ruined the evening. waiting staff tried hard but obviously the kitchen/management could not cope. what a disappointment."
"we had dinner last night with a party of three. the parking is free and the interior looks nice. we received 2 menus for 3. bit strange, why not just 3? we ordered starters and main dishes. the fish was €30, that is a bit over the top. all 3 dishes tasted good. normal portions nothing oversized. one portion of rice comes along. for 2 it will fit but not 3. no questions asked for additional rice. we skipped dessert, tea/coff "
"this spacious restaurant presents a rather odd mix of asian food, a little bit of chinese, thai and subliminal indonesian cuisine. the food is well prepared, but relatively generic in taste and definitely lacks spiciness. personnel is very friendly and welcoming, despite the lack of ambiance per se. we would return, but simply with the prospect of a nice meal, rather than gastronomic adventure."
when you walk in the restaurant you get a nice atmosphere and get your own seati 
"in uk, we used to wait to be seated, here you walk and get served. at first the dutch lady who served me did not speak much english, and could not tell me the special, then tried to sell me something off the menu then got another waiter who was really good, gave me the run down, starters, soups, then mains half a chicken etc.plus help your self salary, not much to say. if you like harvester salary, then your be very disappointed he "
the food offered by mei wah is good without discussion. however the environment is old fashioned and could use a renovation badly. service is with a big smile but when its busy you have to wait quite long. its not expensive!
friendly staff and they fixed the issue by taking it off the bill without having to ask for it. the chips were also fantastic and my wife enjoyed her pea so 
"from the first moment our waiter was all but welcoming. after some low quality fried typical dutch appetizers, the 6 of us had to wait 55 minutes for our main course. when prompted why it was taking so long for the fish & chips the waiter replied: thats because you ordered the appetizers! (?!?). when finally the food came the chips were hardly warm, no crispy and the crust around the cod was overcooked, really hard to crush. we were mildly vocal about the all thing and the same waiter not even apologetic... despite the order came out even wrong as one of us had requested chicke "
"we got to sit at 13:30, and the main dishes at 3:20. we were told that we had to wait so much since we took starters, and it was our fault."
"this pub should have everything going for it. location, atmosphere etc but the service was truly dreadful. there were 11 customers inside and another 8 on the terrace. my husband went to the bar and ordered a beer and a red wine. simple enough you might think. ten minutes later we still had not been served despite the fact there were 4 employees wandering about. we gave up and went across the road to ome kos where we got immediate service."
"stopped to get some drinks and snacks, regretfully no table available in the shade. we waited quite long without getting any service, heating up more and more. luckily a table freed at the neighbors, so we left and got instant service."
"on a sunny evening, visit this restaurant with a terrace directly next to the canal. as you see the boats pass by, enjoy your dinner at the waterfront. when its the season order mussels. youll get a big pan full of mussels. service is bit slow."
"i was so disappointed when i came here with my wife and a couple of friends as a stop on our cycle around het gooi. we each ordered a beer and a tapas plateau to share (for €13.50) from the borrelkart (drinking snacks menu) expecting that it would be an adequate snack for the 4 of us, however the plateau came out with a few paltry slices of meat and a thin crust of bread. when we questioned the quantity we were told that the plateau was a starter for 1 person (despite it being on the drinking snack menu) and that we could not return it in lieu of another item. we were incredibly disappointed by both the food we ordered and by the service we received during our visit, and as such we would not recommend this bar when there are so many pleasant venues within such a small town."
"called here for a late lunch after visiting the castle. the terrace is directly next to the canal, with a view over the bridge and all the boats going though the locks. menu was fine, if limited. the quality of the food we had, was good and the staff very helpful. well worth trying here, if only for the position in the town."
"my, my boyfriend any my best friend went to amsterdam for a short trip. we cycled to muiderslot castle (15km one way) and have a walk around the castle and the garden. before we decided to cycled back, we wanted to have a lunch and decided for this place which was the worst idea ever. we sat inside as it was very warm outside and wanted to cool down a little b "
"the restaurant had a great atmosphere it was a typical old dutch cafe and the decoration added a nice touch. it also has a nice location near the river. when we sat down, we had to wait quite a while for someone to come take our order and after that even longer until the food was served. the people were not particularly friendly either. the food, when it came, was very nice but that did not completely make up for the poor service."
right next to uncle ko situated. just a fisherman eatery. do not expect haute cuisine. but certainly in the herft or in early spring a great place to sail to eat after a day.
"we waited 20 minutes for a table outside because they wouldnt let us sit inside which was completely empty. when a table came free outside, the waiter slapped a reserved sign down. we cycled on to naarden which was much prettier and had more choices of cafes with friendlier people. "
"the food is nice, but as the place was crowded, it took a long time to be served. some of the dishes from the menu were sold out (i wanted to order cod but there was none left). very noise and popular, busy and conviviaal though."
"this place has been here forever and ive been coming here for over 30 years. menu is still the same, food is decent, but service seems to be deterioratin "
a very nice spot in a little town. its a cosy place for a lunch or dinner. i come here now and then for over many years and it didnt change that much. its still good and they have nice food. try the sat 
"when you go to a restaurant its not just the food, its quality, service and atmosphere. we got none of this today. unbeliavebly horrible pasta, vongole and one plain for a kid. cheap patè. all dishes, pretending to be french cousine, are arranged well in advance and poorly heated on the spot before serving. only 6 more guests present for lunch and the service was disorganized and slow. the plateau royal was hilarious, stale oysters, sparse grilled(?) shrimps and a raw half lobster."
"we wanted to eat at a french restaurant in muiden for bastille day. we spotted dedeolen right near the locks with an eclectic interior. the menu was difficult to discern the difference between starters or main dishes, without much help from our waiter who probably was the owner. there was also a 3 or 4 course fixed price meal, which referred to a separate menu, which was never provided. one of us ordered a salad nicoise, which arrived with no potatoes, anchovies or olives, basically overcooked tuna on salad with canned mushrooms. when we inquired about the lack of the standard ingredients, the waiter said thats the way we serve it here. the unpleasantness continued to the end when we got the bill. it included the price of a large portion of a plate, when we clearly ordered ordered a small portion, and a plate that we clearly did not order. on complaining, the waiter questioned our dispute and didnt believe he had included a non ordered plate. when we counted the number of dishes he reluctantly adjusted the bil "
a small restaurant with a great atmosphere. food was small and was still hubgty after the visit. waiters were not focussed and soft drinks were hot.
"food was decent, staff friendly and we ate enough. but we had a very bad surprise when we went to pay: bottle of water of 0.75 cl was billed 6.50 € (not indicated in the menu). never seen something like this!!"
nice place (not expensive) for dinner with a group. service and furnishing are basic but ok. price/quality ratio is good. good variance in the menu.
if you wont to eat a lot then this is the place to go. the food is not a great but good enough. on a huge menu youll find something you like for sure. stuff is very friendly .
"staff very friendly. all you can eat sushi. value for your money. fish, meat  and veggies something for everyone."
"i went there because of the tripadvisor opinions, and apart from the service which was good, i ended up really deceived about the food quality (the fish was not even close to fresh) and the price, high if we take into account such quality."
"well, you cant expect much of an all you can eat restaurant with 3 sorts of food: japan, thai and chinese. it works the same as every all you can eat restaurant with a bit more variety to choose from. its always busy in this restaurant, but i guess its just not my cup of tea. if you want to have some descent food, ok flavors and a lot, youre at the right place. they had a strange drink on the menu: avocado milkshake; tasted good thoug "
great view but over priced run-of-the-mill menu. the poke bowl was 20€ which included 5-6 shrimp & despite the elaborate description was very mundane. i’m not sure i’d bother going again. 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
"per boerenfijn is a well known chef in the area that i call home. springer is a family restaurant with a rich and sometimes classic cuisine, per cooks with rich sauces and loves to cook game, venison and well just loves food and honest ingredients. his daughter margot runs the place and is a sommelier extraordinai "
food was good. solid menu with a focus in the main courses which were well received by everybody. service was a bit slow and we got little assistance when informing about the wine options.
wonderful views and okay menu. but when diner was served (very good asperagus by the way) i asked for a glass of sauvignon with icecubes. the wine was served but without the cubes. so i did not drink the wine. they still charged me full price! so bad service.
"we had lunch here. the menu is small, which doesnt have to be bad, if there is an interesting choice. we had the pork satay and the shrimp cocktail with a bun. the satay apparently came prefab from freezer to microwave. on the side some shrimp crackers for which you can rip open a bag in the supermarket. french fries were smelling a bit of used oil. the shrimp cocktail consisted of some salad, dried tomato and dutch shrimp covered by an ordinary pink sauce of the type you get in the supermarket as well. the bun was steaming, soggy from heating in the microwave. total bill with two fresh drinks and two coffees nearly 40 €. thats rather steep, even for dutch standards. and the view, on the border of the river, doesnt really compensate as the opposite riverbank is industrial. just go to a snackbar in town and youll be better of. waiters were a bit slow, and sometimes there was no one to attend."
the resturant belevedere is a nice place to relax after a city walk. it is true that the place could be renewed - or maybe not. it has charm of decades ago and a terrace with a nice view on the river lek.the food is good and personnel are nice and polite. you can really relax there as the time stops.
evening started not so well. hot evening and had reserved outside table weeks ahead after a colleague highly recommended it... but was refused despite several free tables outsid 
"i came here with my family, there were 8 of us in the party so at first we thought this place was a great find as it seemed spacious and modern. unfortunately the service was rude and very inattentive. the food was ok but nothing specia "
"we called in here before dinner for two glasses of cava, which seemed reasonable value at €6. we visited again on another occasion and had two glasses of the house red. this was a big mistake as it was probably the worst red wine we had ever had in our lives, it was undrinkable. we will definitely avoid the house wine in future."
not much else to say really. this is located in a busy area of a busy town so is good for a coffee or beer sitting at the tables outside and watching the world go by. free wifi too if you ask for the code.
we eat at the outside terrace. good location close to a square and in one of the main shopping streets. we were note very much impressed with the moules- frites we eat there. when serving the food the flies came along. big portions but not tastefull at all. overpriced at 27.5 euro a pers 
disappointing: we were four people but only one of us was satisfied with her fo 
"unlimited mosselen sounds wow isn’t? in my opinion is just ok, but for this price what else do we need to complain??! service are nice, their staff were friendly and nice view to sit outside. only need to be aware with cars that always passing by next to u"
"for once i did not consult tripadvisor in advance. the balmoral restaurant can be an option, for me only if you can be seated on the terrace. the interior is not my style. the food is of reasonable price and quality. be careful with extras as they are all charged separately (even the mayonnaise). they do not serve tap water together with a bottle if wine (only small bottles of expensive mineral water). therefore 2 star in stead of 3. espresso is of poor quality. toilets were not clean. it is worrysome that they dont seem to care being the least rated restaurant in town. "
"i almost never put a negative review on tripadvisor but this time i feel i should share my experience. we walked in the restaurant, sat down, were given the menu. while we were making up our minds about what to eat, we ordered drinks. a glass of white wine for one person and half a liter of red wine for the other three. the waiter came back with a glass of white wine, a carafe of red wine and two empty glasses. he said that he was not allowed to give us three glasses for the red wine. because according to his boss, half a liter of red wine was for two persons, not three. in my entire life i never heard something like this and i visited thousands of restaurants all over the world. we were flabbergasted. the waiter was very embarressed, but he was not allowed to give us an extra glass: 1/4 liter is for one person, 1/2 liter for two, and i assume a bottle is for three then? the fourth person at the table does not get a gla "
"what a horrible restaurant! i really did not think this existed anymore, but everything herewas terrible! the service was bad, after being seated it took forever to get our drinks. even though there were enough waiters and not a lot of people. the food is the worst, a vegetable soup without vegetables!! it was right out of a can, or worse, a dissolving salt block with some spaghetti in it. the quality / price ratio was really bad and i actually did not want to pay full price for this horrific experience. we complained several times to the service people, but they did not seem to care. i will never come again and i will never recommend anybody to go here."
food is not more than average and rather pricy for what you get. cappuccino is one of the worst ive ever got. all the waiters are young men from eastern europe. there are far more better spots in sluis.
"we had dinner here on a friday evening. we receives a very pleasant service from an older waiter who had an accent that could make him pass as italian. unfortunately, his friendly and pleasant demeanour wasnt matched by the rest of the staff. mostly men in their late teens/ early twenties who were decidedly uninterested in waiting on all male customer "
"ter kade is a spacious,clean & tidy establishment located near to the dead end of the canal in sluis, zealand province, netherlan "
"the waitress we had was friendly and chatty. she helped us with the pronunciation of a few words, we found out she had holiday in the uk not far from where we live "
well located near the canal in the city centre. very crowded. food is of medium quality and prepared with a lack of knowledge. quite expensive for what you get. for the same money there is better in sluis
we took a lunch over here and were not surprised by the quality of the food. price quality was quite low. however the salad was very fresh. less adopted for kids.
"came across this restaurant after cycling to sluis from bruges. it looked good and right in the main square so we went in, ordered a coka cola and a sandwich and waited...... and waited....... and waited. the coke did arrive, delivered by a very surly waitress, but it was quite busy so we carried on waiting. finally, after waiting no less than 45 minutes, during which time we asked if it was coming to be told, by the same waitress, it was just being made, we left money for the cokes and walked out. such a shame as it is a great location and we were very hungry but 45 minutes to make a sandwich is ridiculous."
"our omelettes were tasteless and boring, chips sad, salad even sadder.  service average, prices average, but too much for this standard of food.  we were not happy and wont visit again."
"late afternoon 4 pm ish, called for our early evening meal. it was empty which should have rang alarm bells but we just put it down to the hour. service was indifferent. slow to arrive with the drinks despite there being no one else there. ordered 2 x half chickens and ribs + chips. of the 2 chickens, 1 was ok but the other was still breathing, no well not quite, but when i cut into it it was still bleeding. i immediately told the waitress who wasnt in the least bit apologetic, simply took it away. now any descent restaurant would have started again with fresh produce. not this one. when i got my plate back, it was the same chicken. this time i think nuked whereas at first it was obviously deep fried due to the amount of oil it was sitting in. the ribs were very dry and quite tasteless. only saving grace was the chips which were good. would i go again. no chance."
"with our family from germany (4 persons) we visited sluis and wanted to have a light lunch in de corner: 1 soup, 1 saled and a shared portion of musse "
we sat down for a quick bite. we got so much more.. it was very good. see below the picture of the tortillas.
"i was here for a lunch, light soup and meatkrokets. the peesoep was very good but the meat was not so present in the croquets i ve got served , nice salad aside and fresh bread. still a good place to go, for sandwich or meal."
"the restaurant has a wonderful location and looks very pretty inside. we selected the place based on the tripadvisor reviews but failed to realize that (late) in the afternoon we only get the lunch menu. after our disappointment, we still decided to stay. the menu was more like a magazine and was only in dutch (i was quite surprised to find the lack of english menus in quite a few places – needless to say, in most places the wait staff could translate the menu for us). the food was ok but nothing special. what annoyed us –and apparently other guests too – that we had to wait an awful lot for both the food and the bill. maybe, the high ranking of the restaurant is due to the food that is served in the evening."
"the day menu was quite ok for its price. the fries and fish were nice, but i didnt feel completely full after the meal. all in all an ok place, but not the best."
"came midday and were able to be seated immediately. got drinks and ordered food relatively quickly-maybe 10 minutes. no special orders, no picky requests, no difficult interactions. 35 min later, the host spontaneously came and said “5 more minutes” which is the same that was said 15 minutes later. we left, (i left $$$$$ for the spritz and the coffee-far more than it cost.) the food around us looked good…"
"well situated in sluis, the restaurant 🍴 is very touristic. the bouillabaisse is a simple fish 🐟 soup 🍲, but at least having a good taste. the mussels are of very average taste and the 1kg500 announced are more just 1kg, anyhow enough. the french fries 🍟 are ok 👌, the service is just as average as the rest, except for the prices which are rather high. "
we just walked in sluis and found that place. there is a nice selection of dishes and in our case the service was friendly and quick. we did not finish our aperitif that the dished were there. the wine by the glass is a bit on the high side.
"maybe they think that for tourists it doesn’t really matters? we had to wait quite some time for the drinks and food as well. salad with the meat was very poor, tomatoes not pealed, not even a good vinaigrette. with the fish cooked potatoes ... you know the ones they buy in plastic bags already cleaned ! the chef really doesn’t has time to clean a fresh potatoe ? better to open a pizzeria, and give spaghetti!"
i have been today there and we had to wait for an hour. the service was really slow and no friendly at all. the steak too done and without flavour at all. bad service bad food to spend 3 hours there.
correct should you take fish plate but quite expensive globally. not the best restaurant in the city but easy to access... dont forget to speak flemish!!
ok..... finally food.   wrong plate.... my wife her plate is as we speak now almost finished.  my meal is still somewhere.  never again.
"i have known this restaurant since many years, and i have almost always eaten mussels in white wine source. the mussels seem to be better in other restaurants i know in sluis, but they are more costly, too. the atmosphere is good and the service is rather quick."
my wife and i went here to taste the zeeland mussels in white wine and with fries last sund 
visited andric as the lady wanted mossels met friet which she got a pan fu 
"we needed a quick lunch and decided for andric. generally clean and the fish dishes looked nice so we decided to go in. carpaccio was nice but the schnitzel disappointing. we never had a bread basket, only spicy peanuts which was odd as we had young children in the company. the french fries were obviously reheated. poor quality of food. "
"went for dinner, took an aperitif. food its self was a mix of good and avera "
"we had a good meal here about three years ago so we went back on our trip to sluis last week. sadly we were disappointed. my starter of prawn crocquettes was fine (my wife didnt have a starter) but both hers and my main courses were unsatisfactory. she had pork schnitzel which arrived practically floating in a lake of oil which, even after pouring it off, made the dish practically inedible. i ordered mixed fish casserole. now, im well aware that something can be lost in translation with menus but a casserole should be pretty much the same in any language. when mine arrived it wasnt a casserole at all but an assortment of dry, fried pieces of fish (full of bones) and a few fried mussels.plus a bit of salad. if id known that was what i was going to get id never have ordered  "
"it all started very well, great starter and very good main, and a very nice bottle of wine. unfortunately we appeared to go off the radar after this, the waitress never came near to ask about deserts,coffee or drinks and i got the distinct impression the owner who was sitting nearby playing poker on a tablet new i was about to complain because he seemed to disappear. end result was 2x starters; 2x mains and one bottle of wine= 83 euros"
"we went to this restaurant yesterday as it had shade and we were all boiling. big mistake ! the service was unfriendly , the food was small, burnt and tasteless and over priced . shocking !"
this restaurant in typical style is situated on the marketsquare of sluis opposite the belltower ( with tourist office : vv 
terrible service . arrogant behavior of the management. the french fries were under any standard. the mussels were not hot enough... the whole atmosphere was old fashioned . a real deceiving experience. no value at all for mon 
nice cozy place to have some food. local fish or mussels are of course mandatory when eating at the coast.
"in this friendly little tourist town,we came accross this cosy restaurant amongst the well preserved historic surrounding buildings.very friendly service without being pushy.we ate seafood-mussels and a mixed seafood dish,that were well prepared and tasty.a lovely house wine and a reasonable bill.what more can you ask for?"
"great choice of fresh seafood, at fair prices fluctuating in a daily bases. can pretty busy on weekends and during tourist holidays. they also have plant and flower shop downstairs and a (fair priced) fish/seafood & chips foodcourt upstairs that keeps on expandin "
not expensive for good food. self service. not obvious to know where it is (top level of the fish shop).
"the restaurant is alright but it was def not meant for people who unable to speak dutch. i understand not having an english menu, but the wait staff who seemed competent enough were not willing to help out some foreigners understanding the menu, or speaking english after we ordered and made it clear that was all we could do. shame cause we probs would have ordered more food and drink! at least we def would have tipped more for the effort. "
"visiting sluis, a lively little town, we arrived midday and it drizzled. we found a parking spot immediately opposite this restaurant and chose an outdoor table on the covered terrace. the service was quick and correct, but their heart wasnt in  "
the manager is incredibly rude and the food just wasn’t that good. this country is filled with so many lovely people and you don’t need to go out of your way to be treated badly. eat elsewhere.
"the place is located somewhere in a nice middle of nowhere, in zeeland, close to the belgian border. without a gps you will never find i "
"when we made the reservation we relied on the 4 to 5 dots on tripadvisor, sounds like a safe bet. however, 4 to 5 dots are in my opinion overrated. i always try to look at positive elements but this could really be better. the positive side: waiters and waitresses work hard and really do their best. but they should have more people around as they were understaffed in my opinion. the menu could use more fantasy. putting butter in plastic cups on the table is something you would expect in a cantina or restaurant along the road - this is not a good idea. the crevette salad could have more attention: it felt like a very quick fix. i also do not understand that you put 75 eurocent on the menu for mayonaise. i expect that to be included. taste of the courses we ordered: we have seen better. also taking into account pricing is not quite on the cheap side (that is an understatement). i encourage the restaurant to put more effort in menu and courses for such prices."
"the food was terrible. we ordered some tagliatelle with shrimps and salmon and it was just boiled pasta and boiled shrimps and salmon also boiled, all in a sauce of curry. no taste, nothing"
"went here for lunch, great welcome, kind staff. was looking forward to the “angus burger with cheddar cheese etc "
"popped into this restaurant for the first time, and we were extremely disappointed, we ordered a starter, and a main, everything started off very well, we were served an amuse bouche, then our starter of scampi and salmon arrived scampi ok a bit tasteless , we then had to wait 45 minutes for our main course, which were oysters for my wife, and cod for me, when eventually it arrived we could see that my dish of cod had been left under and probably forgotten some sort of heating to keep it warm, on top of that it had no taste, and wasnt worth the wait, our carafe of wine was very mediocre the service was pretty slow,mind you they were pretty quick to clear our plates away, compared to other places weve eaten in sluis, this place was very little value for money."
"nice pasta and salad , good service. good place for a quick lunch while visiting sluis.  not that expensive for the quality you get"
"you can not fault the restaurants location on the quay in sluis, very good outside terrace, if a little crammed in. the menu is quite extensive but i found it a little overpriced, especially the soft drinks. the food quality is good howev "
ordered 4 portions of mussels @20 euros plus one salade nicoi 
this restaurant offers a comfy cozy interior and quite friendly and swift servi 
"very nice restaurant, but unfortunately the food was average, was a bit bland if compared to other greek restaurants. the service was lacking, we werent even asked if we wanted dessert."
"not horrible if you’re not a greek food fan.  i really wanted greek and felt i got dutch trying to be greek. no authentic grape leaves for example. overall, just lacking atmosphere and authenticity."
"never in my life have i been treated this badly in a restaurant or cafe and i have been to many. the main waitress offended me when i asked after 20 minutes if my order came through than, after 40 minutes in total., still nothing while she looked at our table often. i told her and she just shrugged her shoulders. not even a sorry or surprised look...."
"terrible customer service, careless attention to quality and taste of food served. i ordered an apple tart with nuts. it was served super cold, not really able to taste anything given the serving temperature. when asked to warm up, i was told they had no time to do so. ambiance / space is nice but that is it! "
sorry but it was really not oke. first i was told to order direct because i could only have breakfast untill 11.00 but i was there at 10.35. then i orderded pancakes. this was really bad. they were very dry and hard with a spoon of jam on it. it looked and tasted like nothing. for 10 euro 
"the restaurant is in old greenhouses just outside leiden. visited on a sunday at lunchtime. its very family friendly,  so lots of kids. the food was good if not a little pricey. service was mixed but friendly enough."
"we were given a table in a very noisy place, next to the bar with a very high traffic, people, waitresses passing by, sounds of dishes glasses etc while there were other tables available. the table was not clean, we had to ask for it to be cleaned. it took really long between serving the drinks and ordering food. the food was not warm enough while it was served and the quality vs price was pretty law. i had a feeling i came to a come-eat-go place. poor hospitality."
"cannot comment on food as i could not taste it but found the behaviour of waitress extremely rude. i had been there with my 7 year old son to celebrate fathers day and had requested for a table for two. we were flatly declined and were asked to pick up something from the takeaway joint nearby. the waitress didnot even bother to suggest on a waiting time incase we wanted to wait. i could see lots of couples after us being escorted in who also didnot have any reservations hence could not really fathom the behaviour. in my so many years of stay in netherlands have not come across such a behaviour, may be waitress was having a bad day. stay blessed."
"beautiful view on a sunny day, very nicely designed space, love hanging plan "
"place looks very nice inside. i went there just for a quick drink with my bf after spending some time at the beach. the waitress in the entrance wasn’t very friendly, i’ve been asked in quiete aggressive way if she could help me with somethin "
"the food was nice (although a bit too garlicy), but the service could be much much better. they served us beer in a cracked glass, there was a hair in my plate and it was full of spider webs..."
"i had dinner here last night. the starters were good (a.o. the bieterbal), but the tuna steks were overcooked and not warm! (we specifically asked this before ordering). then they brought us the halibut dish and a quinoa burger. not very much flavour on both. so this was an average experience. great service and good espressos."
"nice location, friendly stuff, food bad. the meat was chewy, bland and for the quality too expansive. i would  not eat here a second time."
"i was refused service here on two occasions. let me elaborate. the first time i visited brasserie buitenhuis, it was about mid day i walked about 1 kilometer from my hotel and upon arrival i explained that my family had flown in earlier that day to leiden via amsterdam schiphol and was jet lagged. as a result i wanted like to get some take away food to carry for them. the man in charge explained that the dont do take away. understanding that some eateries dont do take away i simply left without any foo "

"i just had a surprising experience at this restaurant. being on a bicycle tour with my friends, and dressed for purpose, we were all hoping to have a nice lunch. to our surprise we were prohibited to enter, as our outfits were not allowed to enter the terrace.! we saw people in shorts, sandals, in motor bike clothing, even dogs were allowed in. however, not cyclists dressed as cyclists. that would be acceptable if they offered an alternative location on their terrace but no solution was offered at all! so, plan your trip carefully."

"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
we had dinner in this restaurant last we 
"waited one hour for salads and 12 uurtje lunch which is a simple combination of typical dutch food elements,easy to cook. incredible. it was ok taste but obviously nobody cares anymore if you have to wait one hour. juice not fresh.  not."
"we arrived at noon in plenty of time for the flower parade and got served drinks fairly quickly but our order of 3 tostis, 2 roast beef sandwiches and 1 smoke salmon and prawn sandwiches did not arrive despite frequently hailing a server. eventually at 1 o.clock the tostis arrived they looked pretty insipid and seemed like dried bread rather than toasted bread. after more complaints we eventually got one of the roast beef sandwiches at 1.15. finally we left at 1.30 still without food for 2 of our party. we just left the money on the table because we didnt even get the bill but we had to go to take our seats. go there if you dont mind waiting for hours."
"we been here without reservation and solved us a table infront of kitchen which is cold breeze keep coming each time waiters ot staff get inside and out. there were many seats available in a beter place but not sure not provided to outher guests some of them keep their jackets on . well for the price it is a good place wach thursday all you can way spare ribs 13,50 great deal , i had my holland style chicken it was bland and the sauce ordered saved my diner a bit. spare ribs were fine and the price was ok. lagers good price and our waiter tall and slim guy was good & polite and also other staff was good too. but ambience not for romance or any special day. teddy we loved the idea and friendly staff thats all. good luck."

a good restaurant near highway a17 and easy to find. reasonable prices and good prepared food. friendly  staff and quick serving. large parking place.
"a nice place to have a nice family diner. service is good and there was some enterainment as well . sinterklaas and zwarte piet were visiting and had some candy for the small kids. parents could take pictures of sinterklaas and their kid. food was average, but not bad. for a simple diner a very nice to go to"

the reeuwijkse hout is located very nice. right on the lake and next to the highway exit it is easy to reach and a great spot. the salad (mealsalad) they serve was fresh and nice. the other plate were good but lacked fantasy. it seemed to be prepared at an earlier stage and isnt much different from a snackbar.
"we went there for a quick lunch.  the restaurant is just fine.  normal menu etc.  nice view over the water.   so if you want a quick bite in reeuwijk, this is your place"
"just of the highway but hidden on one of the lakes is this restaurant. i have been there several times and always surprised how busy it is. menu hast changed much in the last few years. the view, especially outside on the terrace is beautiful. food is ok but not really special. still nice place to meet up with friends."
"as i live nearbye i thought it would be great to have beer here with my american guests. imagne my surprise when they said that they did not do glasses of tap water, only bottled water or cooled water at €1.00 a glass! sorry that is not the type of service i expect and my guests were quite gob smacked. in the us jugs of water are always provided before any order is taken. a lesson for this restaurant."
"its nicely located at a lake. during good weather its very nice to use the terras at this restaurant with a nice view. they offer some good salads, sandwiches and are well known for their sate and french fries. friendly st "
"establishment at a nice location but run by people that shouldn’t be in the hospitality business. rude and inhospitable owner. first she snarled that we arrived too early. then we had to wait a long time for our drinks and cake to arrive (which can happen when it’s busy, but not used to someone putting trays on your chair and telling you to find out yourself what everyone ordered or waiting half an hour for a cup of tea). after an hour we wanted to order some finger food and she told us in front of our guests it was too busy and how dare we order lunch without warning her in advance. flabbergasted we asked for the bill and took our guest to our house to provide them with something to eat. some of the staff tried to compensate for the behaviour of their boss and make the best of it but this was an impossible tas "
what a little treasure! here you can relax with a beer next to the water! we ate a ‘broodje haring’ and a ceasarsalade with beer! personnel very friendly! def a place to visit when you are in the area!
"not worth going. prices high, food mediocre, small portions. disappointing. if you are in the area for lunch, the lunch menu is good. but not worth your time and money to find this place and dine here for dinner."
we enjoyed good food and the nice terrace next to the water. one minor thing: they dont serve tap water.
made a reservation in advance for 3 october dinner for 10-12 people. guess what? i was called on the 29th of september (3 days before) and told that i could not be accomodated because there was a wedding there! why not call in advance? really disappointed and very unprofessional from the hotel!
"location still great! but we have so many lovely memories on the spot, dating from over 30 years, and are a bit dissappointed on both the quality of food and the service."
"worst experience ever! after an hour and half still no lunch, drinks took them almost half an hour. our 4th person got his lunch 10 minutes later than the rest. no excuses, no nothing! never again!"
i have eaten here with my sisters wedding. i didnt think they did anything special for her. the menu was boring and didnt tast great.
"we visited this restaurant after quite some time for dinner again. the 4-course menu was good, food was delicious. but the service can be improve "
"because the restaurant has a michelin star we had high expectations. the food was ok, nicely presented, the service is very good and friendly. but the chef is super conservative when it comes to flavors, i just expected more."
very disappointed as reputation was so good. not a lot of taste. mismatch in taste. the only good dish was the duck. where does the star come from?
on may 30th had a 6 course dinner in this restaura 
"this restaurant is in a great location and the food is fab. i would recommend booking as it’s very popular. the only negative i have is that our waitress was more than blunt and bordering on rude. it was a bit of a dampener on an otherwise lovely lunch. it is the only time i can ever recall not tipping but i was incensed by our treatment. our waitress was in charge (or at least thinks she is) on the other waitresses (who were much friendlier) not a good example, sorry."
"never actually leave any reviews but felt like i had to as this restaurant clearly does not deserve the status they claim to have. reserved a table at 20:00, because they are working in shifts but then it appears they don’t as a long line was waiting for a table (where they made a reservation for) but which wasn’t free/ ready. very unprofessional service, when we joined friends of ours at another table and actually in that way solved the staff their problem they asked us ‘to check the bill ourself and arrange this ourself’ this was very rude. young, unprofessional staff who clearly don’t have any experience in hospitality related businesses. food was ok, but don’t ask for these high prices when your service is this poor"
it a local restaurant trip advisor describe it as one of the best places in the area i beg to differ food is reasonable nothing exciting service could improve  the waiter did not know whats campari orange. the location good reasonably priced
"too expensive for very average food in a worn out ambiance, poor unprofessional service and a long wait. the nearby ara hotel restaurant is a much better option."
"what used to be a good (always overpriced) place, turned into worse. waiter not interested for his guests, waiting too long to get ordered bread. my “tompouce” of asperges and smoked salmon was very bad. the crust was soft lile a sponge. even mentioning this was a confirmation at nothing more. ordered different ways of preparing our two soles, but when it was served theydid not have any clue. the asperges on a side where overcooked and too much lemon used. and than the price still overprized"
"i havent been there for a while. so to me it came as a surprises that the interior as been changed into a trendy restaurant look and feel. but thats the only change. still the same smooth service, delicious white wine and a lobster. main courses are mostly around the 25 eu "
"restaurant had a cozy atmosphere with a nice retro style before, but after a change in ownership it has become quite dull without any real decorations. i came to waal with my girlfriend quite early so there were barely any people. we wanted to sit next to the windows, however the waitress told us it was impossible because the seat was reserved for people with a dog. i could understand it for one of the seats, but there were a total of five seats still vacant! finally the waitress gave us a seat in the back of the restaurant, even though the place was almost empty! after asking a waiter if we could change seats to a seat near the window he told us it was no problem and was also amazed the girl said it was not possible. after we changed seats the waitress who showed us the seat in the first place was talking with other waitresses and all of a sudden they all looked our way! not a comfortable feeling. as a starter we ordered a carpaccio which was absolutely delicious. for the main course i ordered the pasta pesto and my partner ordered the half lobster with soup. my pasta was not great, but also not bad. the lobster itself was great, but the soup we got in the first place was quite sour. we were told in the first place that we could have as much soup as we wanted. at first a waitress, who seemed to be a new worker, came to us with a small pot with the soup inside. when my partner asked to give us a bowl to fill with soup instead of pouring it on a plate with rice a more senior waitress came and reacted very strong and unfriendly that we could have a bowl once we finished this plate. after the first bowl a friendly older waiter came to us with more soup and also offered to put some liquor in the soup, why the waitress didnt offer this in the first place is unclear... because my partner liked the soup she wanted another bowl, however the waitress said it was not possible because they were out of soup(?!) it was still early so we knew this was very strange, finally the woman said it was not that they were out but the last bit in the pot was not edible so they wouldnt give us, even though we could see last time the waiter came there was still plenty of soup in the pot. after confronting the waitress she said that if we wanted more we had to order a soup for 10 euro!!! in the end she gave in and gave us another lobster soup, however this one was much more delicious than the one offered together with the lobste "

friendly service i had a dish plaice rolled around salmon expecting the fish to be fresh in reflection of the price unfortunately it wasnt it was quite poor a disappointing meal !
"... would have liked to be informed upfront that we would not be sitting in the actual restaurant but one of the (albeit nice) other rooms in the castle. it was very noisy and the music could hardly be heard, albeit at some stage it was put louder but with music that had nothing to do with christmas. service was friendly but not always efficient and we needed to explain about our special request three times and still the wrong cutlery and courses were put on the table. the food was high quality as was the wine. and again, location location location. could have been very good but because of the flaws not sure i would book again next year."
"the restaurant is really spacious and is both suitable for bigger groups, families with children or couples. the decoration is really nice, the wine bottle wall in the entrance especially caught my attentio "
excellent sushi - all you can eat  -  incl a large dessert section. sushi is fresh and creative new sushi i had not seen before at these kind of restaurants. staff friendly and service is fast. located at the hoogvliet shopping area.
we heard about the green star from michelin en where excited to try this restaurant. we love vegetarian food and also loved the idea of 80/20 vegatables/mea 
"bad service, terrible pizza, expensive .  pizza dough was either burnt or soggy. the air spray was so overwhelming that even the water tasted of it. very expensive for very very bad pizza and terrible service."
"first visit to this restaurant and a little bit disappointed despite the fact that the waitresses were nice. our entree/amuse was forgotten (!); you dont aks for it, though. the service was slow. the terderloin, i ordered was indeed from the grill but, in the middle red and absolutely not medium cooked. i mentioned it, but it was too late to be returned to the chef (which i understood). as a compensation i was offered a free drink, which was nice though. my partner had the tagliatelli with sea fruits. that was nice!."
"my wife treated me and our sons for a father’s day dinner. fathers got a a free belgian beer from the house, which was a very nice gesture. our food was good, but it did not blow me awa "
"nice outdoor seating  and historic building. but:  (plastic)  menu extremely simple and limited, way overpriced (e.g. €20 burger, €18 for one satey skewer), very small portions and food badly (mostly under) cooked."
"we each had the4 course for €32,50 eachplus a €39 bottle of pinot noir. wine wastasty, service was pretty good, for a dutch restaurant. food was nice, the gazpacho soup was heavy on the garlic, but as long as you both have it, eh? our mains were steaks and they didnt ask what temp we would like, they were cooked a decent medium, but i prefer rare so that wasslightly disappointing. however, value for money it was quite nice. presentation was nice. staff is friendly. "
"i’m disappointed to be writing this review, because the location is great and the restaurant has potentia "
service extremely slow. we had to call the waitress several times to order. a pity since the place has a nice decoration.
"we did a family dinner here. the location is nice and it offers a really nice playground for the kids. but the establishment is targeting the trendy upscale crows and you can tell walking in. its all there but it lacks a welcome atmosphere. staff is nice and helpful but the food was average. i ordered a tournedo and it was tender but a little too rare for liking. the chicken with mango chutney was nicely presented but flat in taste. and the tuna steak was too salty. so all in all, nice presentation but average on food. "
"don’t order here! at mother’s day my husband and my daughter tried to make me a surprise ordering a nice breakfast! it was not delivery, no one answered phone, emails or whatsapp! the site confirmed and sent a confirmation email and even with that they didn’t show up! very disappointed! "
"we had a lunch with family and, the lunch card is ok and everyone found something. the sandwich portions are proper but the (more expensive) other meal not a lot. the quality of the food was  "
"cote du bouef was most expensive dish, had 60% fat, three staff members came to review. no sympathy, that is the way it should be. the chimicurru sauce was not fresh, did taste bad. 1st and last time for me. total dissapointment. "
beautiful location close to the lake however service is too slow and lengthy despite of the very basic and simple menu list. not sure if we want to come back.
i am nearly 65 and never never had such a bad experience. we took the mirror menu ...55 € . 
"over the last 30 years we probably have visited seidel some six times. nothing seems to have changed here, neither the old style entourage, the menue, nor the presentation of the food on mirro "
i just cant believe people actually like this kind of place. a terribly overpriced restaurant (with a menu in faux french and prices going above €100 for a menu per person) with a lack of atmosphere that even has the staff whispering to each othe 
"eye-wateringly expensive for very, very mediocre quality. yet it must be popular as it was quite busy for a weekday evening. clearly well-heeled clientele, with more money than sense. also feels it is run for the owners rather than the guest. example: a set menu (one of many) has to be taken by the whole table. interesting detail is that the cheapest menu costs about €15 less than when chosen as individual courses, but, no luck, as you must all have it. coffee: is only served as a servies, again, not what the guest wants, which is just a cup of coffee, but what the owners want to sell you at six! euros. the coffee is accompanied by cheap, rubbish quality chocolates and other sweet stuff. their famous mirror’, food served on a large mirror, is a concept that predates noahs ark. totally unmemorable, overpriced and tepid food."
"we took there a set for two. the quantity was enough for two but the quality was terrible. there was to taste, the food was flat, with absolutely no flavour. it didnt taste traditional chinese at all. definitely one of the worst chinese food which i even had in my life. dont waist time and money to go there."
"i think you always have to be careful with anywhere with and all you can eat concept and this place is the reason why. very cynical and mean policies around tap water and children (my 3 year old is very fussy and just wanted a tiny chicken sate, but we still had to pay 11.25). i actually thought it was illegal not to serve tap water if someone asks. we had already bought several rounds of paid drinks, but this shouldnt matter. once you notice these things, you realise the sushi quality is bad, half filled hand rolls, supermarket quality salmon and cheap fillings in everything. 100 euros for a quick, early family meal with below average food and terrible management. terrible experience, will not be back."
"had dinner there a few days ago, 4 adults, 3 kids, we had a a few beers and full dinner, food was correct, we asked for some tap water for the kids, the answer was no, we were told by the owner that the restaurant has a policy of no tap drinking water, you can only purchase water bottles, so weird, then they said they would charge us .50 euros cent per glass, we refused, i went to the mens rooms to get drinking water from the tap for the kids . they will never see us again. does anyone know with whom we can file a complaint about this?"
"to start with the best, great amuses, perfect langoustine tartare with aigre doux, great dover sole and maybe the best ever sweat breads, beautiful crust and wonderful lusciousness inside (not sure the red cabbage with apples to accompany was a good idea), wonderful cheese platt "
the reastaurant did not meet our expectations the atmosphere was more snobbish than cosy the food was ok but not at à guide rouge level ! never again
"after not having been at de bokkedoorns for over 50 years, i returned there with my sister for enjoying a nice lu "
"we took the alliance four course menu. the portions are quite small and we found that not all the tastes came out of the different dishes being served. the waitress drowned my first course of north sea crab with the green herb dressing. there was little taste of the sole in the second course, although the truffle sauce was quite delicious. the third course was a bit of a disaster for my wife as she found buckshot in the hare. this was explained away as being risk of the trade. not something you would expect from a restaurant of this standard. the cheese trolley was excellent and with a glass of good port made up for what for us was quite a disappointing experience."
"we had diner with *dining with the stars* in this 2 star michelin restaurant. the service was ok. one girl was really friendly we sat out on the terras with a marvelous view. the sun protectings were white and very dirty, should me replaced immediately. the small tables should be vernised as the are ba "
this is a friendly and hard working chinese restaura 
we visited this restaurant for my father in laws 60th birthday with friends and family. service was appalling and slow. it has taken over 2 hours and our food has still not arrived. we are almost considering cancelling and moving to another restaurant. when asked the staff don’t seem to care that we have been waiting for so long. this has left us hungry and not in a great mood for a celebration. would not recommend. 
"we visit goedereede quite often, as we have a holiday home near ouddorp. this establishment had a great reputation before, when there was a german owner. but since they changed owners you can see a difference in quality and servi "
"we ordered the menu of that day: mussels. unfortunately they were overcooked, and therefore a bit watery, and lacking in taste. also i found some broken mussel shells, a no-no because of the risk of food poisoning. nice location, good service, but food not what we expected."
"nice for a stop , lunch or small bite when touring the area. good view of the ancient harbour now obsolete and the village square."
"we stopped on our way for a break and decided on a stroll through goedereede, a small town which has many listed buildings in its centre. pleasant atmosphere, and especially so because the sun was o "
"the spot, close to the small harbor, makes it a perfect place for drinks and sit and watch the boats go by. we had hoped more from the dinner, it was quite average and the fish dish (small soles) was not sufficient for an adult eater. service is friendly though."
"very convenient for lunch or diner when you have your boat at the harbor of bornzwaag. they have a varied menu with emphasis on fish and meat dishes. the lamb curry was good, but not at all spicy. a good wine selection."
"a cozy, comfortable place to enjoy the outdoor terrace. we ordered a few drinks and an appetiser. the drinks were warm and the appetiser was pretty bad, it seems to be from a frozen package. a deep fried item called biterbollen; we have had these all over the area and these were by far the worst. they werent very hot and were doughy and bland. after that, i would not return for anything but the view.

"to be fair, we ended up in this restaurant on the worst night possible, carnival with the local party tent right next door. the restaurant was filled with drunk customers all dressed up for carniva "
good food but limited choice if you are staying for a week or more. opens very late (11am) so not ideal if you like a breakfast. 
"we are travellers from the terspegelt camping and just came from the minigolf and want to snack somthing with our two kids. it took a while untill the service came to our table. we ordered the beverages and asked for the menu, because there weren‘t any around there. time goes by and after 15 minutes the beverages were delivered (by friendly service) but no menu-we asked again for i "
"lovely ambiance, clean kitchen and fine servic "
"i kept giving this place a chance as the food is good, and after our tenth visit we had to give up on the staff who kept ignoring up to the point we had to keep walking over to the bar during dinner. maybe they’re understaffed but it felt a bad taste after we’d spent so much money in there over the past year. it’s now off our list sadly."
on my way to eindhoven i stopped here for dinner with my partner several days a 
old inn lies in between nature. characteristic interior. good food. friendly opersonel. we often go there in spring and summer.
"expectations were high but unfortumately the restaurant did not met the expectations. the staff was good but very informal. the wait for the food was very long. the bar was occupied by non-restaurant guests so it was like you had dinner in a bar in stead of a restaurant. the food was good, the presentation was good but the portions are small. price range quite high. lets say an average of € 35 per couvert. a lot of loud people where it seems that everyone knows everyone. an incrowd place and not very inviting for outsiders. an end result with a 6. just ok."
"we planned to visit this restaurant for the lunch but as we saw theres a lot of people going inside, we cancelled it and chose other place. the building of the restaurant was former manor house and the town hall of middenbeemster."
i sat waiting for 20 min. went to the bar and told to sit and wait. switched to dutch and the very rude bartender was so apologetic. we left without eating.
"best to avoid. service very slow, poor & food terrible - totally overcooked. ordered poached eggs. like plastic. informed by staff that the eggs were poached earlier then reheated in the microwave when ordered. eggs nearly bounced off plate and were tough. spinach also re-microwaved. resulted in green slimy mush. not feeling the bubbliness of this place."
"ordered the lobster royal roll, more fancy looks than taste. thin layer of none fresh lobster on top of a lot of veg. i would recommend this only for people who want a good instagram picture, because it was visually pleasing but not to please your belly."
"really disappointed with the value of a meal here. ordered a lobster and egg “roll”. 26€. two small lobster claws and two small pieces of knuckle meat (see pic below). it really did look pitiful. service was very slow, with four servers standing around. really needs an overhaul. would not go here again. "
"dirty, untidy and shabby. what happend with this bar?? chair were duck-taped, tabels broked, tabels not cleaned, food on the chairs. this used to be a desant place to visit. sad."
…….topped off with laziness! 4 (four) waitresses/ waiters behind the counter. asked for a glas of wine. (named) they just looked at the wines- said nothing.  one found it “ 9€” stone faced.  ams needs a proper wine bar.
"what a terrible experience. you have to stand in line to get your order first, than look for a table and bring the number on a stick so its easy for the waiter to find you (.. "
disgusting. service confused with all order wrong. platter minimalist and not worth the price. also not served with bread and sauces. avoid this place

"i was looking for a spot to grab a coffee and a snack to do some work during my 9hr layover. the airport is empty and so is bubbles. im on a call therefore i find a spot and proceed to finish an urgent email i have to send. i grab the menu and see from the corner of my eye that the older blond lady who tends to the counter approaches the man sleeping in the seat next to me. she goes close to him and yells: would you like to order to wake him up and proceeds to tell him that this isnt a room. the man apologizes for falling asleep but the woman continues to be extremely rude and tells him to just leave. she comes up to me ( while i have the menu in my hands deciding if i want a tea or a coffee) she rudely asks me if i want to order. i start telling her yes ... and she cuts me off to say that this is a restaurant and i cant just be here. i look at her , shocked, and tell her that i was going to order but as she didnt seem to want people in the area, i told her i was going to but seeing her attitude id rather lea "

"in transit we sat here for a drink, it is well set out with large areas between tables for people to move around with luggage. there is a large saltwater fish tank at the entrance, which looks great, and can keep children amused. there is a good selection of food and wine but it does have the typical airport price to items."

"this bar used to be better, i transfer in ams a few times a year. today for €30 i got an over-oxygenated brut reserve and a three slices of gravad lachs that probably lied in the chilled counter for ages since they didnt taste of much and were on their way to a second death. pity, the staff were very nice."
"meal deal of a gravalax sandwich and glass of chablis is good. but the actual product is pretty poor. this is a self assembly deal where you make the sandwich yourself and at this price i would expect the sandwich to be prepared for me. instead you get a dry roll, solid almost frozen butter, gravalax ( nice), a piece of lettuce and a tub of something with no flavour. self assembly? real "
i made my queue waiting to be serv 
"this place is more premium positioned than the other restaurant at schiphol, both in options as well as prices. i like to have that option. i like to pay a bit extra, but it would be nice if the service and quality would actually reflect that, which is not the case. service is mediocre at best, feels like a mcdonalds. quality is okay-ish, wines are terribly expensive. could be better. "
"i’m regularly treating myself on a seafood platter with a glass of white wine here. it’s not the cheapest option yet as i like seafood a lot and this place serves relatively nice and fresh plates, i’m a returning customer. service is typically quick yet as everything is prepared fresh, i’ve also watched some queues building up every once and a while. nice high tables, seafood bar tables or low tables with comfortable seats."
"last week had a perfect fresh equal meal. today the sashimi and sushi was really bad. it was dried out and kept too long for sale. the rush did not make me return, i had to eat something. the served wine in the sushi deal is splendid tough. please wine bar, either just sell wine or make sure you present quality for €45"
"great, we have a delay so let’s go for some seafood. once seated(i am disabled)my husband went to collect the menu. no menu, please come to the counter and place your order. not so easy with a wheelchair and all the luggage....😢 no flexibilty from the staf. what a disaster. four trips to the counter my husband decided finally to order. the two meals we decided to order where wrongly delivered. omg can anything go right today? the only thing that went well was the wine, very expensive😉. are you disabled, blind, deaf, or otherwise not mobile? do not bother coming here, it is a disaster."
the food & wine are good and fresh. the place is comfortable and makes the waiting period a good. the staff may be unpleasant sometimes when you order.
"avoid this place , there are plenty of beautiful and much better assorted restaurants in this airpor "
i just can’t begin to say how disappointed i w 
"resturant was quite full and is close by c gates, interesting place to have a seafood bar. actualy it is sort of a selfservice and very pricy with small portion of susi (3maki + 3sushi -all tuna) for 18 euro, tuna sushi/ sashimi - same 3/3 for 24 euro, glass of white wine for 11 eu "
i like the pleasant retreat steps away from chaos ( although it can too become chaotic at rush hour) but i have seen the quality of fish products offered go down over tine. and today was the worst with very dry or excessively salty fish. very disappointing. 
the seafood is good. but the portions are very small and the service is bad. the waitresses run around as if its their first working day and have not yet learned to smile or say than
"bubbles seafood and winebar offers champagne and wine together with seafood. white wine was served at right temperature, seafood bites were fresh and tasted good. there is no service though. you have to line up each time you want to order something. prices are high and yet you get really unfriendly and arrogant service. i bet a good tip is the only way to get a smile out the staff."
"food quality is ok, as well as wine, but the restaurant is not served, so you need to order and pay at the bar  "
your large glass of wine is 185ml. that is a quarter of a bottle. they got 5 large glasses out of each bottle. that is only 150 ml. when challenged i was told  thats what a large glass looks li 
"you can enjoy a really nice seafood lunch or dinner here, complemented by a good glass of wine from a very rich selection. unfortunately, this comes at a price, and it is not always sure you will be able to find a seat after you buy your food..."
"the food quality is very good, but 20+ euros for 2 maki and 4 niguiri is a bit high. another annoying fact : the (white) wine is served way too cold. and putting a montrachet bottle in daylight and vertical position should be a penal infraction !"
"bubbles between terminals b and c at schiphol airport looks modern and inviting. ordering with the young staff is the first unpleasant experience: arrogant, like they are doing you a pleasure helping you rather than vice versa (the nespresso shop feeling). sushi was dry, not fresh with rice like a brick. price far too high, even high for airport location. try not to go there."
"the changing colour display is really an eyecatcher. even we didnt eat sea food, we stopped for a drink."
"i got an expensive sushi of poor quality, both for the fish and rice. the fish was very cold and had almost no taste. positive: at least there was the low salt soja"
i was quite happy with my sushi. nothing special but ok if you are hungry. my boss didnt like his sushi. the rest was ok. service not too friendly.
unfriendly service. server spilled champagne. did not even bother to clean up. bread was the cheapest white bread. there is no concern for good service because they are all tourists leaving the country.
"had a sushi which was like any supermarket sushi. dry, boring and expensive - 9 pieces for 22 euro. so no, no place to return to."
bubbles is located in a relatively quiet area of the airpo 
pretty much as others have described it. the food is decent and above usual airport fodder. nicely presented. the wines are also of decent qualit 
"service is very much turn-around-oriented, a true airport restaurant... quality of food is good, but service and overpriced menues restrict me giving more than 2 points."
"i visited this place several times. the service is good and the food is fresh. the price is too high for what you get, no balance!"
"i am a regular visitor of the schiphol airport and also of the bubbles bar. i love oysters and fresh sashimi and a decent glass of wine. it is all for sale in bubbles. unfortunately the service is very slow, not very friendly. although the prizes are over the top the bar/brasserie is understaffed and as a result the seats and tables are more often uncleaned than fresh and good lookin "
"is the best place to kill some time, however dont order sushi here. totally overpriced and the rice is thick fatty and watery...."
"i had a couple hours to kill, so i stopped by to have sushi. the sush was tasty, but the staff i encountered was the probably the worst i have ever encountered in all of netherlands. i asked for a table, and she insisted i get take-away. for some reason, the staff yelled everything back to me as if they thought i had a hearing problem or understanding english. it was the most frustrating dining experience. writing this review so i remember never to return next time i am in th terminal."
if you have to spend time at schiphol then this is the best place to eat. there is little ambience but there are a wide range of seafood dishes and a good range of (somewhat expensive) wines. the sushi is generally very fresh and relatively well prepared. the queues at the counter can get long so be sure to allow enough time so you dont miss your flight!
had a few hours to kill in schiphol airport so i decided to try out the bubbles seafood and winebar. i had recently read about it in klms inflight magazine where it got rave revie 
"after eating my maceral sandwich, which was very nice, i noticed two mice running around under the tables. its absolutely disgusting and unhygenic. when i complained the staff seemed to know about the mice. i would not eat there again, who knows what has been running around all over the food?"
seafood restaurant in an airport before security. we were staying in a hotel near by and decided to try this place. it is fine. i ordered wrong and didnt enjoy my meal. my husband got the fish and chips and that was good. tables are bar height. staff was friendly. prices are fair for seafood in an airport. we would eat here again.
"great location in the plaza, near the front windows.  selection of fried and fresh seafood.  tasty and quick.  not a lot of space to sit, just takeaway and find a seat."
"i ordered a fish main course with a bottle of water and one espresso. the waiter prepared immediately the espresso before preparing the main course. when i noticed that i would have wanted to have the coffee after eating the fish, she just replied: “oh, sorry”, laughing, and without offering to prepare another at the right moment, unbelievable behaviour. quality of food horrible. i’ll remember this name next time i’ll travel to schiphol just in order to make the mistake to go there again."
"i always eat here when passing through schiphol, however on my latest trip i witnessed some disturbing hygience practices, namely a staff member emptying the bin with the food hygiene gloves still on, these werent changed before going back behind the counter to serve. they also seem to handle money with the gloved hands, why they dont have one gloved hand (the food hand) and one un-gloved hand (the money hand) and regularly wash their hands.? ive seen this in the uk too. people are generally unthinking and disgusting."
"not exactly the best seafood restaurant in holland. but if you need a raw herring fix as youre transiting through ams airport, then this is the only place in the airport you can get i "
"we had a quick dinner here at schiphol. i ordered fried shrimp with rice. the rice was good, which was rather rare in holland. the shrimp was on average but a bit saltier. in general it was a so-so experience."
"had a seafood salad which was tasty, also the oyster was good but too small than i expected. maybe little bit expensive."
"walking from the railway station to the departure hall we decided to take a dinner at this trendy restaurant. we ordered paella 2/5, ikan bali rice 3/5 and a salad 3/5. the service was friendly and efficient 4/5, the furniture trendy high seats and tables 3/ "
we were here yesterday waiting for our flights departure. decided to try the locals herring fish. the food is good though a bit on the high side. you must try the herring and their fish and chi 
really nothing special but quite ok. they offer a quite wide selection of different seafood dishes.  we tried their lunch box and sushi and it was ok.
"in the mood for some seafood, but tired and not interested in a major dinner, we thought this might have some good, fresh offerings without taking a lot of time. it wasnt bad, but more fast food than specialty spot."
"i stopped here for a quick bite before heading on to amsterdam. the service was slow and i waited for over 20 minutes for the food to be ready, despite there being hardly any costumers. the food was nothing special and the salmon was not quite done. i dont think ill be back, theres plenty of other restaurants around to choose from."
"the food is typically dutch, was cooked fresh and was well present "
"i go here often during business office. the staff is friendly, fish is good and the prices are fair for airport standards. would recommend to go here for an affordable lunch or dinner at the airport."
"the crab spread sub was a-okay wasnt the greatest but thats just my taste. a different sauce would have been nicer. the squid rings were quite oily and they were so thin, not much squid and a lot of batter but portion was big. my boyfriend got cod on its own with no chips and it was quite pricey at almost € "
"too expensive, we bought two small fried fish and paid € 15 for it........ € 7.50 per piece for 6 pieces per tray kibbeling"
"there are a number of food places in the amsterdam airport, but this was different. it is a restaurant specifically aimed at providing fresh seafood. i ordered a homemade salmon sandwich and that was pretty good. i would definitely come here again, however it is definitely too expensive. it really depends if you want seafood so much you would pay for the price they offer!"
"everybody is prepared to pay a bit more at any airport (liminal spaces and all), but at happy seafood the price goes way overboard. we had the so-called big portion of kibbeling (deep-fried battered fish). on the plus side, this is kibbeling made from true cod, rather than the cheaper type of white fish often used. on the minus side, a big portion, which in the rest of the netherlands will get you around 300g of kibbeling, at happy seafood is here at most 150g, perhaps less — but at more than double the price! sometimes you pay for the nice seating, but thats emphatically not the case here: the seating area only has small, high tables with barstools that seem to be designed to get people to move on as quickly as possible. at the risk of ending with a terrible pun: at happy seafood, the foods good, the rest is fishy."
"we ordered an eel roll, packed in a small box with plastic cover. the taste was reasonable because you could taste the smokyness of the eel, but the wrap was too soft and the veggies were all mushy. 2 small rolls were almost 8 euros, which is very expensive."
"we went there with the family for a great fruits de mer, previously we visitied this restaurant to see what they were up to and capable of, and this looked then promising. at arrival there was no longer a fruit de mer on the menu. so we asked an they could make one for us. please see the pictures. this was certainly not the fruit de mer we were expecting. the king crab legs were not cooked wel, so these were replaced by normal crab claws. all in all not recommandable. so no fruit de mer in this restaurant. normal the other fish dishes are well."
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
"we went there with the family after a firm forrest walk. the staff was welchmng us very friendly as we arrived with no reservation. the staff presented the menu and the drink were taken. we ordered some starters and some main courses. the starters, a bisque with ginger and the tartar with carpers. then we had some salmon and a venis "
"location and interior looked and felt luxerious, unfortunatelly the rest of the experience didnt come anywhere near this. staff friendly but totally unprofessional. portions extremely small. food nothing special. waiting time between courses far too long, specially since each course could be eaten in two bit "
especially the surroundings makes this 18th century restaurant quite unique. an ideal place for family& friends gatherings.
"i used to love this restaurant: beautiful location, nice food; have been there a few times, also to celebrate special occasions. a couple of years ago we went there to celebrate christmas; it was so nice that any restaurant we have been for christmas afterwards was disappointing. santa was waiting for you outside, you would get a drink at the entrance and be walked to your table in a warm atmosphere; there was music and you could even choose songs; food was excellent. so we decided to go back this year. but there was no santa, no welcome drink, no music and the atmosphere was cold in every single meaning. the table was at the end of a corridor connected to the main door. when it is below zero outside, not very nice place.... food too average for the price. overpriced for what we got. very disappointed. not going back, at all."
service is crap. the waiter cant handle 2 tables at the same time even though the menu card is sim 
"living in heemstede we have tried virtually all restaurants in the neighbourhood that have a reputation for good food but with the summer closing of our favourite restaurant we took our visitors from abroad to groenendaal in the hope that we would be able to say chapeau. unfortunately this was not to be the case. the staff are exceptionally friendly but not able to clarify what a particular dish on the menu is.. what cut of beef for example, and there was no menu in english available. fortunately our guests were favourably impressed with the location which creates a pleasant atmosphere. the food was honestly a big disappointment and i know they can do better as experiences in the past, particularly for lunches, have showen they can do it, but they must be consequent. was this the reason tht it was so quiet?"
"we meant to book this restaurant for our anniversary, with the bongo voucher that we receive "
"let me start by saying that possibly the covid times are not making it easier to provide a 1 star michelin experience, but i nevertheless have been to a few lately that didnt have this level of experien "
"we went to this restaurant a few times twenty years ago & didnt think much of it then. we had given it a miss ever since then but decided to go there last week to see whether things have improved. it is a nice, quiet restaurant set in a small shopping street. we had a three-course meal with tea & chocolates at the end. unfortunately, things havent improved very much in the last twenty years. the food was mundane without any wow factor. even if it did not have a michelin star, the food would have been described as ordinary at best - having a michelin star made it that much worse. the service was pleasant & the restaurant was full, so perhaps it was me that didnt like it. there are many restaurants in the area, both with and without michelin stars, which are infinitely better than cheval blanc, in my opinion. it is a great pity, as the restaurant is located near where we live & hence very easy for us to get to, but i think we will have to wait another twenty years to see whether there is any improvement!"
"we had the deschamps chef menu, and we were just disappointed by the whole experience. the creations are (seem) to simple for a restaurant of this level, not exciting at all. there was also this figure that kind of runs the place, he was a bit annoying, we didnt feel very comfortable with him arou "
"we had lunch outside - lovely location next to the water. terrace heater was on, which was nice. the food is good, but nothing special. the waitress can smile a bit more and should listen more carefully, as we got one of the sandwiches on white bread instead of on brown, as ordered."
"bij bomans is an average restaurant in the small town were we live. not exiting, the styling is okay and the staff is polit but can use a little bit more enthusiasm. both the aspergsoup and salmon were of very low quality, no taste. the saté was good, chicken very soft and the sauce perfect. the tiramisu was okay and the creme brûlée very good."
with a guest at restaurant at bomans settled down for an evening me 
"a nice place to eat out, food and service are good, but not more than average. when with friends, this is a good place"
"another case of style over substance. yes, it certainly looks swish and they have a great set up - what with their little wooden decking set on the canal and their mix of booths and tables inside... however, this place is just so lacklust "
"if you want a good lunch in the centre of heemstede restaurant bij bomans is a place i can recommend. although it is located in the middle of the city centre, it is a quit location. you walk down some stairs and end up next to a small river. i had shrimp croquettes which were very nice."
"out shopping with my wife and daughter i wanted to treat them to a 3 course lunch. we sat down and got the menu. the waitress asked what we wanted to drink and i asked for the wine list to order a nice bottle. can i have a glass of tap water in the meantime asked my daughter, who needed to take a pill. that was not possible, we had to buy a whole bottle. of course it is possible that a young, overeager waitress does not realise we were going to spend €120 or more on food and wine and tried to sell water. but i wrote to the management and they did not reply. of course we left without ordering and went to the pastabox across the road"
"the two of us dropped in to dinner yesterday. the restaurant was more than half full & has a pleasant ambiance as it is set up like a sitting room in a house. we ordered lots of snacks (tapas) although some of them are a far cry from the genuine spanish article. nevertheless the food is quite tasty and relatively inexpensive. we got the feeling that it was not quite up to the mark as in past visits to the restaurant. the service was friendly & attentive. here are three wines that are served by the glass, all quite pleasant & not expensive. the tuna & salmon dish were the best."
the tapas are not very good quality and far too expensive for what you get. staff friendly but not very professional. not recommendable.
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.
"restaurant is very conveniently located for locals to walk to dinner rather than drive. food of decent quality (but would not use the superlatives i see in other reviews), which for us was what we where looking for. price was on the high side for the achieved level of the foo "
a small restaurant in the middle of the mainstreet of the village. make a reservation. good food list with meals you expect. the meat dish liver is perfect. ask for a table not to close to the entrance.
"its as if the staff walk around actively trying to avoid getting into contact with customers. ive waited for 10 minutes, 3 servers walked by and none of them even said as much as hello. ive walked away from their terrace for the second time in a few weeks now. this used to be a fantastic restaurant. good food, good ambiance. sadly, they seem to have slipped. "
"it was nit easy to ret to the restaurant, but once there it was a nice place the sushi was ok, a bit over average the staff was frindly and helpfull ordering sushi was easy and it came quickly"
"we have had dinner here a good number of times over the past few years but our last visit was disappointing. the hot food was good but the sushi was a mixed bag, with the nigiri being decent but the rolls very poor, tasting mushy and anything but fres "
"this is a big restaurant, with lots of guests. they served the food very quick "
"i visited a friend in assen, she booked this restaurant. its large amount for me, and plenty of bread,my friend ordered pizza it was alright, but there are too much sauce in my lasagna. service is nice and tiramisu cake is great. i er not to common whether its authentic since it relates to different perspectives. overall it was an okay experience."
"the most important step in pizza preparation is to make a soft and elastic dough. it sounds simple but its really an art. unfortunately, chefs of bella italia didnt master this craft therefore i have to rate the pizza as an average. and i am still quite kind to the "
good food but a little too commercially orientated. the restaurant was packed on a tuesday. i got seated at a table that was in the middle of the path the waiters used to get to the kitchen. there shouldn’t have been a table there. i would compare the food to a happy italy but you’ve got a couple more options and it’s a little more expensive.
"busy for a weekday. enough staff to serve all the guests, we lost count of the number of waitresses/waiters coming to our table. nice food, but both pizza and calzone were very salty. the calzone was mostly crispy crust."
"just come back from a weeks stay in assen and we had to visit bella italia twice! the first visit was just myself and my wife we both had yummy pizza ( no 46) thin crust, loads of toppings and the size of a small family car wheel! what’s not to like about that, we sat inside which was a bit of a mistake as it was very warn but all in all a nice eveni "
had pizza here and couldn’t fault the food. we ate outside on a hot day and the flies were all over. very annoying. would definitely recommend to eat inside on a hot day
"ordered a scaloppa ala gorgonzola as a take-home dinner. there was absolutely no gorgonzola on our plates. we ate it because i didn’t want to drive into town again, but i sent a message to the restaurant. no answer. then i sent a mail to the restaurant. so far, no answ "
"went with family and friends on a warm summers evening in august 2017. we sat outside, sharing our corner with a friendly cat  "
we went with a friend whi goes there oft 
"restaurant was busy but had plenty of staff. quick to take order but slow to deliver. waitress was wondering aimlessly with drinks on a tray , eventually caught her eye and managed to rescue wine, when meal came the lasagne was poor lot of pasta but short on filling and very bland, spag bol not much better lot of spaghetti but very little bolanaise sauce. quick to take payment for the meal but still waiting for my change - luckily not much - will not use this place again."
"food is ok but not brilliant. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. thought the pizza was too greasy. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. location good though on the market, normally quite a few people eating there due to affordability. next door is better."
visit the place on a fridayevening with my girlfriend. crowded: reservation is recommend 
we were quite a large group on 2 tables. we were put under a canopy and offered blankets or at least some were. the table i was on put the order in about 10 minutes before the other table and guess who got there meal first. yep you guest the other tabl 
its a large restautant and the tables are place very close to eachother. the choice of pizza and pasta is enormous. the portions are big. we had a starter and couldnt finish the pizza.
we came for an early diner.  the service is good and quick. the food self is good though its a small portion.
"ive gotten pizza here twice and i can say that these are the worst pizzas ive ever had in my entire life. frozen oven pizzas at the store are more enjoyable than this, it feels like they make the pizzas with cheese and tomato sauce then just dumb a bunch of ingredients on there reheat it and done....."
massive size pizza and thats where the meal went downhill soggy in the middle and tasteless  everything out of a tin  asked for piquant and struggled to find a chilli overpriced and poor
"im not sure what went wrong this time. this restaurant has expanded its seating capacity without the proportinal expansion of kitchen capacity. the result is that the service is slow and clearly the staff are weary of the stress placed upon them by this imbalance. we waited nearly an hour for the starter, after asking again for it. another long delay before we invoked the five minute rule and then got up, asked for the bill for what we had had, paid and left. down the road is the el nil, excellent shoarma, served within seven minutes of our arrival!"
"i come here multiple times a year and usually i enjoy the food. tonight was below anything ive ever seen. i got served a well done steak that should have been rare. i sent it back. the second steak was a pathetic thin piece of meat, that was obviously put straight from the cooler on the grill. it was dead cold. i was the only person in the group who wasnt eating, yet the waitress manages to completely ignore this. she even goes so far as to come to our table to ask if i want anything to drink. about 45 minutes later, when clearing the table she asks was it not to your liking?... no, i always leave my steak untouched on the plate... the chef didnt wish to come because he was too busy with the other 3 tables. i left and i wont come back. "
food is all inclusive as are drinks but is of a poor quality.  our kids had to go out and get takeaway pizza ... golf was fun though!!!!
"we are here for world championship of paracycling and we meet here our attest, drinking a good espresso on the terrace of this very elegant place ..."
"went there because lodged at the hotel & tripadvisor rating. the dining room has more than 100 tables, only 7 or 8 were occupied. more than 7-8 waiters around. 22 people seated, more than half an hour to bring me a di "
"the hotel has a number of dining options, one of which is a popular buffet option. only in the weekends and busy, so we made reservations (6 peopl "
"mails prepared and served very quickly, so maybe somewhat prepared in advance, nevertheless it tasted oké"
"the restaurant is located in the hotel, near a motorway exit. the restaurant is child friendly, as they have a special corner where kids can play. the food is average, nothing exceptional but typical dutch cuisine. we had fish, which was prepared ok. it is served with some french fries, potatoes and vegetables. there is a salad bar, with all kinds of different sala "
"the menu is traditional, offers a fairly good selection of dishes. staff is friendly and efficient. although the restaurant is fairly large, the restaurant is divided into smaller sections creating an intimate atmosphere."
"we didnt really want to have dinner at the van der valk hotel but on mondays a lot of restaurants in assen are closed. someone told us the food at the hotel was really okay, which is what made us decide to have dinner the "
in this part of europe hotel restaurants are more interested in giving you a filling meal that is good value for money rather than delighting the senses. meals in the van der valk hotel assen are served in a large charmless room with the window seats commanding views of the motorway and industrial estate but then no one would come here for a culinary adventure or a romantic tryst. 
"after going past most restaurants in town, that were closed, a bank holiday, we finally thought about van der valk. this used to be known for cheap food and large portions, (trucker portions they would be called), but not very fine, dining, just simple good meals, to everyones taste. but since they were a hotel, we were sure they would be open. we went there and the restaurant was nice, entirely newly decorated, well upgraded from the family rooms, it used to look like. also the running stressed students were gone and the staff seemed less temporary and very friendly and professional. the restaurant was full. as we did not have a reservation, we were lead to a side restaurant, which looked like a buffet restaurant, as it had a huge (empty) fixed buffet facility. we ordered, and though the restaurants were all full, it took longer than normal there, but still came in a relatively timely manner. the menu has become more a la mode. we ordered and enjoyed our meal, but all concluded, that it was better they stick to their simple good meals instead of making complicated mixes of different cultures in one plate and nothing really having a nice authentic taste. also gone were the large varieties of vegetables and potatoes : boiled, fried, mash and french fries, and though not ordered the mayonnaise ( a must with chips on a dutch table) was charged separately, which seems odd for a facility like this. prices had also gone up. the décor is nice and i believe this is a good place for a family meal ( with kids), on the move or other reason to have a quick meal, but no longer, an inexpensive one, but then, the netherlands, compared to germany, france, and the uk, is very overprices when it comes to dining out in general, we believe."
"we made a reservation in advance as the guidelines state but once in the restaurant no real visible precautions to be seen. we decided to have dinner inside as the terrace was pretty crowded with a lot of people smoking. the staff is willing to help but to be honest i was shocked what i saw that night, as we had a table near the open kitchen and workingspace. we have seen people collectieve their own spoons as staff forgot to bring them each time, people collecting their own beer, people asking for a menu as they were waiting for a long time already and people leaving after an hour and a half when they found out their main course order was lost in the kitchen. we ourselves had to wait quit some time but we received everything we ordered. the only thing was the repeated question on which rice/noodles we wanted. once given the girl managed to bring us the wrong dish three times stating that she did not know what fried rice was although it is in the menu. yes it was a busy evening but there was enough staff present, problem was that there was nobody in charge and there was just not enough experience present managing a restaurant. i definetely would not advise this restaurant if you want to have dinner on time, if you get any at all."
we visited this place when it was recently open 
"the restaurant is ideally located to visit after a long walk; most of the visitors were also doing that. food was o, but really special. service was a bit inexperienced."
"bij sib is quite a new restaurant in emmen. we went there for dinner with the family, and although the food is really really good, there are definitely a few things that can be improved. for example, it took quite a while before someone came to take our order for drinks, the same happened with the food. on top of this, we had to wait long before we received our food. it wasnt possible to order tap water (only mineral water, which we, of course, had to pay for). the menu was not really readable, and it looked like some random dishes were put on the menu, without thinking of an overall theme. the fact that the food was really good and the staff was very friendly definitely improved our experience. therefore, i hope that the things described above will be taken into account and hopefully improved by the restaurant, because they have the potential to become one of the better restaurants of emmen!"
"good atmosphere, good service, reservations recommended on friday and saturday. not a bad eating experience, my wife had the pork kabob with ribs, which were good. meats were served on a bed of mashed potatoes with bits of spinach leaf, well presented. meal came with french fries, a salad and another potato dish (not baked). couldn’t quite determine the spice used on the second potato dish, but wasn’t to my liking. a baked, with sour cream and chives, potato would have been better. i had the ribeye, which, unfortunately was not available, but the house was gracious enough to substitute a t- bone at the same price. t-bone was a healthy size, and cooked to my request, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. questioned the waitress and found out that the meats have very little fat content, presumably the reason for being chewy. my recommendation to the cook would be to use a bit of meat tenderizer in the future. also wouldn’t hurt to marinade the steak in either a1 or hp sauce for a few hours for some additional flavor. had i ordered the t-bone at its full price i would have been disappoint "
"we were just the 2 of us, my brother and me. he had the spicy ribs and i had the steak. the steak was fine, it was of good quality but the pepper sauce looked and tasted like it was the kind where you just add water and serve. terrible. the vegetables were virtually non-existent and pretty blan "
"the restaurant and food are fine. menu is mostly what to expect from a wok. the food used to be better in my opinion. the drinks are ordered and delivered to the table, so you can focus more on eating."
"this restaurant is just fine. if you want to eat a lot for a relatively small amount of money, you should go here. the food is good, there is a nice atmosphere and you get good value for your money. its not great are amazing, but just fine. "
what can i say i will not be going ba 
"i would only save the deserts.  wok is fine, ingredients not so good. sushi a bit dry. doesnt have many choices."
"good for dutch standards. its a small restaurant, cozy and intimate for a romantic dinner. they have decent meats and a good menu in general."
"having been here a few times, i was surprised that the restaurant was listed no. 22 of restaurants in emmen when it could be a lot better then that. almost all ingredients are there, but the right recipe has not been found yet. location is not bad, and the place has a very nice feel to it. we were sitting outside in a spacious aria at the front of the restaurant. drinks were served quickly. so, the setting was there. but what was missing ? hmm perhaps that the food was just good, nothing special. meat ( rib roast ) a bit dry, and the tomato soup was almost a diluted pasta sauce. too creamy and cheesy. but all in all, not bad at all. the service was kind and helpful but during dinner they left the table unattended for too long of periods. i guess the place just needs a bit more professionalism. paying a bit more attention to details. taking away used plates quicker, and come by a bit more often to check for drinks. so, could be better, but 22nd is certainly not deserved !"
"business dinner with a colleague. we order to pizzas, nothing spezial. i was expecting more. maybe i made the wrong choice, because the restaurant was full in a thursday evening. some families and couples around.  nice decoration and service. everybody speaks fluent english."
had a seafood pizza. was nothing to get excited about. was expecting a little more that average with such a high rating. beer was flat but saw them pouring the beer and adding old beer from a glass to top it up.
"we ate there one year ago and it was without doubt the best dinner out that i ever had in emmen. we went back there some days ago and it was really disappointing. we had the surprise menu. maybe it was just bad luck, but the food was really average. no fantasy, meat, fish, meat, pickles and speck everywhere. and the cake was pretty old. the service was friendly but the guys were clearly beginners. in my opinion you cannot serve with long pink nails and white adidas, it just doesnt fit the ambient, which is supposed to be elegant. it would be a 2 star review, but, once again, i think it was the wrong night and i give 3. the restaurant, still, has the potential to excel and i hope that next time is gonna be as it should."
this a indoor swimming pool and nothing more than that. we visited this pool i think 10 times and for the kids its nice
i went here a few times. first of all i have the feeling it does not get better. furthermore i dislike the fixed prices. i went here with my pregnant sister and when she wanted to replace the more expensive beef with the much cheaper giros meat (as that is not good during the pregnancy) she was still forced to pay the same. some guests also got a free ouzo but not all.... that is not very nice. all together a rather average experience.
the plates of the main course where full of meat as is normal in greek restaura 
"they say its the best greek in town, but thats not hard with only 2 option "
"nothing special, weve been to worse but weve been to a lot better greek restaurants. we prefer to drive to meppen germany and have à greek meal there, so munch better!"
"i must say that because i was the only one who did not enjoy my meal, reflects more on me than the hotel. having said that, i had the duck and was not pleased with the taste. i wish there had been more choices on the menu, perhaps some chicken. i also did not like the vegetarian options for my sister, as she cannot eat mushrooms. she had the special which she guessed would be whatever was left in the fridge, as it was the chefs creation - and she was correct. however she enjoyed it. my mother enjoyed her sirloin, and my grandparents enjoyed their food too. so maybe it was just me! the staff was very attentive and helpful, especially with my aging grandfather. i was not left impressed by the menu choices, but otherwise it was a pleasant evening."
food taste and quality is 8/ 
"usually its really nice having sushi here bit this time it was a bit mediocre. didn’t get a lot of what we ordered and i don’t know what they did to the soy sauce but it was horribly salty. will go again though as it’s the first time in years i was a bit disappointed. usually nice fresh sushi, quick service and very reasonably priced"
"im not used to high end sushi, but this was a new low. the sushi was uninspired, dull and sloppy.  it is one of the cheaper all you can eat options out there, but the price is so low for a reason."
"after traveling to spain numerous times and enjoying real tapas this place really shouldnt call their food tapas. it is the oddest thing the way they have you choose two items at a time (per person ) and they bring them out then you order two more, so you always waiting for your fo "
interesting idea to serve tapas-like portions of a very wide selection of food and preparations. enjoyable environment. execution is reasonable. in view of the menu i expected more variety in tastes. except for a few items i found most to be a bit bland.
we did arrive early and our table was not available after a telephone call more than a week ago. i did order a red wine and my partner a glass of tonic. he than did ask for a slice of lemon which should be standard when ordering tonic. after 10 min i personally had to ask for the return of the glass including lemon. we decided not to eat. that was a very quick in and out. pity if you are frequent visito 
"if you expect tapas as you know them, dont go there. this restaurant invented a whole new concept of the small spanish dishes. these are micro dishes, not remotely spanish, most of them with the same tomato tapenade. some bites - as i prefer to call them - were all right but others were tasteless and without any fantasy. for instance the undercooked prawns or the 2 tiny slices of courgette with a wallop of the tapenade that dresses most dishes.. service was as marginal as the food. the beer was excellent! and its very close to the station."
"the restaurant is very customer friendly. deco is also nice and simple. but the food is often unstable of quality. sometines its really good, but most of the time very average. the prices are some what high for the unsteadiness of the quality. but the staff is very nice and deserves second changes. the delivery services are not up to par for the asking price. i will recommend to visit the restaurant."
i had a dinner at restaurant sorrento with a friend. it was during the week and around half of the available tables were occupied. after ordering it took quite some time before we got our dinner served. the food is average. i was not impressed with the service staff. the wine is quite expensive and very few wines to choose from. the pinot grigio tasted to sweet for me. i was expecting the lemon-citrus flavo 
"delicious sushi restaurant in the city center. 2,5 hours unlimited choise of food (with some exceptions like sashimi, dessert, all drinks and some other stuff you have to pay extra). however its rather expensive in comparison with other all you can eat restaurants, sushi and rolls are absolutely delicious. "
"not so good! standard sushi and everything is flavoured with sesame sauce, all tastes the same. would not go here again"
i wouldnt openly pay the €26 for the food as its not overly what i would eat so its a lot of money for a limited amount for me. if you were daring and enjoy all the food then it would well be worth it. meat done on the grill was lovely. would be better if they had english descriptions on the food also. guessing was a bit to brave for me. love the fact all drinks are included thats very good. 
great for a quick bite to eat with friends or for large gatherings. there is something for everyone. it just isnt my scene. i feel like i am sitting in the school cafeteria.
ever since this restaurant has a new owner the quality of the food has dropped to an all time low. we all had a stomachache after eating here. too many choices and everything is self service without much supervision. this used to be a good chinese wok restaurant but not much of that is left.
"the first course consisted of a board to share. cheeses, ham, delicious mushrooms. but who in the kitchen thought of tiny pieces of smoked salmon in a small piece of cold wrap? not tasty at a "
my husband and i thought this would be a nice place to have something to drink. the waitress asked if we had a reservation but it was not a problem and said we choose a table in the back. i sat down and husband went to the toilet. i was waiting to be asked what i wanted to drink. but was totally ignored by several waiters they looked at me and continued talking amongst each other and one them even went to the bar and had audacity to have a drink at the bar. only when my husband returned the waiter came to set the table and take the order. just to make it clear i am dutch-indian origin and my husband is real dutch therefore caucasian. i assume i was not good enough to be recognized as a person and only my husband was as he is white skinned. so sad that that there are still people like this in the world.
"the setting is cool, that is what invited us in but now we know bett "
nice place with lovely views. spacious and bright restaurant with some outside space looking up to a harbou 
"this restaurant is a short walk from batavia outlet. it overlooks lelystad harbour and rather nice both in summer when the terrace is open and in the autum. the waitresses are friendly. it has a modern ambiance. the waitress accidently split the beer which did splatter the jacket. they offered to pay the dru cleaning bill. uitsmiljters were ordered which were fine. unfortunately the menu for lunch is rather small and not much to choose from. the plus point is if you park in the underground parking, they give you a parking card to drive out instead of paying the normal parking fee. definitely better than eating at the outlet,"
"ive been here a couple of times now and i truly believe it is a hit or miss situation here which largely depends on the mood of the staff that day. we popped by today for a latte and a cup of coffee. today wasnt our day, staff was cranky and eager to dismiss us as soon as possible. in addition for the prices i would expect a real latte. this was a machine pumped watered down cup of something that somewhat resembled a latte in taste. hubbys coffee was at least better than sludge he said. so in general if you want to pay too much for a limited menu, crappy service with a nice view then you should pop by de rede. will we go again? oh probably as location is ideal. ps dont even bother asking if any of their coffee drinks can be altered slightly, it all comes pre-made in a machine."
the food was nothing special. only the sateh was pretty good. waiters forgetfing the drinks and took almost 30 minutes before someone came for ordering the food. it was not very busy.
"the second rede we tried after rede in dronten. its location is nice, with view of water and boats. food is good as usual. the service is great. we always have good time at de rede."

"good service, mediocre lunch offering, better dinner options. nice view over the marina. we were there for lunch and it was rather quiet but i can imagine it is a vibrant place at night when all people from the boats come in for dinner & drinks. should be nice!"
i visited this restaurant while staying in lelystad. i had some mixed feelings on my vis 
this harbor restaurant is a bit out of the way but the tasty dishes are a good reason for the 5 min drive out of the city centre. the interior is surprisingly modern and cozy. the staff is friendly but needs some more experience.

"there were mice scurrying around us in the dinning area of the hotel, first one, then two and then three. i am not at all squeamish about mice but this is a health hazard where people are eating and in a 4* hotel. when i, and other guests, brought it to attention of the staff, they were not at all concerned saying that ‘it’s an old hotel’ ‘you can leave if you wish’. unbelievable."
"we had not planned dinner for the night and decided to go try out this well-rated restaurant inside the 4 star hotel. to begin with, reception did not guide us or show us where restaurant is. in my opinion this is expected in a 4-star hotel. we decided to try out the specialty. sadly, it was below expectations and highly overpriced. finally, the service was weak. waiters and waitresses on phones or busy doing scut work which is irrelevant of serving clients. i do not recommend this dining experience!"
really nice space. service is haphazard. the lounge lies outside the interest zone of personnel. that requires an active drawing of attention or walking up to the bar to order. an elderly man does so and the barman asks rhetorically: “so my colleague has not been over to ask you what you would like to drink

the choices in the menu were very small. if you don’t eat meat or fish you’re not able to eat here. fries didn’t taste well. and the didn’t had the beer on the menu. bad experience.

"we had a very large group and only about half of our group enjoyed their meals. we recommend the aged steak, bread starter, and the lava cake (with caramel!). we do not recommend the eel or other fish starter, bravette, or pasta sala "
basic food presented nicely. would not recommend for the food but the place and location is great. i think you can go here for drinks and snacks.
"a friend who lives here wanted to treat me to a special meal. love the outdoor seatings, service & decors especially the location in the old prison. we had the 4 dishes tasting menu. it was 3 meat and a fish dish. loved the fish and the duck but the starter a ‘steak tartar with raw egg york’ was a no for me. i eat everything except ‘raw meat’, i don’t mind it medium rare but raw with a raw egg york was too much for me. i appreciate the creative ideas. wished there were more seafood and vegetables."

super location- had the surprise menu for 2- 4 courses- 3 meat 1 fi 
"i think after a mention in the michelin guide they are chasing a star. however they need to look at their tactics. the menu is small and very experimental which is fine. however a good restaurant would have a fall back of more standard dishes. even the soup of the day was a cold one. if there is nothing you like the look of then there is no where to go. i had the ceviche and the salad for starter the raw fish was like eating oysters (which i love) but without the fresh taste of the sea and citrus. the salad had everything thrown in and a selection of all the sauces they do of all colours, not particularly enjoyable. my son had the goose which was supposed to come with a different salad but it looked the same to us. it was not much better than mine. we fell back on the dry aged ribeye because of the limited choice. it was okay standard steak, cooked ok. the bearnaise did not taste home made. sitting outside was okay, but no table cloth and the large black plastic numbers stuck on the tables did not help the ambiance. for desert i had the creme brulee which was very nice, and my son the panna cotta which was fine. he had lived in leeuwarden for a year and always wanted to visit this restaurant. he brought me as a treat and was disappointed it did not work out as expected. the service was ok but being one of the few outside we felt we were sometimes an after thought. a very average evening there are better in the town."
"we had nice drinks in the afternoon and reserved for an early dinner in the evening. when we reported reservation was not there but we got the table near the waterside. ordered directly and had drinks, after 30 min. we asked where the food was, sorry the kitchen starts as from 17.30. we had our food at 18.00 and the service was  not very dedicate "

"nice location and inside set-up. average service. got a hamburger and a fish, both not enough cooked."
we chose to have a meal here because my partner wanted to try frisian food. however i dont think the menu is at all frisian. they brought us sausage coated in white chocolate when we arrived. i am vegetarian so my boyfriend ate both. they then brought some bread with tapenade and some olive oil jelly. i am sure frisians are not eating this at home. during this time we still waited for the menu. it seemed odd to wait so long. my boyfriend chose a fish dish and i chose the only veggie opti 
the food was delicious but the wasabi wasnt spicy at all... the system they use for ordering food is super easy  menu is super clear and you can see exactly what u are ordering the tables were a bit small for the three of us
"a typical all you can eat restaurant, where you end up paying the same or more than in a classic restaurant. the decor is nice, attention to detail, the service is friendly, but not all dishes we ordered arrived, even after asking specifically for them. the quality of the dishes is very average. the sushi is like the ones you find ready made in supermarkets: rice that is too cold, fish with little taste."
"staff spoke good english, also had english menus which was nice. there was a slight misshap with our reservation even after 2 phone calls but eventually we got seated. the sushi was good, rest of the dishes were pretty average. would recommend the chicken satay with peanut sauce and the rib eye, both were pretty tasty. waiting time was good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you can get. "
"i was expecting more from this restaurant considering we had to make a reservation in order to eat on a saturday night. what i did not realize until my friend and i arrived, however, was that it is a fixed-price, all-you-can-eat sushi joint and not an actual sushi restaurant. if you are looking for great sushi, this is not the place for yo "
"tao is mediocre at best, its a sushi restaurant for people who have never had sushi before. the staff are not unfriendly or friendly, they just are, like being seved by an accountant.. you fill out want you want to order on a list and you dont get everything but they try and make you pay for all of it. the drinks are overpriced and slow. never again."
the restaurant has a one-choice formula. you can choose five times fives small dishes from the menu for a fair price. after three rondes yill discover that it may be enough alrea 
"it is full even on weekdays, and what i have noticed is that once the popularity was on, the quality of the food went down incredibly. nothing is fresh, and the quality of the fish is very poor. lots of items are frozen and then thrown into the fryer (and absolutely not part of the japanese cuisine). everything is salty in order for you to drink more. and it is not cheap at all! the atmosphere is nice and the service quite good and fast (of course). however not enough for the price they ask."
"this restaurant seems to be enjoying a bit of a hype at the moment but it cant live up to it. we dined at christmas and had to pay extra for a compulsary entree, but it was fish, so those of us that are allergic to fish basically paid for nothin "

"used to come here 3 times a year, this time i came with my girlfriend for a nice diner. we could pick our own table since we were reasonably early. after we sat down the waitress seemed tired or something, anyway we ordered some drink at first and looked into the menu card which had broad options. after decided what to eat we needed to wait 4 minutes for the waitress to notice us. we ordered carpaccio as starter that had some grilled cheese on it (odd combination) which had an overwhelming taste. after that we went for the main course, we took the rib-eye steak and spareribs (kinda cheesy food i know) food was reasonably fast at our table. while eating the waitresses had no eye for us anymore and couldnt get their attention for something to drink so had to wait 10 minutes before we could finally draw their attention. starter couldve been better, main course was nice but the employees werent capable of managing 10 tables with 3 waitresses. i used to enjoy the hospitality of the owner and his big smile but he was working at the bar unfortunately. "
"the only reason to come here is that it is cosy. old fashioned with lots of candles at night. however, the food is not great and the service is much too slow. i would not return. there are better choices out there. there are steep stairs to the bathroom. on the stairwell there is an old fashioned marble sink and a faucet. in the bathroom there are blaring commercials for this restaurant(!?)."
"i was for dinner with the swimming club, on wednesday evening, and there was quite some people around 6pm already having dinner. the place was not big but also not small. food was also ok, but nothing extraordinary."
not bad but not impressive at all. if you want good service and good food this is the place for you. if you expect tipycal holland kitchen you better change address.  wifi was broken. very good kids menu.
the food was nothing special. the spare ribs were very dry. the environment was average. the stuff were friendly and polite.
"alright, this one isnt easy. let me start like this: we wanted to take the tapas all you can eat formula. after a while, we still didnt get any order lists or something alike, so we asked if we could order our food. seemed that the all you can eat part is eating what they give you. you do not have any choice in the matter at all...none of the waitresses gave us an information about the system when we got the menu, nor any descent explanation later from the boss. “we make everything fresh…” don’t they all?! the confusing part is this: nowhere on the menu or on the website they mention that the “all you can eat” formula isn’t free of choice. normally all you can eat is: all you can eat and you pick what you want to eat. i think it is reasonable to assume they work the same way. clearly not… so on to the next choice on the menu: the five tapas formula for 2 persons. here the same problem: you get the most sold tapas of the month, not the ones you want! soooo extremely frustrating. what if the most sold ones aren’t the ones you want?! i mean, seriously…at “la cubanita” you can order anything you want and as much as you like, now that is an: all you can eat formul "
i went there for dinner with coworkers and was totally grossed out. service is super slow. it took almost 10 minutes to get a menu. i only ordered a salad because i wasnt too hungry. when it came i took one bite and before i could take another i found a massive hairball in the salad. the manager offered me something else but of course i refused to eat anything else out of that kitchen. my coworkers said their food was ok but my experience ruined it. the bright side is the manager told me he didnt charge me for the salad...but he did charge me for the drink. 😐 would never recommend anybody eat there. 
the visit was in the back-end of the restaurant with our family. was friendly for our little grand-dougther. the food was not very good - it was ok. the service and attention of the staf can also improve. the overall athmosphere is ok. cosy is the word which is the best description. 
this restaurant was chosen by an opinion gave by the recepcionist from the hot 
"food was very good (presented really nicely, too), but the service was simply bad. waiting times between courses were totally ridiculous. one person who didn’t order an appetizer, waited two hours to be served his first course. when asked (after almost two hours) in a friendly manner if there was a problem in the kitchen, the waitress didn’t show a lot of interest, just said that they wanted to serve the main meals at the same time.... it was not even that busy and there was plenty of staff walking around..."
"i was accompanying my partner for a dinner date he had the planed for. he called to arrange a window view for a romantic sunset dinner, but the staff weren’t sure over the phone. when greeted at the restaurant, the seating was denie "
"a quick note. this review regards our visit to the christmas brunch on boxing day. i have added a half point as it might not exactly reflect their normal quality. however, as a draw for future guests it was an utter fai "
"yes, you can order a lot of tapas here. and yes, some them are great (e.g., spare ribs!). but the pace is soooo slow. we got our first order at the end of the evening. the all-you-can-eat means literally you can eat all you want, but its all about the drinks. even the drinks were not served very quickly. all in all a disappointing experience. but hey: try it for yourselves!"
"this restaurant is located in the centre of leeuwarden, so has a nice view if you sit outside. i would recommend sitting outside, because inside is cramped, dark and extremely warm. the food was ok, there was quite a lot of variety, but the quality really varied per dish. sometimes the dishes came really quickly, and some took half an hour! this makes it hard to predict exactly how much time you will spend at the restaurant. the staff was friendly and the concept of all you can eat tapas is a good one, so all in all an ok restaurant."
"the food was okay, lots of variety but not very good taste. you pay way too much for what you get. was kind of dissapointed.."
"called to get some good food. i heared itwas goodso we called to get some dishes. gado gado with white rice, tofu dish with vegetarian bami, baka bana/ baked bana "
only bad thing was we had to wait 30 mins even though we had ordened tables. food was fair and planty of it at fair prices.
"sushi all-in but the restaurant itself feels more romantic than an all-you-can-eat-concept normally is. it was a very busy night. the food is nothing special, had better sushi (i would recommend tao if you want the best sushi). the waitresses en waiters are friendly, but not very fast. sometimes we got the wrong dish, sometimes they forgot a dish or drink."
"the place is fancy and the waiters too. but the quality of the food is really terrible but its way too expensive, especially taking in consideration that it is an all you can eat and you can order only 3 very tiny portion per person, and moreover it takes ages to be served... absolutely to avoid! way better places where to eat! "
some friends suggested this place. we were in town and decided to try the take out. came home excited to try and we were very disappointed. not much flavor at all in any thing! not sure we want to go back and try the restaurant now. 
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"me and my bf are not big drinkers so we didnt drink much, most of soft drink was unlimited ,and wine, they only have heniken beers. food is kind of simple european food, i like the fries and local bread pudding!"
"2 & 3 course meals, drinks included. not an extensive menu but fair and a bit for everyone. all drinks, including alcoholic right up until your last plate is removed from the table. staff is friendly but didnt have the best english language skills."
"the location, especially the garden at the front was go "
service was good but we were there with a huge group of women and we expected (as the sign said) different bites. the second course waa basically a big bowl of chicken wings. not spanish and 0 inspiration. sad thing. it used to be nice and fun to eat here. this was a shame. 
"i really can not understand why it took so long to get our food, it was a friday night but not at all busy, they got our orders wrong and it was not at all busy, which should have been a sign. the waiter was rude and unapologetic and basically had a crappy attitude. the food was tasteless and it was obvious that the cheapest of the cheap ingredients were used. please do not go to this waste of money. absolutely awful."
"i went to mei wah for dinner. the online presence suggested it should be an interesting place to visit. i do not speak dutch, but they found staff members to talk english with me. the menu was in dutch only, so i did need assistance. one of the staff members, who appeared to be one of the cooks, helped me by asking what type of foods i liked. as part of the discussion, i mentioned that while i like flavors, i do not like overly spicy/hot food. not liking hot food may have been taken literally! in any event, i was recommended a dish called bami super special, on the basis that it met my needs and that it was a favorite for many dutch diners. unfortunately, the food was mostly bland, lukewarm, and in partially congealed sauces. one of the deep-fried items appeared to be freshly fried. the other not. the meal was a disappointment. nobody came to check on me during the meal either."
"wed been looking for a place where we could eat fresh and good sushi for a while. yugo came as a pleasant addition to the relatively basic restaurant scene in sneek. we went in the weeks after it has just opened. yugo, a nicely-designed but reasonably noisy restaurant, goes for a fusion-type mix of cuisines - mostly asian-oriented. theres a great selection of sushi (they do take-out as well) plus small tapas-like dishes. there are two levels you can choose from, based on a number of rounds: standard and deluxe. in a number of rounds (5) you can pick dishes on the ipad on the table. our server tried to explain the procedure, but didnt seem quite sure how it worked either. that wast a good start. neither was the section of drinks: i wanted a special beer - no can do. staff, by the way, were very mostly friendly and helpful. everyone at the table must choose the same level. the deluxe level gives access to more exclusive plates but not to more plate "
"bar and restaurant are good places to be and eat. the bedrooms were large with an in room sink and kitchen cupboards, but no kitchen. we were cold both nights and could not find extra blankets. our toilet demanded that you sit sideways o it,no leg room except if one is vertically challenged. car parking a problem, not insoluble! staff were delightful."

"it seems to be fashionable to eat in dark restaurants lately and the kastanje is no exception, we had to use the torch on the phones so we could see what was on the plate."
"the service was good and the food acceptable: however, the dish called boulibaisse was actually fish and shrimp in a bland red brooth. the spice of the crouton was supplied by two rolls with spicy cheese. i put the bread spread in the bowl with shrimp and fish. no other seafood though there were mussels as an appetizer. disappointing!!! the food was good, but not great and the service good. i asked the waiter why no mussels or clams or squid, and they also seemed surprised. oh well!! not what i would have hoped for!"
"went here last month with two of my friends. wanted to catch a 9:15pm film so we figured that if we’d reserve a table for 6:30pm, we’d have plenty of time for some bread, a main course and dessert. well, we thought wron "
"well, i was with my girlfriend last week. our idea was to have a romantic dinner. for the beginning, we ordered tapas and they arrive 90 minutes later... we finish and then for the main course another 70 minutes. nobody asked us anything, we had to call the staff many times and remember our order. finally, our meat tasted so weird, acid... the result was spending the hole morning the following day in the toilet so... never again. "
"we visited this restaurant for dinner and were amazed by its quaint decorations of religious art - we liked it but not everyone would. we enjoyed excellent starters and main courses, but the desserts were a bit too heavy and sweet for us. we were a bit taken aback by the wine list which offers most wines at high prices. what made the experience less memorable was the service, in the beginning we felt pressured by the waiter but when the time came to ask for the check it took a long time before we could get the staff to notice us again. all in all the meal was not the best value for the high price we paid."

it is a bit weird inside with statues of the virgin mary and jesus abounding and so quirky i suppose is a reasonable description with some outgoing waiters and chefs. so it was unusual. we were also shown examples of the steaks and fish of the day brought round on a plate which was interesting i guess. my wife and i went on the day where the build up to a major sailing week was starting and i think it is a bit like the equivalent of cowes week in england so a fair bit of money floating around the town. anyway the food. it was fine. i had a rib eye steak and my wife a spicy chicken meal (with thai overtones) with rice. the prices are high though and for one course each with two beers and a glass of house white we paid more than two courses and the same drinks at the walrus the night before and i have to say i enjoyed the meal and atmosphere far more there. so in summary we didnt really enjoy the evening but it is just not the sort of place we like i think but it was worth a try and would certainly be other peoples cup of tea. it wasnt short of full tables so it must be fine for some.
"this evening we (a family of 5) stopped by this hotel restaurant because we always enjoy the van der valk menu. however, after being seated we were ignored for 10 minutes. i then went to pick up some menus myself so that we could choose our meals. however, a further 10 minutes passed and we were still completely ignored. we tried to call over a waiter to place our orders but no-one responded. finally we just left and went to another restaurant. so i cannot give a review of the food at this place because we never got any.

"there is place for 300 people i guess and it was almost full. the food is really nice, if they have it. they we out of chicken!!! 😳 the taste of the food was good but the portions were not all equal, some got a small piece some got a huge piece of meat, i would say the double. the tables are too big (for me it is more inportant that i can talk with the person in fron of me than the decoration of the table, that together with the noise make the place not as nice as it could be). but overall was good."

"with me van der valk restaurants conjured up an image of a road side restaurant, where you could obtain a quick lunch or dinner for a reasonable price, with ample food of medium quality. added to the fact that i had not visited van der valk for more than ten years, i was surprised at the nicely appointed big restaurant inside the van der valk hotel in sneek. we dined there on friday evening and saturday evening. if i would only review the dinner experience of friday the review result would have been easily 4 points with something to spare. delicious food, friendly and dedicated service, a superb italian wine and a table in a quiet corner, who could ask for more. so, anticipating another splendid meal, we booked the same table for the saturday evening. however, the experience of this evening was less satisfactory. the entree was ok, but with the main course the problems started. never mind that the person who served us with the main course was very indifferent, almost rude and shoved the dishes on the table on any old spot without taking care that the we could reach the dishes without getting up from the table, but the big problem was the quality of the side dishes. the cauliflower was still frozen; the french fries and fried potatoes were obviously recycled. i really want to believe that food leftovers from the tables are not used again at van der valk but with this experience i start to wonder. we sent it all back to the kitchen of course but we marveled about the difference in quality between the friday and the saturday. also we wondered that those side dishes ever could have been approved in the kitchen. that is why my review is only three points and explains the mixed feelings. one really positive observation i want to share is that every table received fresh linen after it was cleared! this is the standard in italy of course but in dutch restaurants the table linen is virtually glued to the table and gets only a superficial brush down after the table is cleared. high marks for van der valk in this area. the price of the food is of course of the inflated dutch variety, but in moderation. dutch restaurants have the highest prices in europe, but here at van der valk the prices are moderate for dutch standards. conclusion: mixed feelings and hit or miss."
"a week ago, after an excellent dinner and friendly service, we made a reservation for a table for the consecutive sunday. unfortunately we made the opposite experience on our second visit: no table available outside at the time agreed, unfriendly and arrogant behaviour by the « cheffe » (style: couldn’t care les "
"we selected this restaurant based on its high rating in google maps. the service is very good but the pizza is average. the dough is good and crunchy but the topping is disappointing, very little amount of cheese. i was expecting more."
"so disappointed! we had been here before earlier in the year, also on a busy saturday evening, and had a great time. we therefore recommended it to our friends for a return visit. but this time it was very different. half an hour wait for our starters, a further hour for our mains, and we never got our third round of drinks. the food was ok, but an enquiry chasing up our mains got a shrug and an ‘i told you we were busy’. absolutely not good enough. i had hoped to book de domp and de kajuit for a boat rally early in 2024 (15 boats and 50-60 people), that will not happen now."
"went here for wifes birthday on the basis of good reviews on ta. wish we had gone somewhere in the old city instead. staff were not very friendly, service was extremely slow, and staff had to be reminded of drinks order. food was also nothing special, and expensive for what was offered. very disappointing."
"we were here with friends for dinner and ordered tomato soup/mushrooms/shrimp for starters and schnitzel/slibtongetjes/peer/steak for main course. i had the tomato soup and schnitzel. the food was ok, but not special. it felt a bit like traveling back to the 70s. portions are abundant, maybe a bit greasy. staff is very friendly and accomodating. "
"a complete mystery as to how this restaurant is rated so highly. whilst the service was friendly and helpful the food was very mediocre - soggy fish, overcooked, rubbery mussels and a salad bar that appears unchanged since the 70s. im sure its a friendly place for locals or a quiet drink, but i sincerely hope its not the best food sneek has to offer."
"a day out in sneek involves also looking for a nice place for lunch. after visiting the fries scheepvaart museum and the heritage liquor shop of weduwe joustra, it was already high time for lunch; the veranda restaurant onder de linden made an attractive showing. furthermore, the restaurant was still packed with customers, so they must do something right. against heavy odds we found a nice table in a relatively quiet corner. the service of the staff was a bit hectic due to the popularity of the restaurant, however, the waitress was able to give polite service. i opted for the heritage sneeker uitsmijter advertised on the advertisement board outside as an old sneek recipe. what shall i say about the food. as for the sneeker uitsmijter, you can do only so much with fried potatoes, fried onions and eggs, but as it was it was well prepared, a bit like a hearty german breakfast. my travel companion had chosen the soup of the day and bread with a deep fried croquette. she complained about the amount of salt in the soup. although the awareness of the harmful effects of the consumption of too much salt is luckily becoming main stream, many restaurants still put too large amounts of salt in the dishes. tallying the hectic service, the mediocre food and the dutch restaurant prices, i can only award a three point rating."
"nice restaurant. food is good, especially the fish entrees. mustard soup is the best!!! staff was very friendly though service slow. dissapointing deserts."
"decent spanish tapas style restaurant, allbeit the portions are quite big for a “real” tapas experience. fair prices and mostly fresh ingredients. the terrace is right at the roadside, so there could be some cars passing."
"the quality of the food is good for what you pay, the place is nice and you can spend some lovely time there with friends or even for an informal business dinner. i will come back since i liked the concept and the service."
"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
"i put average on my review because of the decor and the friendliness of the staff; however, the culinary experience was not for us a big succe "
"food is average, but prices are not average. overall price-quality not what you should expect. we asked to some tapwater to serve with the desert. this was not possible. this after we drank multiple drinks per person, really not what you expect in a restaurant as a service."
"although my husband, son and friend enjoyeded their food (fish), i had saté. the sauce must have been chucked over directly out of the tub, normally that has to be diluted with milk or water but this was too dark, too thick and too strong. and far too much! the (large size) chips were very dry. the service was ott (over the top), various members of staff came to the table to check on the same thing! as our friend invited us i did not want to mention this at the ti "
"we were in 20 people, ordered different dishes, starters and desserts. i ordered risotto with forests mushrooms and.. it was really bad risotto with champignons.. and frozen asparagus. bad taste, too salty. forests mushrooms only from bullion cube. not worth that price. my boyfriend ordered duck, which was also not so tasty. too chewy and without duck tas "
"my husband and i visited in the opening month. we were quite disappointed and would much rather have a very tasty burger for half the price at finnegans pub in the center. food was edible though, but we wont be visiting aga "
the restaurant looks very nice (i was staying in the hotel) and the staff is dressed very smart. had the signature dish the short ribs. presented very nice but for my taste there was to much fat and to little real meat. the freshnstrawberry and ice cream dessert was good! prices are reasonable.
"i have no idea what happened, but what used to be a really nice restaurant has really gone downhill."
"the present owner, in charge for about five years, know how to attract guests including the ones who are going to orpheus afterwar "
"we visited this restaurant many times between 2003 and 2006 under the name of la palette and were supporters, when fire stopped their operation. restarted as la niche in 20.. and the first time we had a bad experience, cold atmosphere and not creative food. learned recently that new management had taken over since 2 years and positive news, so try aga "
"it was a first time for us that we were going to a van der valk restaurant; it is a very big restaurant, service is friendly and quick...the food is less that average (i ate better in some dutch snack-bars..), but what shocked us was the moment when the waiter brought our bottle of bordeaux to our table already opened...apparently the restaurant manager had ordered to have the bottles of wine already opened this because not all young serving staff did get a proper horeca training. that was a first even in the netherlands (after 33 years leaving here.. :-) ) "
note: we ate here as part of our arraignment with the hotel de cathar 
"this restaurant offers a live cooking buffet. i decided to try and this prooved to be a bad decision. the buffet has limited options and my impression was that the food had been prepared hours ago, so when i got to eat it it was not really good any mor "
the downside of the hotel is the restaurants limited choice of vegan/plant-based food. not even a milk alternative next to coffee machines or dairy-free creamer in the room (how about some alpro coconut/almond/oat or soya?) i would love a cappucci 
"we arrived at the restaurant and had no reservation. it tok about five minutes before someone from the staff noticed us. we asked foir a table for two and that was no problem, even we had no reservation. it took a while (again) before they gave us the menu. we orderd something to drink and that took nearly ten minutes before we get something. after that everything seems to go smoother, but the gap between the apatizer and the main menu was hughe. thats why we doubt to order a dessert. we desided to order it and now there was a normal gap between the main menu and the dessert. we desided not to go there again and for sure not with guests"
"first of all i want to under-mark, that since many years we regularly visit restaurant de cantharel - both for buffet as for live cooking and ala carte me "
"nice atmosphere, friendly staff. didnt listen very well to our order. we asked the childrens steak to be prepared well done but received it very raw. side dish to my salad never arrived. not much attention from staff once our food was served. food itself was oke, not spectacular but reasonable quality for the price we paid."
"whether it is because of the low ceilings, but dinner in this restaurant was not really a pleasant affair.  the food is good but the atmosphere in and the ambiance of the restaurant did not do it for us on this occasion."
"purely for food and dining experience, i would rate this place 3 points, average. but because of all the dogs they allow inside, i cannot rate this place more than 2 points. i will not retu "
"i had lunch here with a former co-worker. when we arrived and found a table, we ordered our drinks and asked for the menu. after getting the drinks, we still had no menu, so after another 5 minutes we tackled another waitress to ask again for a menu. when we ordered our food the appliance the waitress used already had problems. food came quickly and was fine. as the waitress removed our plates we immediately asked for the bill as my friend needed to get back to the office and had only 15 minutes left untill her meeting. we waited for at least 10 minutes and still had no bill, so we decided to get up and find a check-out option. the waitress asked if we had already gotten a receipt: no we didnt, we asked for one 10 mins ago and nothing... she would check it out. she came back and said that our order could not be found in the computer, so another employee came, wrote down our order and had to input it in the computer again. by that time my friend was already too late for her meeting. after about 15 mins we finally got our bill and could pay. what irritated me most what that we got no apology whatsoever. no discount, no coupon for next time.. nothing."
had a good lunch with a business relation. nice waiter who almost works there for 25 years. we ate some eggs and had some coffee. everything fine. tables are close to each other in certain areas of the restaurant so would not go there for a romantic dinner.
"together with some friends we tried this place, well thats once. food came out frozen out of the microwave, and were glad that we didnt got sick."
"this was our first repeat visit since discovering la cubanita a few years ago. unfortunately, nothing has changed for the bett "
"we were there in february for a business / relach dinner ... nice place, cosy place, fresh food, nice drinks ... but can only be considered as exceptionnal, fabulous, fantastic,  "
"i went here for dinner with work. we were seated at a nice secluded table, which was good. problem was that the staff could not reach half of us so everyone had to reach for their drinks and food while it was being handed across the table. it looked like our waitress was still pretty new to the job as she was at times quite clumsy, she could not remember any orders and had to be asked several times for refills on drin "
"being the most busy terrace at the square, we choose for jules verne. a friendly guy guided us to our table, which he cleaned with a wiping cloth. during our dinner we learned that this wiping cloth doesnt get cleaned! he used it at every table time after time "
"we have waited 10 minutes before someone asked what do we want to drink and bitterballen also were not delicious, very fried."
the girl sitting outside was sweet and friendly: normal service. but the coffee she brought out....disgusting it tasted as if the milk used was expired or sat outside for too long. waste of 3 euros & will definitely not be picking up any coffees from here again. i recommend spending a euro more and going around the corner to doppio.
"had a good meal outside on the terrace service was slow , not enough staff , it is the same everywhere you go now"
"nothing is bad here, but nothing is great either. its quite ok, a little standard. but hey, this is apeldoorn, so you cant really expect anything great. just go and enjoy your stay."
we enjoyed a very nice salad and a good glace of wine at jules verne in apeldoorn. it is located in the middle of the city center so it is a very nice place to relax in between shopping or at the end of the da 
"the food is excellent, but.. what a pity that the restaurant is on a top day fully booked.. and the tables are cramped.. the people you see are people who you find normally in snackbars.. and are not really appreciating good food...the price of the wines is 3times what you pay in the stores.. and that is what i find a rip of.. but there is plenty of staff and they really do their best.. so what is wrong with us?? we think the chef deserves a better clientele... and guest who are willing to pay more and have some more space.."
"was not good,we eated in this restaurant but atmosphere and food was totaly not real italian.we are use to eat and be served much better in italy"
"the food was pretty decent, however a request to receive a table at the window wasnt honored, even though many tables were available. they told us these tables were reserved for groups of 6 or larger and we were a party of 4. not even 5 minutes later one was given to a party of 3. on request we received tap water with our wine, however when we asked for a second carafe of tap water they told us they would have to charge us for it."
went here with a group of friends (approximately 15). our orders were given to the wrong people and it resulted in a lot of confusi 
"many times i was told that yume is the best japanese restaurant in apeldoorn. so i was looking forward to eating there. unfortunately it was disappointing. the food was at best average. the taste, the quality and the freshness. all in all not very japanese. there are much better choices in apeldoorn for this kind of food."
arriving at 18.00 with a group of

"after reading the reviews we visited this restaurant in apeldoon, was very disappointing experience, the owner who runs this restaurant has the word guest hospitality not in his vocabilary very rude. the service from the waiters was ok & the food reasonable but surely not worth the price they charge. i had crème brûlée for desert, that desert i really dont know how they dare to offer that. it doent come any where 1% close to what crème brûlée  "
"came with a group, our company fills at least two tables here each evening. put us on a table that was way too small. did not want to solve this, needed some heavy persuasion to get an extra chair that was given with a manner than can only be described as contempt. foodwise, i had the seasonal menu, first course was average and common, main course was a good piece of meat but with far more salt than needed for this quality, dessert again was not special. "
"the quality of the food is good: i had the deep fried mushrooms with herb-cream sauce as a starter and it was a good as i remembered. main dish grilled salmon with risotto. nice piece of salmon, grilled to perfection: very moist and tender. the portions are not huge and i think the prices are a bit high. for 2 people having both just 2 courses (of which for 1 person it was even a summer special menu for 24 euro), some bread to start and a total of 3 glasses of wine and 1 coffee, i think 75 euro is a bit over the top. therefore, the rating average."
we visit this restaurant on a sunday in december.  the restaurant was very nice decorated in x-mas style.. is was fully booked.  good  food and  great service.  the time betweem the different courses of the menu was too long.as a result of the many guests.
this is a restaurant since 1993 in an old buildi 
"the offered food is indeed very good, not cheap. the offered menu;s are too small and far to expensive for those little portions. staff is friendly and the service is ok."
we were there with seven friends and had a fine dinner and a good time! the place is small but nice. normal prices.
"waited 45 minutes for appetisers to arrive. after 1 hour and 40 minutes our main courses had still not arrived so we paid our bill and left. the place was busy but this was really unacceptable - it appeared that the kitchen could not keep up with the number of diners, who are packed into the restaurant with very little space. the appetisers we had reflected the menu, rather old-fashioned heavy french food, and the bread served at table was stodgy white supermarket style baguette. disappointing!"
was there for the first time and invited by a friend. the regular cook seems to be ill for a long time and the kitchen is managed by juniors it seems not knowing how to fry ossenhaaspuntjes. the aspergus soup was fine and the cheese as desert ni 
price-quality fair. due to misunderstanding (....) we have waited more than an hour for starters. nice ambiance. recommended.
i ate here. it looked cute and it was very busy. 
i had a business dinner in this restaurant. outside was terribly cold with snowy. but i liked athmosfer in this place with kind waiters..
"we called in for a dinner before we crossed the road to the theater. the food is allright, but when in a hurry the quality of the food might differ from time to time. the service is good and fast!"
"the staff kicked my husband only because he is from russia, and said it to him!!! we were very surprised, it was the fist time to hear this!!!"
will not come again. 
"nice place, cosy atmosphere, friendly service. food too much adapted to dutch taste, at least that is how we experienced it when ordening szechuan."
"after a recommendation from our hotel we visited this place and were assured it would be good food. i ordered strips of chicken but unfortunately the chicken tasted very greasy and poor quality so my plate was left full at the end of the meal. i would have given this place a 1 off my own experience but my friend managed to eat his, despite finding it lacking in flavour (chicken curry). cant say i can recommend this place and i was v surprised to see this place so highly rated on here!"
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
"the food at parthenon was far too salty, not big on seasonings, and over-priced for what you got. the atmosphere is nice and the staff competent, but the food left a lot to be desired. if you want good greek food in the netherlands, make the effort to go to akropolis restaurant in alphen aan den rijn."
"as lovers and consumers of greek food on a regular basis, i could say that although the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was good and friendly, the food was mediocre. no real greek taste to anything, nothing traditional, just very plain tasting dishes. also quite pricey for a greek restaurant! the tzatziki had no bite to it, there was no pita or oven bread available, desert was dull and tasteless and the meat and sea food had nothing greek about them. disappointed - will not return!"
"after a business meeting i went to this restaurant france atmosphere. the weather was good so choose to sit outside. food, they only serve 3 course menus started with escargo, it was salty like the north sea! too oily garlic butt "
"food was ok. the service was fast but the staff mentioned some new rules, so the beverages cannot be shared and there cant be water bottles on the table if they werent purchased there. they said that there are cameras and a lady checking if we are following those rules.. that was a little bit weird to hear. we were lucky to arrive before the rush hour: there was a queue for entering and a queue for paying. "
"this retsaurant has good pricing. regular dish at about 10 euro. food is asian style and quality is fine, not good or perfect. anlot of young people here. gluten free options are availabke here. if you search for a good and cheap dinner this is a good place to go to. not cosy but still okay. "
"yesterday night we went to dadawan with two friends visiting from germany. i praised the place highly to them. so they went with high expectations. but it started quite badly as they served bed wine to one of us. the wine smelled and tasted bad and acidic as if it went sour. he told a waiter who was merely a kid of 17 or 18 i think, very kindly to place the wine. and also the kimchi which was so salty that it was not even easy to eat. the kid started giving us stares through the whole time. and even though we returned one glass of one and two bowls of kimchi, they counted everything in the bill and we paid it without saying anything because it became already too bitter experienc "
"walked into arnhem at around 9:00 pm and was greeted by several restaurants that they stop serving at 9:00 pm. ok it was a monday in late october, but fair play to the dadawan, they were willing to serve us but made it clear when they would need the last orders by. so we ate. the burger was huge - a clear korean speciality and the hot stone dishes were very hot indeed. and loved the brand beer."
"portions are huge, hence beware of the number of dished you order. we had a chicken curry rice (mediocre) and noodle soup with chicken and vegetables followed by a fresh fruit platter. i would not recommend the chicken curry rice. the rest was ok."
"although the food is of good quality, the portions are very small, taking the high price into account.  furthermore, its clear that because of cutting costs, hardly any side dishes are being served. conclusion, good food, but very expensive.l and small portions."
the food is mediocre but expensive. the waitress was very rude to us and the other waite 
"perhaps we came at the wrong time; late for lunch and a tad too early for dinner! the place was crowded, but we were offered a table for two. the breakfast/lunch menu was on offer, but apart from salads, there was limited gluten free choice. i ended up with the dutch pea soup, which was very good, except for the fact that on a separate place they still offered me bread! half way through eating our meal, the menus were changed for the evening, so although i did not look at this menu, perhaps we should just have had a drink first and then waited before ordering a meal! nice place to sit and watch the world go by!"
"i was looking forward to trying out the food in this place for quite some time. i went with a group of friends just before the dinner service started with the idea to have a drink first and order food a bit later. we wanted to sit outside, but the available tables had no chairs (people from neighboring tables took them away), so we sat inside. no one came to show us to seats or to greet us (the staff was going around us, as if we were in their way). we sat on the table and waited for about 20 minutes before someone came to take an order. we had our drinks and waited for someone to come to collect food order, but no one did. we paid and lef "
we had just the worst food ever! big lia 
"great location, close to the station. nice in- and outdoor seating with friendly staff. we both had the ribs tasting platter, so 4 flavors. the meat was well cooked but out of the 4 i had, i really only liked one (classic). the others werent very special in taste but my friend had different ones and liked them. on monday, wednesday and thursday they do a -ribs, fries and salad-deal for €12,50. oh and on a good summer day, go for ice cream next door :)!"
"very nice atmosphere, great service. however, portion sizes are way too small. the dishes are definitely interesting but nothing crazy. by the 5th course i’m still not full. going to have to stop by mcdonalds on the way home to eat something substantial."
"this meal was a joke. we paid eur 90 per person for a 5 course meal (i use this term loosely) with wine pairing. normally i would not find this amout unreasonable, however if you totalled the weight of the 5 courses we were served, it came out to perhaps 150grams of food per person. i realize that nouvelle cuisine is often served in small portions but this was an insult. unfortuanley the wine portions were equally small. this was a tasting, not a meal! luckily they served free bread. the tastings were interesting and if you feel compelled to go to this restaurant, make sure you eat before you go."
"ordered take-out, beef with rice dish. tasted great but felt like overpaying for the amount of beef. ratio was like 80-20 on the rice."
nothing special. the food was ok and so were the drinks. it looks cooler in the pictures than in reality. the prices are relatively high and the portions quite small.
"the balance between price and food quality has dropped to an all time low. not only food preparation (burned, over cooked) as well as ingredients (stove meat is not supposed to be used for sate)."
the atmosphere is nice and the staff was super friendly. they explained about the menu and how the tablet for ordering food and drinks wo 
"had a few drinks, 3/4 we needed to ask when they would arrive, small food platter did not make it to the table"
there is no warm welcome here. they treat you as if you are doing them a favour. i work in the town with a group of colleagues and we tried to eat here four times and have succeeded only once because they chose to close the kitchen whenever they want and it’s not at all consistent with their published opening times. even when we did manage to sit they were far from pleasant.
having had excellent food here a number of times we got to see a very different side of rung this ti 
friendly service. good choice and good indication on spicyness of the meals. tasty but averidge.  would go there again
"i went to this restaurant alone after a long day of helping move my sons stuff while he was on introduction week. when i said table for one the reception was rather cold and i did not feel welcome. however during the meal the staff was actually nice and at the end even the owner tried to be friendly. the restaurant is very pretty, cosy and well decorated. the food and the service were a bit of a disappointment. i ordered fish cakes and chicken curry. the fish cakes were on the table in 2 minutes. they were tasty but missed the delicacy of great thai food. there were presented in big chunks and with far too much oil. then i waited 30 min for the curry! the portion was very generous (actually what i ordered was enough for 2 people) but again the balance of flavours was off. very meaty lacking the beautiful contrasts of tangy and cocconut creamy that make this dish memorable. it could be a jewel: the atmosphere is very nice, the portions generous and the ingredients fresh. but the quality of the cooking and the disorganized service let it down."
i have visited rung many times over the last 6 years whilst traveling to arnhem. in general have always found the food to be of good quality and reasonably priced. i have arranged two large parties for dinner here and again not been disappointed by the food or the servi 
"of all the 4 indonesian restaurants in town, lestari definitely is the most cosy and classy of the bunch with great location near the river banks where you can have a relaxing walk after your meals. however, it is also the most expensive, let down by poor service and bland taste in their food. this restaurant has potential to be the best in town as it has an impressive menu and food presentation which are only let down by their waitresses and cooks."
the interior of the restaurant is just outdated and it looks ready for renovation. i was disappointed by the quality of the food and the lack of passion that apparently went into it.we had a caprese which was unexciting and a tournedos which vos reasonable but not superb that the winds were fine and the waiter took time to explain the origin 
"not amazed, was a normal pizza and pasta, not special. don’t understand why this is nr1 on tripadvisor. pizza was good but really standard, pasta with truffle was no fresh truff "
"not worth the money, 14 euro for a tiny portion of mediocre lasagna is not worth it.  the ragu (bolognese) isnt seasoned properly. and lacks flavor.   i am really disappointed. i expected a lot more."
"an italian restaurant with a good atmosphere in arnhem centre, immediately near the shopping area. we enjoyed good pasta and nice fish, nothing wrong with that. but i found the prices rather exaggerated (my main course was 24,50 for a good piece of fish, two half potatoes, one small tomato etc. not quite enough for this sort of price. tasty bread was charged extra, a 75cl bottle of sparkling water at 5,75. i mean, come on.) staff were very friendly and helpful, though."
"we came back after 10 years. the food is still the reason to come here. dont mind the 70ties interior. the service is not italian, the people didnt find the right approach and our waiter was topping up our glasses too often, which felt unpleasant. we missed the italian hospitality."
"we had dinner here in april. my daughter had a vegetarian option, i had a rib-eye steak. the food was good but overpriced and service was leisurely."
"was ok, staff is very friendly but the portions were huge and the food was quite salty and all tasted the same. we had a family style dinner and it tasted unremarkable."
"we were with a group of 8 and they suggested a shared platter. the amount of food they brought was ridiculous, it was way to much! food was ok but bland. we were full after the first course and the second course was even more. in the end the bill came to over 500 euro for 8 people. way to much. "
in this restaurant you can have a good greek meal. lunch or dinner. it is a cosy restaurant for families and coupes.
"i have been there on the first night of my stay in arnhem. functional position, just few steps away from the station.  souvlaki just tasted normal. the place is a bit too tawdry for my taste.  average prices."
"visited with grandparents and teens. we all could chose and ate with pleasure. greek is about cheese, thats what i remember most. and there s a limit for me. but that is my taste."
"took ages to get menus and food. no wine list-beware they have a choice of 2 red ,2 white or ro "
"the ambience in very nice. the wines delicious, but the food and the service very poor. the service is very slow, i guess because they dont have enough waitresses. the food is standard, nothing special."
we went here on the recommendation of our conscierge. the food was tasty butte portions mean for the money.  the service was slacker than id have expected given the feel the restaurant had. i hate to have to continually ask for refills and water.
"ive been to stir-fry buffet restaurants before, and this is a typical exampl "
"this is a dutch-chinese eating hall. the food is good, not the most culinary or the best you will ever have. but go there with friends and pig-out on lamb-chops or on steak from the grill. but know where you are going, this is a food factory. there is little atmosfere and it is not traditional, but a good place to earn the meat-sweats. the service in the drinks department is a bit lacking but a fun place to visit."
such a terrible restaurant ever. the service is 4/10. food: 3/10: choice limited => i would never eat there again
"we went with 4 friends to eat some tapas at la puerta. it take a considerable time before you get something to eat or drink. once they served the dishes, most of these dishes seemed like these were not freshly prepared or the dishes were cold. the only that makes this restaurant interesting is the location, the basements of arnhem."
the food is good here and a nice price. but i would prefer la cubanita (not so far away from this restaurant) to eat tapas.
"great for sharing food. most of it was nice, but used to be better. i was really looking forward to the spareribs, unfortunately they were a bit dry. but other than that, it was a great night out."
"slightly off the tourist track, this is a cosy restaurant worth trying if you fancy an italian. service was a little slow at times (hence the 3/5 score), but it was a very relaxed experience and the food was cooked well. i had the rigatoni all’arrabiata - delicious. very good value."
"the food at zafvino has always been great - along with the wines and wonderful antipasti, nothing to complain about. i think zafvino should consider to limit the amount of guests on the terrace if they want to keep the quality of their service hi "
"we made a reservation for indoors but turned up early for a drink beforehand. although there seemed to be many available tables outdoors under shelter where we would have been happy to sit in the meantime, we were offered a seat at a table apart, halfway in the rain. declining this, we left and returned for our meal; however, it didn’t seem they were expecting us, despite our arrival 45 minutes earlier. they offered us a place on bar-stools, while again, there were tables indoors available. when we asked to move, we were given a table near the entrance, where people were stood waiting to be seated. in these times of social distancing, this did not seem appropriate. we opted to leav "
"bustling restaurant, busy, nice atmosphere. we were allocated a spot where you practically needed a torch to see your food - extremely dark. moved - “that’s better...” wine was good! but waitress forgot half our food order. food took ages to arrive. difficult to get attention of waitresses. very frustrating. cos otherwise the place isn’t bad "
zafvino is one of my favourite places in arnhem however tonight i was quite disappointed by the services. it was full of young service (nothing wrong with that) only they were not attentive and there seemed to be no senior staff around. it’s not a bargain place so service should be to par it would be a shame that such an amazing wine and food place losses clients because of an easily solved problem. you can do better zafvino 
poor food poor service. the location is ok but the food is less than on would expect. service is poor asked for some extra bread never arrived.  perhaps for the best . not a place to sit and relax.
"arrogant service and presumptuous attitude. asked to see the wine list to be told there was not one and that the waiters were the wine list. upon asking, limited or no knowledge of italian wines. they claim to be an italian restaurant. food was average to good and the ambience was nice. its just a pity that the service dampens the overall quality of the evening. will not go there again."
"probably i was really unlucky, but my experience with this place was very ba "
"the ambiance and wait staff at the restaurant is great. the food is pretentious, tasteless and oversalted. i have come here a number of times while visiting my parents. the last visit on september 1 st for example they served buggles filled with carrot pate. while creative it was not tasty. i think it is pretentious. then the tenderloin i was served was oversalted. this was the same with my wives fish dish and my daughters fish dish. this is repeatedly like this. my suggestion would be that wait staff try what is served from time to time to guide the chef. apart from this issue it ends up being a nice dining experience."
the food - excelle 
"trix has a modern fresh interior and the atmosphere is generally good. for the children there is a play corner with games for young children and multiple video games ages 7 and up, the waiters are young, doing their best but inexperienced, and they seem to have too many tables to serve at the same time. the kitchen staff definitely needs better coordination as the different plates were not served at the same time to all guests at the table; there seriously was 5 mins between the first and last plate being served causing the food cooling down (as we always wait until everybody has its plate). this is not the first time it happened to us at this restaurant, and this time it even happened with both our entrees as well as our main dishes. the food is overall alright and price / quality ratio is good."
"if you do not like the combination of rare french fries with mayonaisee, do not go to this restaurant. again, we have the reunie and we spent tea time, lunch and dinner at tr "
"we were five: two adults, one child and two babies. the service at the beginning was pretty good, the waiter explained everything but the main course came after 30 minutes. the waiting was too much since we ordered steak, fish, two chicken nuggets and the restaurant was empty. only  "
"in this small street there is this restaurant with two separate locations. we were in the garden, so nice! the staff is friendly and attentive."
"i normally love this place, great atmosphere and food. yesterday we went there with friends. the food was good but the service and staff where terrible! from the start we got the feeling of not being welcome. cold staff, candles where not replaced and they started cleaning around 2230 hrs (vacuum cleaner put in sight etc). i hope it was a one off... "
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
"the ambiance is good, they have a terrace with a nice view over the rive "
the service was so poor we ended up leaving early. the last 2 orders were not put through which was 8 dishes. at 9.45pm we were told they were just getting to it but it was too late. a shame as my husband left hungry!
we had to wait for more than 1 hour until our first order arrived. the placed orders after that were not much better. we didn’t receive all we are ordered and also some incorrect dishes. we had to go to the bar to ask for silverware and they had to find from dirty plates and clean it. it seems the have serious staffing problems. we used to go there frequently but will stay away for some time until they have sorted out their problems.
"visited here in april for a sushi meal. basically pay for what you order and if you order too much and cannot eat it, you still pay. varying price options according to which menu you choose from. the food was good, but have had better sushi. service friend, polite and helpful. limited drinks choice. limited gluten free options."
"basic sushi quality. a bit better than other allyoucaneat places, but thats about it. the staff was friendly - although they forced us to buy drinks under the pretext that it was mandatory. after searching in their house rules, we didnt find any rule regarding this. its a large place with a commercial ambience. "
"this is your famous all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, but then just a bit better for the same price. they now even have a all-you-can-drink menu €10,-, im a fan! the menu for the sushi or grill is also a bit better i find then at other sushi places."
"the place is nice and cosy. you can have good all you can eat sushi. friendly staff, definitely i good place if you want to experience sushi!"
"good variation on the menu, friendly staff, quick service - good value for money. i especially enjoyed the desert menu, they had some good options in small portions so you could try out a lot."
"its about quantity, not about quality, even though it is a large restaurant with little atmosphere, the crew is very friendly and wellwilling. avrrage sushi for a very reasonable price."
"i would like to be able to give sushi koi a better review. most of the sushi i ordered as part of the all you can eat lunch was tasty, some were really good and i reordered these twice or even 3 times. in particular maki sushi rolls or wraps featuring roe from flying fish or salmon were delectable, as was the white fish nigiri, i think it was dorado or sea bass... the futomaki was different from the norm that is vegetarian with maybe sweet egg omelette; in addition to veggie strips it had salmon and a layer of roe as its outer garnish, and it was huge. two hand rolls i ordered were meh, so i didnt try more than two given the fine other optio "
"just awfull.... fast food .. bad service, wine no thanks: dont need a headache and the bill is just a happy moment because you can leave.."
"we visited this place 17 february 2015, and it was ok. very big restaurant, looks well managed. not the best sushi weve had though. we were surprised that sashimi was included in the price, but sadly it was very thick sliced and there were a lot of fishbones in it (4 fishbones in 3 portions is a lot, i think). the rest of the sushi was ok, but there was not a lot of choice i think. the dragon roll was the best for me. however, i really didnt like some of the combinations, like salmon maki with garlic/herb cream cheese, or the wakame salad with corn and pine nuts (this was disgusting). i did like that the dessert was included as well, especially the deep-fried sweet bun was very good. unfortunately the coconut pudding was split and tasted like other things from the fridge (yuck "
"the first thing you are told when you enter this place is the all you can eat concept... and that you will be fined if you dont finish a dish. they say to stop people ordering more than they can eat but you end up feeling more like a naughty child than a valued customer. some of the food was very good. particularly the sashimi and the miso soup. some not so good, like the sushi with tinned fish. service and friendliness lacking. we also got charged for side dishes as we left, though it wasnt clear at the beginning that these items were not included in the all you can eat price. a so so experience i thought."
"we liked this place more when it was chinese muur but since they re-styled and re-branded to renao we decided we will not return. its a pitty, real "
"the restaurant is comfortably situated near the openlucht museum. parking available, an attractive terrace and lots of green around. the staff is very friendly, the food served is ok, they offer some pleasant dishes you dont find in the average chinese restaurant. the taste is adapted to the european guests, a reminder of asia. a good place to invite people, a place to come back to."
"probably the worst meal i have had in arnhem. i order the prawns to start, and received a very small shrimp in sauce dish for 9.95 euro. at bill time i was asked how the meal was, i explained the starters was disappointing, the response was its shrimps, you should have looked at the menu better. the menu states in de oven gebakken garnalen met een groente roomsaus which to me translates to prawns. and at 9.95 euros prawns is what are to be expected. never to return. "
"came here with my husband and dad, but this time the standard dropped. the food is dull and all we liked was the bread with sauce. disappointed with the results. will think twice to come back. this was our favourite turkish restaurant as i have been there for many years. "
"we went there on a saturday night, not too busy and a very good service. the restaurant looks beautiful with its classic atmosphere, the food on the other hand is good but not amazing, i didnt enjoy too much the pasta crepes (if i had read the menu with more attention i wouldnt have taken the risk) while the picassos chicken had a perfect sauce with an amazing flavor, but the chicken itself was not cooked good enough. my girlfriends dishes were looking better to be hones "
have used this bistro many times in the past when coming to arnhem for the para reunion...but tonight the food was awful...the service was really bad..i have always recommended this place to others...but not no more and i will not be returning in the future.
"if you want something that tastes worse than the cafeteria around the corner and pay about the same.. go here. dry (to long baked) meat, burned and/or overcooked sides.. for simple dishes i can cook at home i expected more. got a glass of wine thrown over me and an apology would not have been misplaced. ive been here a second time to not misjudge the first visit, what a waste of time and money... there are far better restaurants in arnhem that are actually worth visiting, skip this one if you want a descent night out!"
"on monday the 3rd of august my wife and i decided to have dinner at momento. it looked nice and it wasnt very busy, so we expected a quick service. how wrong were we! okay, they were quick with the drinks, but after ordering the food it all went down hill. we ordered a pea soup and beefburger for me and a vegan burger for my wi "
do not trust open hours information. came at 21:00 and they decide to close the kitchen sooner. neither the attendant could explain why. not trustworthy
"we called in to momento for a snack. the restaurant is large, new and very modern. the food was ok and the prices were very reasonable. however, there is no character or atmosphere in the restaurant – it reminded me of eating in a motorway service station café!"
"decent place, ideal when you decide last minute to have dinner with a larger group of friends. large restaurant, but always animate "
we found this place open for dinner within 5 blocks of the city center on a busy evening and it turned out to be more of a tapas style restaurant where you can order a few items to share except it had a limited menu with very entre ite 
"having ordered oyster rockafella to start then pork and salad, i waited 1 hour to have the salad arriv "
"we went for lunch but a lot of things in the menu you need to pay more to orde. for example de edamame beans. there is only one dessert included in the menu: fried banana, all the others you need to pay extra. i will not go again!"
"horrible service and unfriendly staff. food was okayish, but there are better sushi/japanese restaurants in arnhem!"
was looking for a way to order and a specific meal. women on the phone was very rude. started sighs after i askes a question. based on this way of contact i wont want to order or eat there again.
"i’ve been to different restaurants of sumo but this one was not so good we ordered drinks and it took them ages, some sushi didn’t taste very well and the noodles were uncooked!"
"this is your typical sushi all you can eat dinner or lunch. the service is semi okay, but not personal. the taste of the food is okay, but not specia "
came to sumo for good sushi. wasnt exactly up to my expectations. its an all you can eat restaurant. so do not come here if youve eaten before and make sure to have at least 50 euros in your pocket. sushi is okay. not exactly the best quality but pretty decent. service is really fast even with a full house. also staff was fast to clean the tables which is good.
"the presentation is nice. the service was quick, but other than a few rolls, like the spicy tuna, the salmon with wasabi mayo, the dishes were mediocre and sometimes seem to be smoothered in bottled sauces. the tuna and salmon tartar were generous portions but the fish was tasteless. two other unpleasant surprises: 1. no sashimi dishes are included, for any sashimi dish one has to pay extra somewhere between 3 and 12.5 euros per dish. 2. there is no selection of dutch beers, only expensive japanese beer or bavar "
although the food is decent and the prices are reasonable i dont like the fact that i am allowed to stay at the restaurant for up to (not even) 2hours and be in a rush. this is not enjoyable.
"the all you can eat formula and the food tastes ok, it is usually very busy do booking a good idea, there is also another restaurant around the corner with same firmula which us better"
"we have been waiting for 30 minutes and nobody came to help us, so i went inside and a blond girl said they were full while they were not( a lot of free tables) . all the people there were waiting for a waiter to come , and few tables needed to be cleaned up. horrrible service, it’s not worth it. they don’t want to wor "
"food was extremely salty, and a certain staff member was very rude. we bought two bottles of water, and two soft drinks, but then didn’t want to buy another bottle so drank from the water bottle we already had on us, but the waitress came over to tell us off. i’ve never experienced this before where tap water wasn’t available for free, and then to be told off for not buying another overpriced bottle of tap water. maybe if the food was less salty we wouldn’t have needed to. also maybe speaking with guests in a respectable tone would have been better than shouting rudely at "
"been here with housemates and it was something i would regret  awful service, they wont stop confusing tables. food is mediocre, it gives you the feeling you can do it yourselves but better) for €25,- go somewhere else like pinocchio or beren (bears)."
"hadnt been here for a while, they changed the seating a bit. its quite cozy, dimmed lights. its fun that you can write on the walls but its been done so much that it looks messy now. the first couple of tapas were nice, very tasty. i didnt like that some of the portions were really small, others were quite big for one person to eat. and towards the end the tapas we ordered didnt taste very nice and were a bit dry. not sure that it was because it was towards the end or because thats just how they are. also, my friend wanted a glass of wine and they gave him two choices, only to later discover there was also a cheaper house wine we didnt know about so well done on their side, but not very friendly towards the customers. all in all for the price you pay, its alright. no time limit and unlimited tapas. theres quick service and its okay if you dont finish the tapas, they dont charge extra for it. perfect idea for groups to share food."
we went there at 4.30 pm and they told us it opens at 5 so we waited till 5 and went it again however then they told us we had to make a reservation or wait another hour to get a table. even though there were lots of tables free. would not recommend because of the bad service we got without even eating there. 
tapas were hard to order and understand the menu. we ended up eating several things we did not order. and the place is noisy and hot as hell. and walls with hand writing on them. should have been a clue as to the grade of the food and service. one friend had a panic attack from the noise and crowd..
"went here on a monday evening. the location is good, in the centre of the city. inside its cramped with small tables and narrow spaces between them. the walls are filled with texts from previous guests, i really disliked this and i cant imagine anyone being enthusiastic about these decorations. the service in the restaurant was a bit random, the waiting staff just seemed to walk around without any plan. we didnt have to wait particularly long for drinks/food but no one seemed to be bothered to clean the tables around us which emphasized the trashed feeling in this restaurant (e.g. ~45 minutes to clean up a table after 1 couple had paid!? "
"my wife and i ate here after being recommended, i would listen to that person aga "
"open for lunch too now, which is a good idea. if it comes to food: excellent. great salads and fabulous kroketten. kid friendly, staf is fine. but what it lacks is atmosphere. the finishing touch is not there or not there yet. probably a better place to sit outside in summer than to sit inside. i suspect very good for lunch or dinner with kids as they have a seperate playroom for them, viewing the reataurant through a glass door."
"we chose from the special 3-course-menu. choice is not exciting. however, the food is good. next time ill choose from the menu."
"we came here as a family of four for high tea on mothers day. after being seated, we waited for a full 30 minutes before getting served a small bowl of soup each. another 45 mins later and after asking the server twice when we were getting the next dishes, we finally got our food. the server practically threw the plates on the table and disappeared without explaining what the items were. i overheard another waitress for the table next to us telling the guests what each of the food items were so it was disappointing we werent extended the same courtesy. also our high tea wasnt served on tiered platters as i expected, which detracted from the whole experience. (i asked when we paid why we didnt get our food on the tiered serving platter and the waitress said they ran out of them). we werent asked once during eating if everything was ok, if the food was nice etc. i understand it was busy but this was unacceptable. the service was subpar to say the least. such a pity as the surroundings in the park are beautiful and the food was reasonable. the white asparagus soup was very tasty. we wont be returning."
"the slow stew roasted pork was dry, the tuna was like defrosted tuna from a supermarket and the duck was also dry and i’m not a professional cook but i can cook same food better. i think this restaurant is very overpriced. "
"recently weve had diner with 12 people in one of the separate rooms. the menu was oke, nothing special. it felt like a 13 in a dozen one. at the same time there was a wedding party which they need to serve. we had to do our own drinks, organizing the table setting etc "
"made a reservation for lunch. there happend to be some miscommunication and instead of properly handle it, the staff was rude and not helpful."
busy place on this nice april sunday afterno 
"not a bad place especially when the sun is out on the terrace. it looks ambitious but is a little would be, service very wellwilling but not very experienced and no eye for the table. getting attention for wine and water was really anneffort. food is good but not surprising. price on the high end."
"this lovely spot is no longer accessible for us, as the staff will only give people access if they dine. and if you are in a wheel chair: shame on you, but sorry, can not accomodate you -even on the terrace-! heard this three times on different occasions. a disgrace to arnhem!"
"de boerderij is a very nice location next to the park sonsbeek, in a fabulous surrounding. the restaurant personally visited and known for over 30 years, has changed several times from ownership, management, whatsoever. the quality hasnt been always as superb as it has been in the early days, but this place for its entourage is really worth your visit. nowadays when lucky you can enjoy an excellent dinner ."
"the boerderij is located on the edge of sonsbeek park in arnhem, a truly stunning setting with a great terace for outside dinners, dutch weather permitting. i have had dinner here a couple of times over the last year. the interior is a nice mix between authentic farmhouse features in a contempary design. funny though how the comfortable chairs seem to a few inches too low to sit at the table properly. the staff is an interesting mix between the regular management and some youngster who really try hard. management seem to have lost the real desire to give you a superb guest experience. the menu offers traditional choices, in the autumn often a variety of game. allthough the food is well prepared it is a basic or perhaps i should say safe choice of ingredients. well prepared and good quality, but not very exciting. the weakest part of the experience is the wine list, and the lack of advise. it almost feels as if they are not really interested in wines. yes there is a selection with a choice of spanish wines, but i cannot discover a filosophy. the wines chosen from spanish region are mediocre. the one great bordeaux is the sélection madame du château cantenac 2007, also the only half bottle on the wine list. not a great year and ofcourse far to young to drink. serivce is too matter of factly, not bad but not outstanding. overal a nice place that just doesnt reach its potential."
"service was poor, it felt like we were not welcome, but that could also be due the fact that there were only 8 guests in total. the restaurant was a ghost town, and i understand why. the food was the worst, the meat was not even good enough to feed to a dog. you can get better food at the local snackbar. also be aware that no one talks dutch here, so english on "
"let me start off positively. beautiful place, great ambiance. have eaten here 3 times and the quality of the food varies. once everything came together very nicely. all good. but the last time it was a total trainwreck. waited for the food for over 90 minutes, the orders were wrong, service terrible, and the food was below par. the reason/excuse that was given? management (or ownership) had recently changed and things were a bit chaotic. i do not know if that has been cleared up and i wont be back to find out."
"place is nice, food ok but service is a disaster. we went for business lunch with 12 people and we were waiting around 1.5 hours then only 12 meals were delivered and one colleague had to wait another 10 minutes. not recommend for business lunches."
"mothers day lunch with 7 persons, restaurant had 3 other parties besides ours. expectations shot up by the chique welcome and the classic interiors. we were surprised by the special menu which wasnt advertised on their website, however, luckily also the normal menu was also availabl "
weve been here before and were looking forward to a quality dinner. parking is easy and the terrace is well equipped for outdoor dinin 
"villa has a nice convenient location. we came for a romantic dinner and the atmosphere was suitable for a pleasant evening. however, on the terrace there was no designated space for non-smokers and our meal experience was overshadowed by unpleasant and toxic fumes. towards the evening we couldnt see our plates anymore because it got dark and there was no light except one candle per table. the service was exceptionally slow as we got our starters exactly one hour after ordering. after pointing out the delay the staff did not apologize for this inconvenience. we had to ask separately for everything: bread, salt, pepper - as none of that was present at the tabl "
the building is absolutely amazing and the staff is very friendly. the food looked much nicer than it tasted and we expected much more for this high price tag! my meat was tough and hard to chew and some of the other dishes were pretty tasteless. a real disappointment!
"service was quite ok, but food not so good. and still had to pay € 50 each. would not really recommend it."
we went to this place to try the magic sushi set they promote. the sushi was served with good portion of soy sauce and wasabi and we even got two pieces of sushi extra because of a november offer. the sushis tasted fresh and were not too bad (the quality can be compared to other all you can eat sushi joints). the only minus point was that there was mayonaise added to most of the sushi and that really made us feel fuller quickly.
"when you mix perfection with imperfection, the results are imperfect. thats unfortunately my experience with this little plac "
"we understand we dont speak dutch and some dutch dont speak english. the chinese lady that greeted us spoke no english and we ask for the buffet. she understood that and pointed us to one buffet rack with a second one near by but she make no indication toward it. she was able to understand our drink order. we when to the buffet rack indicated and served ourselves. we continued to serve ourselves from that rank until we were full. she made no attempt to advise us of other opportunities for our meal. as i left the buffet rack for the second time she spoke to me and of course i could not understand it. a dutch gentleman explained to me that we only used a very small portion of the dinner that was available to us. upset i returned to the table where my friends had finished and were waiting on me. a chinese man came to collect the very high bill and to our surprise. he spoke perfect english. we would advise that unless you speak dutch to avoid this restaurant. of the reviews i have ever given, this is the worst."
"the food selection is very wierd, difficult choices and no simple stuff like a torsie or broodje kroket. secondly there are no heathy things on the menu. the most healthy choice coms with gefrituurde kip. sometimes owners choose funny choices to stand out but sometimes simplicity rules!! also thh no e restaurant was cold. i wanted to work but went home instead "
nce location to sit and have drinks with friends. the restaurant is situated central of arnhem. is next to the bus stop and 5 minutes walking from the train station.
the staff sometimes cannot see the customers and let them wait so long. the cheese platter is not suitable for non-dutch people. cocktail is okay.
"the glass of my boyfriends favorite beer got smaller. the waiter explained that it didnt, but it did get significantly smaller and the price was the same，but we still spend over 100 euros to show our love，the most crazy thing was that when we walked out of the restaurant, my boyfriend wanted to go back and use the restroom, the waiter at the door said he was not allowed to enter the restaurant because he was not dressed nicely ( he was wearing his errea sweatpants and we just spent over 100 💶 there) we’re so sad and disappointed, bye bye stan "
"the food was top notch, the sevice was terrible, im guessing by other reviews this does not happen oftern, but it happened to me. i will not go to much into the weeds, as this place had great food, but i had little to no service, left for ages to eat, no follow up, food missing, my order was not as requested, waitied ages for bill, gave up and just went to pay my bill. told the young chap about my experinace, apoliges for the bad service, asked do you think he should speak to his manager, silance and nothing, gave up. if this was a training week for staff, i hit it bang on, shocking service, but im guessing a one off."
"not sure why it was crowded. ok the quality if the drinks are not bad, but pricy and services is bit arrogant"
"this place has everything to make it great. location, great food and drinks, nice ambiance. the whole letdown for me is the service. they always seem understaffed and the staff that is there seems to lack the capability of seeing what needs to happen. forgotten drinks, forgotten menus, forgotten empty glasses. such a shame. could be ten out of ten, but is marked down for the service."
very popular bar/restaurant. the main highlight is definitely the huge patio. the coffee was good. the food selection isn’t mouth watering.
"the service was great. the place was super busy. the pretzel app was good. i had the paella and it was...well it was awful. had the place not been so busy i would have sent it back. it was so dry it was actually crispy on the top (rice, mussels, and salad shrimp) and mushy inside. "
"had dinner with friends on a friday evening, seems to be a combination between a cafe/bar and a restaurant...it was very crowdy. friendly staff, good food (had a steak), restaurant itself also looks very nice (the way its designed, decorated)."
"central to all amenities, lovely ambience, love the buzz of the crowd, but alas i found the presentation of food, and the price lacking, even too expensive for what it was.  the service could also be more friendly, we dont owe them anything!"
"it has been the talk of the town, but the quality has certainly not gone up since the beginning. service was with a great smile this time, but the surf & turf burger was nothing special on a not totally fresh bun. its all ok, but you would expect mo "

"a new place in arnhem in an old bank building. great location and design. nice atmosphere. it is very noisy, so i would not go there for an evening out dining with intimate tabletalk! food is ok, very suitable for a quick bite or drinks with friends if you are on your way to the cinema or theatre. the service at the table was very friendly, the lady receiving us and leading to the tables had her off day. "
"the food was very delicious and tasty. as an indian food lover, food was traditional and spicy, as can be expected. the service however was very poor, slow and not service oriented staff. a smile when dealing with customers can go a long way."
"we have recently moved from hilversum to arnhem. so we thought lets try indian food in arnhem. so we went to king of india and ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka and rice. it was a take aw "
"went for dinner as a group. nice reasonably easy service. helpful staff. however food was too spicy. ordered vegetarian dishes mostly and found them having an extra yard of spice. they have only naan bread and not the roti. the naans were not cooked well and were not crisp, found it tough to digest.not coming back again!"

"the variety and choice of food is good, somethings you do not come across usually. i am a vegetarian and still had few choices to make. the portions however are ridiculously small for the price offered. you can go to the restaurant to try it out but otherwise is an expensive bet! there are better options for that money spent. "
"we went for a friday night diner with friends. our expectations were high, knowing the cuisine of ron blaauw. the restaurant was jam packed and therefor quite noisy. we were led to our table by friendly young waiters in a very informal way. because it was a busy night we immediately ordered drinks, still and sparkling water and a bottle of wine. the water came quickly, the wine was forgotten. unfortunately this proved to be an omen. after some time we got to give in our orders, as they are tapas style dishes, we ordered several. it took more then one hour for the first ones to arrive. the tasting experience did not live up to the expectation. actually only the beetroot salad delivered. that cabbage and salmon dishes lack the daring interaction between ingredients. after the first few plates we had to wait another hour. repeated requests to the staff on progress were answered with kitchen isnt coping. this should not happen of course, but even if it does, just inform your guests. with popular restaurants this can happen, and i wonder if the management isnt too much focussed on turn over instead of the quality."
berlin copied the small servings concept from restaurant puur-m in berg en dal. unfortunately they forgot to copy the quality as well. 
"heard some good stuff about this restaurant and liked the concept, so decided to try out. its a trendy restaurant, with nice tables. its large, but does not seem so, due to many pillars and separations. this is at the same time its pitfall. waiters have a hard time to keep track of all the tables. we waited quite some time to be served. when we wanted to order again, we tried for minutes to get attention. the concept is that you choose your courses at euro 10. you can also have some large pieces of meat or fish to share. we had red mullet for three. the fish was served whole, without any vegetables, just fries. some courses were nice. some others, i thought, what were they thinking making this.... if you are planning a group outing, this is okay, if you dont mind the steep price. for planning a romantic tete-a-tete, look elsewhere. the acoustic is so bad, you can hardly hear one another."
"this restaurant serves real nice thai food. all the hits from thailand are on the menu. the value for money is also good. the atmosphere in the dining room however is poor. it is a thai theme, but in such a way that it is uninviting. the staff is young, so young that they are inexperienced and at some point that starts to be a nuisance. i will come back for the food and for nothing else."
"we stopped in for dinner and both came to the conclusion that none of the mains on the menu looked appealing. it wasnt a great start. we ended up ordering some bread, a starter and a dessert. given the warm weather, that was plenty of food, but it wasnt particularly nice fo "
"first time i went here, since new owners took over vurrukkulluk. service is okay. one waitress über-over-the-top-friendly, one clearly inexperienced. but they tried. i had a fusion wonton soup, which was okay, a bit salty. then i had sliptong (small sole fish), which was cooked well. the baked patatoes were old and just crumbled as soon as you touched them. all in all, a step back from the former restaurant. but somethings there to build on. may try again in a year, if theyre still there."
just wasnt good for what you got... staff were very nice but the food was only okay wouldnt bother with a second visit.
there are a lot of great restaurants in nijmegen. this is not one of th 
"visited with a group of work colleagues. place was not busy but service was extremely slow from the start and never speeded up. food was reasonable, but felt slightly overpriced and the portion sizes a bit small."
"i feel extremely sad to provide a low rating to this restaurant. i am a big fan of restaurant ivory and was looking forward to eating at bistro bar ivory, since it opened. sadly, it is not the same standard as the origin "
"the service was very slow. from the beginning to end of our three course meal, we waited a long time. even when our carafe of water was long finished, we waited to be asked if we wanted more water or more wine. i finally stopped the waiter and asked for more water. the wait to order was 15 minutes. the wait for the first course was 45 minutes! then another 30 minutes(at least) for the main course. we were never asked if everything was ok; there simply was no check in with us. it was indeed a very busy night for them, but they should have been prepared for valentines evening as it was fully booked! the starter was good. we had the salmon and carpaccio. the main was luke warm and fair. we had the choc. creme brulee dessert which was far too sweet. the lobs of white choc on top was an addition of sugar that was not necessary and in my opinion no added value to the dessert. a raspberry or strawberry on top would have sufficed. we were recommended by locals to dine here. i am sorry to say, that i will choose differently next time i am in nijmegen."
"a cocktail bar that does not have tequila is shocking! the bar service was bad but the restaurant was top class and the rooms were clean. the business meetings went well but it support for audio and video was really bad. all together, i would give this hotel 5 out of 10."
"all you can eat concept restaurant. there is a lot to choose from however when busy order can come late or sometimes are delivered at the wrong table.  flavours are okay, nothing special, but nice to hang out with groups/kids."
"really nice setting, but paying 7,25 for a brownie i was expecting to get a nice big gooey brownie. instead i got 3 small 1cm by 1cm dried out brownie pieces with some less than average vanolla ice cream. extremely dissapointing. #ripoff"
"humphreys nijmegen recently moved to a new location. i always had good experiences at the old location. the new restaurant looks nice, but the service was a disaster! unpersonal, incompetent and slow. the restaurant is understaffed and the staff isnt well train "
had a three course dinner each for 27.95. we really were not impressed. good bread and dessert but the main dish of a mix grill and chicken was really bad. would not go back! over cooked and it didnt even match the description in the menu.
"straight forward reasonable priced meal, nothing bad and nothing extra ordinary.   lovely positioned by the river and staff very, very good, attentive, friendly and service minded."
