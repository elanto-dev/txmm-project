"very pleasant service, nice place but full deception with food. i travel a lot in many countries, italy too & its the worse i ever tested. lasagna without any taste at all, tiramisu still frozen in the plate, what a pity."
"the restaurant is situated at the south of amsterdam, named as amstelveen district. as the district does not have too many prime options, this place comes to top destinations in terms of ambiance. indoor and outdoor sitting options together with the design increases your expectatio "
"be aware the service staff is totally not trained or have even any experience, you have to wait a long time for your food, one point of time te waiter go and redo te string of his shoes without washing his hands he take the cutleries and serve the table i told mij wijf look at this and guess what happen he served our table i went en clean the cutleries first, than at 21.30 hr a whole tray of beer went in to the kitchen and all kitchen staff started to drink beer and wines. as said its manage as family business without service. the restaurant is so noisy and on top of this every 20 minutes your loud throughout the restaurant the happy birthday songs voor children parties of adult dinners , you want to have a nice dinner without stress this is sure not the place as the tables are packed on each other for that even the food is quite good but the rest you have to forget."
"this restaurant is a prime location for gorden ramsey to save! if you want to spend alot of money for an unripe tomatoe and fake mozerrela passing as bufola , wait two hours for soggy pasta in a puddel of canned tamatoe sause bought at the local supermarkt, be my guest as you will not be theirs as they do not care about you ,at all! the service was arrogant, extremely slow,and unresponsive. do youself a favor and look somewhere else. the are some great restaurants in the area, this is certianly not one."
"i went for take away pizza here in corona time. they were open for business which deserves a compliment. i wish i could say the same about the pizza. it was well below par - tasteless pie and cheap ingredients. i don’t know it this is related to the corona times, but i fear not. not recommended - there is plenty much better pizza around"
"we ordered pizza at home, it was disgusting. the ingredients are cheap as hell how dare you calling mozzarella a cheap cheese? never again, there are so many good places to eat, stay away from this one.."
"first time nearby town decided to try out this restaurant.  food: average, too much salt on my rib eye. overall texture was good.  the tiramisu is nice, balance taste and soft.  ambience: overall very comfortable environment, good for family gathering place. nice backyard."
"ambience of the restaurant was nice, service staff friendly.. unfortunately the food was. it up to m "
"nice ambiance. terribly slow service. staff does not look around to see if anyone needs service. we had to chase up staff for every step of the way: our first drink, for a menu-card, for ordering the food, for a dessert-menu card, for the dessert. my own main course was fine; my partners was much too salty. after again having had to wait for 10 minutes for someone to order our dessert we decided to leave without the dessert as no one was paying any attention to our attempts to snare a staff member. our total visit lasted 90 minutes in which we managed to drink 2 glasses of wine and have a main course; most of the time was spent on waiting and trying to attract attention from the staff. as no staff paid any attention we left our table to get the bill and pay at the till, where the staff member had the temerity to state we had only had to wait 5 minutes before being serv "

"with a colleague of mine we decided to have a dinner here during a business trip, after learning that the food was excellent. when we entered the restaurant we were not impressed by the atmosphere inside, which seemed a bit old and not entirely proper. the garden, however, was amazing and we sat outside with pleasure. it was a spacious garden with green view and wonderful sunshi "
"we came to the netherlands for a few days with my girlfriend. opposite our hotel there was this pizzeria. what a bad experience. the person who works there, the cook and the owner are all 1 person. loves money and only wants money. because he has no passion for food. how sad. ordered pizza and pasta that have nothing to do with italy. we were also not allowed to pay by card. the pin device was not on. we had to pay in cash. obliged. kind of scam. stay away from here"
this is honestly really awful. you cant call this pizzeria. pizza was really small compare to the amount. cheese was dirty and gross. supermarket pizza from the freezer tastes better than this. for all people this is really bad. last time here. not recommended
"small restaurant in the middle of amstelveen, right outside amsterdam. parking is a bit sketchy if you come by car. the restaurants interior is ok but nothing to write home about. we were there about 2 hours ago so everything is still fresh in my mind. because were a friday evening the restaurant was packed and extremely noisy. making a reservation is recommended. my wife and i had read good reviews so we went in with expectatio "
it was nice pizza and vibe but the manager was quite rude to the family beside us taking away the menus for the desert because they spent too much time make the pizza. the manager was verbally fighting back and not showing respect to the customers 
"kai the manager was already so rude on the phone that we were repelled straight away. even for dutch standards this is absolutely poor. asking me on the phone what time i want to join, me telling the time and then being told that actually theyre fully booked is not okay. why even bother to ask me then?! and then giving me a speech. not okay. either you have a table or not, but then please say so straight away and dont talk back to your guest and give an attitude."
"when we arrived the restaurant was full with families with kids. but we were offered a table at the window. they sell wine only by the glass of bottle, no caraf. the wine was great. they serve only pizza and no pasta. we ordered the diavola and four chees "
"i had a terrible experience with this pizza place today (order 13862907 made at amstelveen location - eleanor rooseveltlaan 2, 1183 cl amstelveen). even after waiting for more than 2 hours, did not get the pizza. however this is not the concern as this can happen at any shop and place, but what is concerning was the behavior of the delivery guy. this is the sequence of even "
"ordered side dishes and a dessert for delivery. website did not mention order must contain a pizza, and the order went through. waited for 1,5 hour then called and apparently our order was cancelled. they did not call/text/mail but thought it would be okay to let us starve..."
wanted to try something new - usually order from another place. pizza arrived half hour late and cold. when i called for complaining the operator put the phone on me. never use them again.... really sad to see such poor service. not sure if the franchise owner knows what is going on in amstelveen but it would be worth them to check in my opinion and do something - suggest to help stuff in better planning resources and send the operator to a ‘customer service 0.1 for beginners’ course...
"friday night dinners mostly consists of take-outs in our household. even though we do have our favourites were always keen to try new places. papa johns, even though part of a big american fast food chain opened in amstelveen recently so, we thought wed give it a go. walking in, there were quite a few glum looking people who seemed to have been waiting for some time. once you placed your order, a label with your name an order number is stuck on pizza boxes and then you wait...and wait. we went to albert hein close by to do a small shop, came back and waited some more. after another 15 minutes i was ready to ask for my money back but my son asked me to be patient. after about 45 min in total we got our pizzas and some sides. i must also add that the place lacks atmosphere with the staff moving about like theyre at a funeral...depressing to say the least! also, they dont use a wood fired oven but one of those cheap & nasty conveyor pizza ovens. getting home i expected the worst and wasnt disappointed...the pizzas were absolutely horrible! soft doughy soft base and the tomato sauce sour with a mingy amount topping...yuck "
"unpolite service, tasteless ingredients and terrible pizza. greasy cheese and soggy base. not recommended."
"nothing great to mention, staff isnt professional. not kip options to select from. its rather bland in nature with a crumpled sitting."
"it wasnt great at all, lacked salt. staff however was courteous. no kip item so to mention.  ..  .  .  ."
"this is one of the few real pizzerias in amstelveen. we visited it quite a few times and the atmosphere is relaxed and child friendly. the pizzas are of a good quality and thave he right size. the only thing i don’t understand is the change in the wine policy. formerly one could order wine in in a caraf of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 cl, but now you can order only bottles of wine. this not only is much more expensive but also offers less flexibility. so please change it!"
"once upon a time this was a nice, cheap and cheerful neighbourhood italian bistro but that time sadly appears to be gone. tasteless, awful, inedible food that for a large part appears to have been bought-in from some second-rate cash and carry outlet before being inexpertly warmed up. the waiter didnt seem to be at all surprised all three of the diners plates went back largely untouched, so i dont think think the current car crash is a sudden phenomenon."
"feels genuinely italian - children very welcome, you can watch the pizza dough being spun, pasta and risotto dishes very tasty."
"i dont recommend this restaurant for asiana family. we went there, and the waitresses treated us very rude. it was a kind of discrimination i feel. the treat local dutch people very nice, but not to asiana. i dont suggest asiana people to visit this restaurant."
"we visited this restaurant twice and both times the service was bad. very unfriendly and rude staff, but the food is really good."
"don’t go to this restaurant after 9:00 because you will probably get rude treatment. my husband and i were craving good italian so we came here. we arrived quite late because we were traveling far, so we understood the inconvenience. when we came in, everyone stared at us like we were the worst for coming in that late. we asked the waitress if it was too late and said we didn’t have to stay, but she said “we’re happy you’re here” and looked like she meant it so we thought, “great we’ll have a nice dinner but eat quickly so they don’t have to stay late for us. that was the last bit of friendliness we received. they sat us in the corner and took so long to bring menus or drinks. everyone else in the almost full restaurant was enjoying themselves and still eating when we sat down. the main waiter was refilling wine glasses, bringing people complimentary chocolates and laughing with other customers. obviously not in a hurry to leave. but he did not acknowledge us or welcome us. he just came by with a paper and looked at us to take our order. when he took it he left without a smile. we spent about $55 for the most uncomfortable, nice tasting italian food we’ve ever had. all we wanted to do was leave. they made us feel so out of place. we ate and left before some of the others had even finished their wine and they were still cold to us as we left. we couldn’t help but notice the waiter brought everyone a plate of chocolates with their check, but never brought us one. the food was fine but not worth it for our horrible experience. my husband ordered the pumpkin ravioli which doesn’t have meat but was still 16 euros. it was very good, but i ordered a pasta with “bacon” which ended up being thick pieces of pork that had a strange flavor. me least favorite meal of the whole trip. "
very popular restaurant  but the children enjoyed. not a brilliant location but near lots of housing.  service was good.

"veri sapori´s main attraction is passionate owner mario bianco. he´s a fun host and our first visit a year ago was a great experience. sadly, it seems the rave reviews soon after opening this restaurant has lead to complacancy. our last visit this month was a major disappointment. our waiter seemed uninterested. his choice of wine was totally off and the dishes were ok, but otherwise uninspiring. we could have done better cooking ourselves and we´re no master chefs. as the prices are quite hefty, we expect better from mario!"
if you can live with some traditional slow dutch service the food will compensate. fantastic pastas with the spaghetti vengole as the clear favorite in a nice ambiance with a lot of people despite the fact that we booked a table already at 1800. we will most likely be back but not at peak hours...
picture th 
food is very good but it takes very long till it’s delivered. very kind service! but very bad wifi. but the workers are very kind!
nothing special to say. an italian like so many others. their pizza was a bit too salty and prices are more on the high side for the quality. but ok got to fast although the restaurant was busy and the staff is rather courtious.
ordered via thuisbezorgd (home delivery) a cafoncella pizza. it was super salty and prosciutto di parma was just a normal ham you put on your bread in the morning. also my friend ordered salami pizza but it was just normal salami looking ham.
"we have been in this restaurant many times and love the food. however, they charge extra for things that leaves a bad feeli "
"we received delivery pizza from this place and it was inedible, we threw it in the bin and called the restaurant to complain. the base was limp, stale and tasteless, the topping was like lumps of salt in chewy cheese."

"for an italian restaurant, i would say on average the food was disappointing. the main course fish was very good, the arancini i had as a starter were tasteless. wine was nice and the staff are very friendly but not very experienced and didnt seem to have much training. location looked nice but we only got a seat in the bar area as the main restaurant with the nice view was full."

after waiting for 20+ minutes on just one drink before anyone cared to take our order. then we waited for 50 more minutes only to find out that they had completely forgotten about us. as you can imagine i do not advice going there if you actually want to eat. 
i had the pizza marinara and it was ok but relied too heavily on tinned fish. the vegetable lasagne was better. the service was not very good; there being one person other than the cook doing everything. and he struggled. it was a cold wet monday when we visited so i expect they were not anticipating the ten customers there.
"with 2 friends (total a party of 4) and a bill of 180 for a small piece of meat for me, a large piece of salmon and 2 plates of pasta. the potatoes were old and the sauces were so, so. the waiter was friendly but his co-worker (a young lady of about 25) was very insecure. no typical italian atmosphere. the website looks fine, the menu looks fine, but in th real world: i am never going back to that restaurant. not worth. no value for money."
"the restaurant is now called “trattoria italiana diga”. my review? terrible service and terrible food! we sat at the terrace as the weather was quite good (for april). the waitress came quite quickly to take our order (spaghetti with mussels and gambas, spaghetti with tomato sauce (kid portion) and a pizza tonno). the two orders of spaghetti arrive. first comment: i asked mine to be served with spicy sauce. never ate such a blend spaghetti even after adding more salt and pepper. impossible to eat it. my husband’s pizza was nowhere to be seen even after 10 min of our orders being served. we waited and waited, until i decided to call again the waitress (another one came). we asked for the pizza, spicy olive oil and parmesan. we had to wait another 10 min until the pizza arrived (letting us guess that the order had never been placed). the spicy olive oil? i had to ask for it again (btw: my pasta was served with just half a dozen gambas, the mussels were missing in combat!). the parmesan? never came. the pizza was as blend as my spaghetti and the lack of “spicy” in the spicy olive oil didn’t help in my already stretched patienc "
"went there for diinner because we saw the menu posted outside and it looked great. a waiter greeted us and told us to have a seat anywhere and he would find us. we seated ourselves and never saw the waiter again. after about ten minutes of waiting to be served and our dirty table cleaned, we finally had to flag down a waiter to order. we placed our order and the food was deliverd by another waiter. we ate our complete meal without anyone asking how our meal was or do we need anything else. i looked for a waiter to get our check and finally we got the attention of a person and they told us to go inside to pay. and by the way, we asked for a couple of glasses of tap water and was told that was not available, only by the bottle for sale. yes, they got us.. i eneded up buying one without asking the price...5 euros. we are here in town for 4 more nights and we wont return."
"very nice place, but after 1h i’m still sitting here and no one has served us anything. asked once to the blond waitress working on saturdays and i have to say i’m amazed by how rude she was. about the food i have no clue, i’ll let you now if they bring it."
really bad service. we’ve waited for 45min and nothing was served. i’ll never come back and seriously won’t recommend.
the service was slow. not enough staff on the floor. asked which cheeses were on the plate. waiter didntt know. had as main course pasta 4 formagi. no flavour on it and when i said that to the waiter. i got extra gratin cheese to give it a little bit of flavour. the interieur is out dated. they have a wonderfull place. hopefully they make something out of this. by
"i have been quite a few times to this restaurant and the pizzas have always been good (see my review from january 2015 which was very positive). my visit yesterday however will be my last. the pizza menu has drastically changed, and not for the better. the choice includes some very strange combinations, none of which appealed to me. i made my own choice of topping therefore (i used to order their fine frutti do mare). the pizza that arrived was very poor indeed. thin base, barely cooked on the middle, a smear of tomato sauce and a topping very meager on the fish front. there should have been salmon, mussels and anchovies but almost none of the above were to be found. what was a lot of were cherry tomatoes, olives and basil leaves. possibly the worst pizza i have every eat "

"okay, this is one of the few restaurants in town, so it is always a take it or leave i "
nice patio out front to watch the people go by in this little town. we were there for lunch and only had sandwiches but the italian menu looked to have a large selection. service was okay they seem to either own the other few restaurants on the street as the waitress kept running back and forth between them and they had to run next door to get the credit card machine.

"set in lovely surroundings this trattoria unfoortunately is simply average and given the final bill even overpriced. it has a a very average choice of items on the menu, all of course based on the italian cuisine. we selected a 4 course surprise menu but afterwards kind of regretted our choice: unspectacular grilled tuna, followed by an average pasta and mediocre steak. there seemed to be a lot more attractive items on the menu but we didnt taste those and hopefully they are prepared with more passion and ingenuity than what we were served. the staff is very kind though, perhaps a little popular, and the wines were really nic "

lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
my pizza was extremely salty. it tasted extremaly bad. my friends took calzone and it also tasted very poorly. big portions but it was so bad that i ate less than half. i do not recommend this restaurant. moreover the waitress was not nice.
"proseco foscari, stale, no bubles from what appears to be some from ope left over. bottle. minuscule portion of ravioli, oily, tasteless. 8 pieces, 10, luckwarm, oily and tasteless. menu 15, but charged 16.50. seafood pasta, a lot of spahetti, many shells but some with nothing in it, empty shells. oily, little taste. very limited menu, no pizzas. dutch beers not available. one of the worse dining experience and we left halfway, paying a hefty bill for what was in essence not good food and way too expensive in comparisson with pro eran restsurant near by. they will not see me again."
"the salmon filet was but skin and bones, and when we brought it to the attention of the waitress she said shed tell the cook. there was no response until the cook-owner came by and my husband mentioned again that the salmon was very tough and primarily bones. the owner then reacted in a very unprofessional way: he lost his temper and grabbed all of our plates away - even the half eaten one of our elderly mother, who was protesting that she wanted to finish her food. to no avail. the other people next to us were so shocked by witnessing this that they said they would never come back again. we have never had such an awful experience befo "
"this used to be a nice restaurant, the last delivery was so bad. it took over 90 minutes for the delivery, and not only did we get wrong order, it was also disgusting. be aware if you ordered here before, it has become a low budget restaurant with very bad service and quality. don’t make the same mistake as us thinking they made good pizza’s, unfortunately this is not the case anymore. also they did nothing to solve the problem, people move on to the next restaurant to find your pixza."
"we ordered 2 calzone for delivery on 13-12-2021. they arrived and while the first few bites were ok, in the middle it was completely cold. just little unmelted square blocks of cheese. we called to complain and were offered replacements, but to be truthful after eating almost half there was no point in starting another. i asked if we could have a credit for next time, but that was not possib "
"good taste, good price, good service but . "
"this is a horrible time to own a restaurant. the government restrictions on gatherings means closure for the restaurant world. what is left is take-away or home delivery. i have chosen the latter three times since the summer from fratelli voorburg, the latest being yesterday eveni "
food good but the service was so slow.we waited for nearly an hour for our starters. i would recommend the for atmosphere and food.
"reservation made but when we arrived staff were not interested! however there were plenty of available tables. it is somewhat confusing that there is a fratelli i and fratelli ii restaurant side by side! food good, service average. incorrect bill presented at the end of the meal."
"fratelli is a good italian restaurant. the staff is friendly and the service is good. we tried the pizza and it was also good. conclusion: fratelli is a good, but nothing of special italian restaurant"
"restaurant is okay, location is fine, parkingplace at 5 min.walk, nice area. inside is traditional, brownish. there are 2 restaurants, in number two we (6 and kid) were, and it is i guess the part where they put groups and familys together, which makes it very noisy. the planning is very poor, it took a long time before they took the order, and the people after us, even two tables, got their meal first. not one time they came at the table to ask for anything, and we tried, but could not get some more wine before the end of the meal. it really takes away the pleasure of going out to dinner. not unfriendly, but not friendly either. we left without desert nor coffee, which is exceptional. not coming back here. food is okay, average."
"i absolutely love their food. the pizza is excellent, especially the pizza carpaccio, i love to do a take away there. but their planning is horrible, service isnt so good. a few points of improvement and they will score 4 points for me!"
reception was ok. wardrobe is far too small and the tiles on the floor underheath are dirty!! im glad i have not visited the toilet. upon entering our name was checked and a nice table was given. between fireplace and aquarium. there is a place on coaches to wait for your table if it is bu 
we visited the restaurant as a family and were looking for good vegetarian italian food. the choices were limited but we really liked what we got. the service was very prompt and friendly.
friendly but a little dark and faded but the food is good. pizzas are all good value and freshly prepared. wont break the bank and you can always get a seat.
"this is a pizza place with a pizza cook who does this for many many years. we never eat there anything other than pizza, for other food we go to other restaurants. value for money and simple. do not go there to have an exclusive business dinner."
"this is probably the explanation for an  inordinate love of chopped leek on pizza. the food is isnt bad, the restaurant isnt really enticing, but you end up having an acceptable meal in a rather cosy little place."
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone.

"nice and friendly reception, the starters were good and promising. unfortunately, the mains were disappointing. it was obviously not the best day for the cook. however, service was good."
this food is only italian for people who have never eaten italian.. low quality cooking with overcooked lasagna drowning in sauce and fast-food level pizza... profoundly disappointed
i dine it here and at the same time ordered for delivery and i can say that this resto is quiet good especially for average budget.
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"frozen pizza, shameful for a restaurant called italian. glass of water that costs 2.10 euros ... run away !"
"have been  a regular here for years. the house pizza is a favourite. other dishes, all italian cuisine, are at least satisfactory or good. the house wine is plonk, but service and atmosphere compensate for that."
"this pizza restaurant that is located in the center of town close to the main shopping street, bars and cafe "
we was here at a sunday. they was about to close but we got pizzas. very friendly waiters. the bosses are good an tasty. outside sitting possible. prices are too high for pizza. from 12 euro and up.
"the drinks were generous and cheap. the food was inedible. thats all i have to say. i have had inedible food about twice in my life thats how bad it was. i would give no stars if possible. my husband and i had totally different meals and his was also awful. i ordered a salad which never came probably good my husbands salad was disgusting, watery. plus we waited 30 minutes for our food with no one in the restaurant!"
"very nice prices at this restaurant. it has italian food plus mexican, pizza, and a good mixture of other entrees. i had a glass of house wine for $3.50 and canneloni for $9.50. max entrée price was under $20."
i paid 30€ for 2 pizza and after 2days still dont have food no food no money back !! guy on reception cant speak english
"very good caprese, but not a great pizza nor atmosphere. prices are relatively high for the quality. service is friendly."
"great italian food. great italian atmosphere. great value for money. was very busy, but we could sit at the last unreserved table. food and drinks italian style. fast service, fast food and good prices."
"went here expecting to have a good dining experience, unfortunately the service was disappointing. the waiters were friendly and helpful, however we got the impression they couldnt cope with all the guest they were serving. we ordered some bread which they forgot and brought after our main dish had arrived, then i ordered some wine and they brought us water. regarding the quality of the food, i wasnt really impressed about it, the meat i ordered was very dry and there was an excess of sauce. definitively in my opinion this place is not worth the visit."
"on our holidaytrip, we stopped at la trattoria in castricum. sitting on a terrace, we had a nice dinner. the food was good, the service fine and the price was fair."
"based on reviews and hearsay we decided to give this trattoria a try. i must say we had a very pleasant evening. the ambiance and the service is more then ok a very friendly and helpfull staff. as for the food i have some remarks. yes everything tasted fine (not spectacular), portion sizes where ok, but in comparison with the prices asked it did not fit the picture completely. when getting a vitello tonato for € 13,50 i expect more, same goes for the grilled fish platter for € 26,50 a person. as said, we did have a nice evening, but at this price level i expect to be more surprised whit what is coming out of the kitchen. will i go back, i think yes, i would like to give it another try with different dishes, hopefully that can change my mind."
innesto has a nice a outside setting making it a good summer choice. i was not hugely impressed with the actual food however the menu is attractive and the service is good.
friendly staff with quick service. quality of food is reasonable. restaurant is located in nobis hotel
"nice place near highway, very good service and decorations in restaurant but food not very good. i order burger all would be ok meat i not minced much too much and have sticky taste. i don;t know what they put inside but was very strange. rest of meal was ok"
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"we thought this would be a nice idea for the kids, they like these kind of all you can eat buffets. they loved the idea of the themed environment in different restaurant styles, so abc seemed for them the summ "
this is an all you can eat buffet restaurant. all the food is cooked and displayed. as you can expect from a buffet restaurant things cool off or taste less than when cooked fresh. some stations offer fresh made dishes. this is a family restaurant. don’t expect quality food or service. essentially overpriced but a nice experience for kids who like to eat different dishes.
"staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. we paid €92 for two adults and a teenager, no drinks. the food was very overpriced for the quality. the desserts were ok, many of the meats / main dishes seemed dried out. we don’t plan on returning to this restaurant. "
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"definitely a place to avoid. food is expensive and of average quality. service is mediocre and staff, especially the owners, are arrogant. when we visited, the sewer system left a distinctive smell but the staff wasn’t bothered to reac "

"the pizza on your plate is very good, tasty, crisp bottom, but the surroundings do not improve the experience. the sound of people talking buzzes around in the area. if there are groups/tables with a larger number of clients that order at the same time, the kitchen can not cope with it. the waitresses could have a better feeling if you need e.g. a new drink by walking around in stead of grouping near the counter."
"the staff is really family oriented, efficient and very friendly. food is ok. good to reserve before going."
"for my mother in law’s birthday, we went to porto maurizio in heythuysen. we arrived at 18:15 and got our starter around 18:45. the three of us ordered pizza (not too difficult to prepare), but it took the chefs more than one hour and 25 minutes to get out pizza’s out on our table. the pizza tasted okay, but i’ve had better at porto maurizio’s. if you ask me now, i’m in doubt if i will come and eat here again."
"this is a great place on the boarder of the netherlands and germany, with an excellent selection of ice creams (my favourites - the spaghetti ice in different versions) and coffees. friendly personnel."
i had a decent italian meal..fro. the portion to the taste it was pure italian. the service was quick and friendly. good view in the calm vaals..and they do home delivery
"we stayed for 1 night in hotel bilderberg. their restaurant was full so we had to look for something else. we went to della mamma. nice cousy italian restaurant. the staff is very friendly. we ordered carpaccio and pasta. all was good. if you look more for a fancy italian then this is not the place, but for pizza, pasta nice cousy place it is."
"not a bad pizza for dutch standards, but clearly no wood fired stone oven stuff. tiramisu was quick good. nice garden seating at the back. service was ok."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didn’t seem to care. won’t be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
located in a small town in friesland right on a little river. this italian restaurant offers typical dishes like pasta and piz 
a fine italian restaurant. do not expect haute cuisine. but thats fine. just a no-nonsense italian restaurant. with surprising dishes and pizzas
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
"we enjoyed our simple italian meal in this very convenient restaurant for the return ferry to harwich. however, we were stunned to be charged 9 euros for a bottle of still water. the bill was first marked up as 7 euros and then changed to 9. when we queried it we were told water is expensive in holland. its not."
pizzas are expensive here so my expectations were high. at least that a pizza is enough for a complete me 
really rude ! 
"friendly staff, but they never came to check on us to ask how the food was or to check if we needed more drinks. missed chance! the food was tasty, but oh, so very slow... too bad!"
"1. on arriving we were pressed for a drink order and not knowing what we yet wanted simply asked for plain table water while we decided. of course they delivered over priced bottled water. when we responded that if we had to pay for something, it would be something we wanted. the waitress, rather than being polite was haughty and arroge "
"the way these guys are treating there customers is the worst i’ve ever seen in europe! we came 20 minutes before 9 pm, just want to have beer, coffee and desserts. they did not tell us about the rule, we’ve been waiting for 15 minutes, after our question at 2055 they told a us that we still need to wait! full ‘flexibility’ is there seems! then at 2105 the manager came to our table - i’ve asked her very politely not to ruin the evening for the people close by and speak inside. but she insisting on talking at the spot and we’ve been talking for another 15 minutes, rather then just receiving the ord "
if you want to enjoy a good italian pizza go to la terrazza. the service is ok and the prices are average for bergen.its location is right in the center of the village and easy to find.
"everything here is so-so. because of their prime location, the incentive to try harder apparently lacks. has been a few months since i visited so maybe its different now #benefitofthedoubt"
what we experienced in this restaurant is beyond any acceptable level. until our presence had been noticed i took already quite a while. the drinks took as long as in a normal restaurant the food does. after about forty minutes since ordering a wrong salad came. usually the personel would say sorry and look that everrhing goes smoothly from that point. instead we kept on waiting. after our wish to pay the drinks and go we got a promise that our food comes within a minute. the tomato salad then came. after that was eaten up the pizzas were still missing. in my entire life i never had to leave a restaurant due to such a bad service. montagne was my premiere in that matt 
"went here with mr. husband and little one (2yo). we were early (5pm) which ment that we were the only ones there. had to eat outside as inside was too hot after a recent heat wave, but the outside dining area is directly next to the main road through town, so it is very busy and little one could not walk around. also two servers were continously standing in the doorway watching us. i can understand they want to see whether someone else comes in but i felt very watched. they spoke italian to each other. on the one hand i like an italian restaurant ran by italians, on the other hand i like to understand what the ones watching me are saying "
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"the place is nice and cosy, and the people are very nice and friendl "
we were 3 adults and two small kids who all had pizza. it was tasty but nothing out of the ordinar 
"we love the food here, everything is beautifully made and presented so has an amazing kitchen. it’s a little on the pricy side here for it’s location. staff are good but always seem very serious so come across very frosty. we must have been there about 30 times last year and we still don’t raise much of a smile from the staff - maybe they hate us! ;)"
"we went there on a saturday evening to have a small dinner. the restaurant appears to be a snack bar with some tables. we ordered steaks, which were very very tough and way overcooked. the spaghetti carbonara was uneatable salty. the sharma was to salty and too much."
"the food was acceptable. i have only taken food out with this restaurant, and it was so so. the pizza that i ordered was not what i was expecting, and it was soggy by the time i got home (10 min drive). i would not be eating here again."
"the food was quite okay. the hostess, nonna, is wonderfully charming. the reason for a terrible rating is that we asked for 2 simple glasses of water for our 2 thirsty boys and were presented for expensive bottled mineral water. the waitress forgot to mention they refuse to serve tapwater. that was her mistake. what angers me is the policy of refusal of tap water. bottled water is pollution for it is carried from afar whilst excellent dutch tap water isnt. and why? because centerparcs wants to squeeze you for every buck in your pocket and doesnt give anything about our childrens future environment. so please stop advertising how much action you take for being green. it is just another one of your custumor luring schemes."
terrible at best. we waited over an hour for food. carbonara was covered in spring onions... they made another for us but it was bland and gloopy. salmon pasta was the same sauce with smoked salmon on top. ive had far better microwave meals. lasagne was ok. the only saving grace was our waitress who was lovely and clearly embarrassed. we could hear all the tables around us complaining... pizza which you could barely cut through. extortionately priced for the quality.
"organizational skills are hardly up to par. antipasta was served ages before getting our first drinks. pizzas were ok, but the pasta was, besides only being able to opt for penne (which is highly unlikely as pasta for bolognaise), extremely boring and had too little salmon to even mention it a salmon sauce. tasteless and no pepper on the table to spice it up. dessert time was no more satisfying than the prior experiences: the dame blanche could hardly be called a db, the kids cocktail was simple an alcohol-free fizzy drink, the bourbon was served in a gin glass that couldnt fit the ice cube and the aperol was so watery that i am hydrated for the next coming days. wish we would have read the reviews beforehand. this cannot be called an italian restaurant if restaurant at all!"
"we had wait for 20 minutes before anyone came to even take our order and then they got out first order wrong. we took two kids 3-course, a lasagna and another main course and salad. the food was ok without being good. for the kids desert tiramisu there were ice crystals in the ice cream, so either was an old ice cream or not properly stored. all in all, average food and average service in a park where food options are limited"
"it took over an hour for 1 pizza and 2 daily simple pasta dishes to arrive. no apologies from the staff who seemed to prefer to stand and chat to each other rather than serve the customers. our waitress asked us 3 times if we’d ordered - the answer was yes every time and surely when you only have 2 tables to cover you can remember that you’d been and asked us twice before?!finally gave them an ultimatum that if our food didn’t arrive in the next 5 mins we were leaving, it miraculously appeared. bolognaise was dreadful and the tagliatelle was very undercooked. will definitely not be returning during our stay and it has put us off the other restaurants at center parcs port zélande."
1 pizza + 1 pasta 4 cheeses took more than one hour to arrive and it was overcooked... nonna came to see us at the beginning but never came bac 
food took over an hour to arrive and when it did we had to eat separately as the meals arrived at different times. the order had also been taken incorrectly and we were given a kiddies tomatoe pasta instead of an adults bolognaise. the waiter refused to change the orde 
"the food was horrible and ridiculously overpriced  service was bad too, we waited for more than an hour for very basic dishes.a real disappointment"
"i want to review this place in all fairness so let me start by saying i had a very nice pasta meal at this restaurant. then i ordered a take away pizza and the cheese was a bit salty; definitely not the mozzarella which is traditionally used for most real italian pizza. i went in for another take away pizza and asked them if they could use mozzarella; the owner informed me all pizza is made with gouda 48+ cheese and that they’ve been doing it for 40 years. that put me off. if you don’t care about truly traditional authentic italian pizza i guess it’s ok as a dutch cheese pie dish but for me it’s a big no no, especially as on its website the restaurant claims to serve authentic/traditional italian cuisine. obviously, dutch gouda cheese is not used in authentic italian cuisine as far as i know."
"we heard there was glutenvrij opties here. so we headed over there, around 5p. well, the food took over an hour to come out and if we didnt ask where our food was, we would still be waiting. i feel they overbooked and could not handle all the orders that night. they definitely forgot about us, my two young daughters were starving, not nice. i had to find a waiter for drinks, unreal. anyway, the food eventually came out. i had a glutenvrij pizza. it was absolutely horrific! just being honest. i usually eat or finish anything that is put in front of me. but this is the first time in my life, that i could not even come close to finishing a dinner. it tasted so horrific, and overwhelmingly salty, i couldnt believe they actually brought this out. it was like a salt pizza. i was so embarrassed for them and couldnt bare to tell them. i know we complained and they did something for us, maybe we didnt pay, dont remember. this occurred last year sometime. i will never go back. my wifes food was just not the best either. not a good night out."
"we were both disappointed. nothing felt like it has just been made. everything had the taste and texture of bought food heated and plated. the cheese sauce was awful; sorry, but it was. the soup was definitely more put together than made, and soup isnt difficult. we would not go there again."
i heard good opinions but found myself disappointed. we ordered focaccia e pane - we got regular bread /not a focacc 
"the food was absolutely fabulous, but the staff are just rude and unfriendly; no idea how to be good hosts; its a shame as it takes away from the excellent food thats being served; will not be going back because of the staff"
"now and than we order for take-out, in general acceptable quality, not top class. the last time it was really not worth the money, far too expensive, 2 simple pizzas for € 24.50"
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
"i went there recently and ordered a vegetarian dish because i am vegetarian for 10 years. they brought me a pasta that i was supposed should have bbq vegi chicken, i started to eat and i feel this vegi chicken is very similar to real one, tola my friend their product is as similar as real chicken but ask my friend to test it and she told no i think it is the real chicken, i was shocked , the worst answer that i expected,i asked the staff to check my dish and he told sorry we made a mistake!? just sorry ?!and the funny and awful response of them offering me a coupon for a dessert??!! what they think?! i was in a bad mood mentally and physically but i think the first option should change my food and make new one but when i rejected the dessert offer ,they just put 14 euro on my table and collect the food of my friend also , she was between of her dish, it seems they just want us to leave the restaurant and don’t say anything about they fault! it is so unprofessional and offensive behavior of their staff! i don’t want to go there anymore and tell to all of my friends to don’t go there. i don’t suggest there at all!!!"
"tried happy italy in schiedam. and wow, horrendous. i ordered a pasta carbonara and a pizza with chicken, paprika and red onion. the chicken on the pizza was of the lowest possible quality and had no taste at all. i wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to anyone."

"visited with friends after an escape room on a friday night. place was packed,service a bit long.we were 25 mins late but they waited for us,which was nice. my pasta carbonara was overly greasy,with bad quality pancetta. the rest of my group had different pizze,no one was really amazed by any of  "
"everything o.k., however nothing outstanding. so for a simple, straight forward meal well recommended. the interior of the restaurant is very original!"
good location - 9/10 nice ambiance - 7/10 friendly staff - 7/10 average food quality - 5/10 value - 7/10 expected a better quality of food
"had to wait over an hour and a half for a simple pizza, apparently because a risotto was dropped of one of my party. no apologies.  risotto was pretty mediocre, pizza okay."
"we decided to have our christmas dinner at restaurant de olifant in breukelen. we searched for multiple venues in the region and went with de olifant after having read the positive reviews online, despite the fact that it was on the more expensive end of the set we looked  "
"we went to this place because it was mentioned that they cook italian cuisine. the place is nice, the surrounding is beautiful (at the river vecht), the service was fine. however, the food was ok, it only reminds me far away what the taste would have been if the restaurant was located in italy. making italian food with a dutch swing, is a pity."
"i have eaten here before and it was lovely, not this time. we went for the shared dining and had a discount as well, maybe that is why. the bread and dips were great. the starter had good variation. there were mussels, cooked too long and calimari that were way too salty. there was a tomato salad with no flavor at all, but the piece of smoked mozzerlla was divine. the sauteed mushrooms were very nice. the rest of the table had some ham and vitello tonato(made with fricandau instead of veal) but i have a pork allergy, so i had a bruschetta with carpaccio, very tasty. it took a long time for the nect course to come and drinks were not refreshed. when the main course arrived, we were given the wine menu, as asked for. the cod and risotto was quite good, but the other course was pork and vegetables. i got some vegetables, and the sauce was so salty, it was inedible. the wine order was not taken. finally, after another long wait, dessert, again lots of choice. some ice-cream, nothing wrong with that. tje creme brulee and tiramisu were extremely bland. the chocolate mousse was nice, and the topping on the panna cotta was superb, but the basis tasted only of sweet. another long wait for the coffee, one of us received a cappuccino imstead of a latte and none of the coffee was very good. i really hope this was just a bad day, and not an indication that the quality is declining. "
"location is superb. ample parking. food sizes are european and more than enough when you dont want to overeat. service was friendly. tastes were fine. desert was to die for. and then again... this could be so much better if someone with knowledge of interior decoration could do over this place. the colors on the wall, floors, furniture, signs, lighting fixtures, curtain rails, bathrooms, ... it is eclectic and not warm. missed opportunity to make the look and feel of the place in sync with the aspiration on the culinary field and service. this makes the price/quality poor."
"while on a visit to our daughter, in breukelen, we dined at de olifant. what a disappointme "
"the food is horrible! you think that it would be good because its got 4.4 stars on google, but its disgusting. we ordered a minestrone soup and a four cheese pizza and were disgusted about how they turned out. the minestrone soup was just broth, not a soup. the four cheese pizza tasted like boiled plastic. overall, the food tasted very bad, and tasted more mediterranean than italian. do not trust the rating!"
"we ordered a pizza, calamari, and parmigiana. all three dishes were absolutely not tasty. calamari was so over-fried and tasteless that we send them back. the pizza bread was good but the topping tasted awful. the same for parmigiana - no parmesan, few pieces of eggplant and tomatoes, and lots of cheap chee "
"at around 8pm on friday (29-03-2019) night we wanted to have some dessert and a drink. we went into the restaurant and the manager told us that they didnt have any vacant tables. when i looked around and pointed at several vacant tables, he told us that the kitchen was closed (at 8pm! really?). their desserts were on display in the vitrine, so i told him that they dont need the kitchen to serve us desserts and drinks. nevertheless, he refused to sit us without giving a proper reason. all he said is that he had to stop somewhere (whatever it means). we live close by, so we could be regular customers in that place, but there is no way that we will ever go there again. the way they treat customers is disgusting. also, a couple of times we had ordered a pizza to go there, which was just average."
"we have a last minute diner and we decided to this at this restaurant. the staff helped us correctly, which was very nice. however, they have asked us only once for drinks. the customer service should be better. pizza was very tasteful but my salmon was over cooked. and it wasn’t seasoned correctly. i couldn’t give them a tip because my overall experience was too low unfortunately. next time better, i hope. "
had dinner last week with some colleagues.  pasta was perfectly ok but nothing amazing.   the restaurant is comfortable & spacious.   portions are a good size.
"we were there 3 times. first time everything was perfect - food and service.so we came back .second time we ordered the same things like on the first time ; entrecote with patatoes and warm( caramelised) vegetables and lasagne,and tea( very good tea and a lot of flavor too choose) , and here we go "
we went there as a group of 4 friends; we took a starter a main course dessert beers bottle of wine and expres 
"i don’t think i’ll be back any time soon, the pistacho pesto pasta was bland and slightly uncooked; clearly prepared by someone who doesn’t have a passion for food.. the pizza was ok: crunchy crust but slightly salty, nothing special. staff was kind but inexperienced."
"we visited with hubby and little one, when my mom visited from greece. we know italian food and were not delighted with what they served but neither disappointed. some of the plates were good and some were blah! waiter was very friendly. wine lovely. kids friendly too. not bad for an afternoon after shipping when you havent got any time to cook ;)"
the food is nothing special and quite honestly the pizza tastes like it was a frozen pizza and the pasta was bland. i wouldnt recommend this place at all.
"spent an evening here with colleagues. we were a group of 6, and arrived at around 19:00. service is friendly, and the atmosphere is nice. the speed of service however, isnt amazing. we received our starters around 21:00, and our main course around 21:30. one of our collegues unfortunately had to leave before his main course arrived, he hadnt expected to have to wait close to two hours for his fo "
"the atmosphere is nice and the service friendly. the food is average, at least what we had. we had a pizza (ive really tried better pizzas before), cannelloni (at least average), tuna filet (not bad) and a beef filet with pepper sauce (not bad)."
"under new management for about three years now, the restaurant now offers good italian food sicilian style (rather than northern italian, from where the former owner originated). pleasant atmosphere; nice view of the old rijswijk church from the window tables and terrace, the restaurant is currently also open for lunch. "
"upscale italian restaurant with italian owner who gives a lot of attention to his guests. fairly long wait times for the food, expect to spend the better part of an evening. good wines. the menu looks very interesting, but i have to say the taste of teh food was rather average, on the bland side. no real taste surprises. "
"we ordered 6 pizzas, and they were not good at all. the dough was very dry and the toppings were very scanty. moreover, it took them over 1.5 hours to get to us (2 km away). i would definitely not recommend this venue."
"ordered here using the just eat website. we ordered a big hawai pizza and a medium chicken pizza. service was fast, pizzas arrived within 20 minutes. the hawai pizza was not so special, the chicken shoarma pizza was very nice though, very tasty with the garlic sauce. prive was 22 euros. maybe i would eat the chicken pizza someday but im not sure if i would try this place again. the website is by the way fellinispizzarijswijk.nl"
"the food is ok, but the place needs a facelift and the service is terrible. they forgot our drinks order several times! this place is not really recommendable…"
not much to say here. on my quest to find a decent delivery pizza in the hague this ranks straight to the bottom. probably the worse pizza i ve ever had
pizza dough is strange.. its kind of gummy. i took the new york pizza because i wanted to try something different. id youre looking for an italian pizza stay away from this place. imo prices are a bit high for the size of the pizza.
"me and my girlfriend went there to have a nice italian meal. a trattoria typically push on a condensed menu with high quality raw materials, here instead there was everything (including pizza) and low quality. we took an home appetizer to share: fried squids + mushrooms + prosciutto and salami + carpaccio and roastbeef. all in one dish fish and meat, really no sense. salami were really low quality and high margin products. then we ordered gnocchi alla sorrentina which were overwhelming of garlic and rigatoni salciccia e funghi with super liquid cream and parsley, i had acidity after few minutes. then we ordered a seabass, which was ok, and ossobuco which was good but with a ragu really acid. service was below par but justifiable by the fact that they were all very young and unexperienced (f.i. forks and knife posed on the table with no napkin). the place itself is decent with a nice terrace but food is really bad"
"pizzas was not dry and tasteless. all in family had different pizzas, only one was decent. in addition the wait for the food was very long."
i have been to many italian pizzas but rarely have i had such a disgusting pasta as this one. pasta from a pack which had barely been cooked served with a mushroom sauce from a pack. my partners pizza was less disgusting but still pretty bad. will never come back.
"we thought we would spend the last night of our holiday at somewhere special, what an error! the decor and ambiance is fine, thats where it ends.20 minutes after we arrived we managed to order 4 starters, only 3 turned up, had to reorder. we chased the staff to order wine, the montepulciano was not available i asked for the waitress advice on an equivalent dont know dont drink red she sa "
"we ordered pizzas to go. it took nearly an hour to have them ready when the restaurant was almost empty and the waiter was not particularly friendly.  the pizzas were good, but i dont think well come back. i wish them good luck."

"besides the nice settings and location, the food and service were absolutely horrible!! the hostess was extremely rude and the waitresses were very inexperienced. the food was even worse. we ordered veal escalope with white wine & lemon dressing and it was not even remote to what we expected. the dry and tough meat was nasty and they gave us a separate plate with extremely dry and overcooked vegetables. well, not even a decent plate of food, but more like 2 pieces of broccoli, 3 disgusting potatoes and a piece of mango on the side. the portions were also very very sma "

"pizza was nice, thin and crispy. but seafood spagetti was not fresh and too much garlic, not to my like."
"doppio espresso is situated in the covered shopping center koningshoek in maassluis. this shopping center has the advantage of all weather shopping and lots and lots of free parking. doppio espresso has an inviting appearance with tables inside and outside in the wide passage. not unexpected through the name of the establishment italian food and drinks are offered and efforts are made to create an italian atmosphere. i settled for a common black coffee, because i didnt want to experience the disappointment of an inadequate espresso and it was too late for a cappuccino. cannoli were on offer and i couldnt resist ordering one. the cannolo was better than expected, but the envelope was a bit hard. generally a good effort was made by the staff to create an italian atmosphere, but unfortunately the eye watering prices were very un- italian. a three point rating."
"i always order delivery for this bussiness. from all the orders throughout the year. i think there has only been one order that was delivered with all the add ons as i ordered. i thought after two months or so, i give it another try. i never posted a review.today was the last straw, the two pizzas i ordered one was correct. the second pizza was once again not the one i ordered, a conpletely different one. i contacted the company: i requested the correct pizza for free this time, maybe not to friendly. they did not agree to that since they have no registration of the previous incorrect orders, despite them once having given me a free order after an earlier debacle. might be because i order without an account. a dessert was offered, i refused that. now i got the correct order, however still with a spice i specified not to add. once you get the pizza the quality is good, but okay considering pricing. for me this was the straw that broke the camels back for the delivery option. i dont know if they give the wrong order to the delivery person or that it already goes wrong when reading the order.i am just one customer, but how unlucky can you get? i used to recommend this pizzeria to friends and family, but i will no longer do so."

very bad and aggressive owner !!!! bad food and sour peppers 🌶  and he got mad because if it crazy never seen this before!
"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"
"cucina elena is located in vleuten, very close to vleuten train station. this is not a place for tourists but for locals who are either regulars or candidates to be regulars. we arrived at cucina at 17:35-17.40 and ordered 2 pizzas. we got our pizzas at 18:00. for a place which only has 4 tables inside (1 of them was empty when we ordered), this is really really long. the place is quite small so on a cold day, it might be chaotic with all the people who wait inside and there is no place to move, also for the staff. we arrived home and the pizzas are already got half-cold (we traveled by car for 6 minutes) . the crust around the pizza was so hard it was breaking and hurting your mouth when you bite. last but not least, according to the quattro formaggi description, i was expecting to taste gorgonzola which i did not at all. actually all i could taste was simple cheese "
nice restaurant to go to with your children and family. good italian food. easy close by parking. saturday live music and lively atmosphere.

"this location (maarssen) did not answer the phone, twice. then tried to order online. in my basket each pizza is suddenly €1.50 more expensive than listed. then tried calling the paid number. it asked my zip code to then bluntly tell me there is no location near me (seriously?) and hung up on me. congratulations with the worst customer service experience we had in a long time.

"we were recommended this place and were disappointed. pizza (margherita) was mediocre at best, and wasnt cheap too. some slices didnt have any cheese on them, just tomato sauce."
ordered a pizza with tuna. bottem was very soft and the topping poorly. tomato sauce tasted very artificial. something from a jar. asked for garlic on my pizza. they dont have that. rather strange for a pizzeria.

"dirty tables, very slack service and a few of the courses featuring on the menu where not available, such as the small pizza. seems this could not be made, only the large version ? quite incomprehensable. however worst thing was getting sick later that evening with all the symptoms of food poisoning.not recommended"
"first of all, food was great. service took a while but didn’t affect the mood too much. would’ve given a 5 purely for the pizza! perfect mix of mushroom and spinach proper got my taste buds going. this good feeling was rapidly destroyed when we went to pay and encountered mutton chops(man behind the till). if you’re not familiar with the term then google it. he was very rude. laughed at me because i’m english. stared at me for quite some time without saying a word. mutton chops, if you’re reading this then you really need to sort out your attitud "
"we waited patiently for at least 20 minutes in front of the counter but were totally ignored by the staff walking back and forth numerous times. no hellos, how many people do you have etc. nothing. not even eye contact was made with us. they then inexplicably proceeded to serve people who arrived later than us. needless to say that we left without eating as the arrogant service shown by the staff shows that this restaurant is not worth our time and money."
"not quite sure if they have a shortage of menu cards, but when we asked for one, we were told to ask the people at another table for one!! the restaurant was almost full inside and very hot and smelt very fishy, so outside it was, luckily it warmed up and it was pleasant to sit there.when we finally got hold of a menu, and ordered, the food was good. my husband had lasagne, my friend, scampi in garlic butter, and mine was a delicious goat cheese salad. the food was very good, the service a bit less, but maybe they just had too much work. we intended staying for dessert, and once again asked for a menu, as there were none around, but that did seem to be a problem, so when no menu arrived, we decided just to get the bill instead and left."
"we were looking precisely for a good italian resto in sluis and mineral had best marks on tripadvisor. it looked pretty good at the beginning and was full of people (most ordering pizza). in fact, we got self made sparkling water (6,5 euro/bottle.. ); tomato soup was a disaster (too hot, with too much salt and huge pieces of tomatoes - obviously from cane); pasta was ok (i would give 6 points from 10); but service made it all.. young lady who served us was tired and definitely not interested in tips, she simply picked the order, delivered food without any word, ignored coffee and bill (though she confirmed the order, we never received our espresso and i had to go to the bar to pay dinner myself). nothing to be added, we will not come back. "
first vist to sluis for me for 20 years. never bothered to go back as it was just very small with lace and porn sho 
"ordered “kip pikant” at the office we noticed that the chicken was smelling strange (sour)... we returned to the shop and complained. no real excuse was given, only some other sandwiches were given in return "
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of €17,-. fries cost €6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
i had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at the photos on the websit 
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"a family italian restaurant, not so bad. food was ok, but the place is really oldated. prices are reasonable"
"ok. pizza is sick and soggy and very salty. parmigiana was very disappointed , aubergine was no fried, like a water🙈 no fresh herbs, without fresh basilicum it is not a real deal.. most of the dinner went to the garbage.. we had a bad tummy in a half hour.. shame… not anymore "
"we had dinner with friends. i found this to be a nice place, but i found the food to be average. service was good, the limoncello was not as it should (it was made with vodka) and the feeling in the dinning area is that you are in an old restaurant needing a rebuilt to give it a fresh look. you will not be disappointed if you eat there, but you wont be excited either."
"bad service, terrible pizza, expensive .  pizza dough was either burnt or soggy. the air spray was so overwhelming that even the water tasted of it. very expensive for very very bad pizza and terrible service."
"first visit to this restaurant and a little bit disappointed despite the fact that the waitresses were nice. our entree/amuse was forgotten (!); you dont aks for it, though. the service was slow. the terderloin, i ordered was indeed from the grill but, in the middle red and absolutely not medium cooked. i mentioned it, but it was too late to be returned to the chef (which i understood). as a compensation i was offered a free drink, which was nice though. my partner had the tagliatelli with sea fruits. that was nice!."
opening hours not accurate. it states this restaurant is open to 21:45. we arrived around 20:40 and they said they were closed. very disappointing but on the positive side we then stumbled across groucho’s which was amazing and serves food till late! we arrived well after 21:00 and made very welcome by all staff. we’ll be back!
"this is a beautiful place to see, the architecture, the walk to the orangerie. and we had a great time at the wedding too."
"food is great, service inexperienced but friendly. problem was that is took way too long before food was serv "
"to be fair, we ended up in this restaurant on the worst night possible, carnival with the local party tent right next door. the restaurant was filled with drunk customers all dressed up for carniva "
"just another fast food place with forgettable food.not much good to say about it, limited drinks selection."
"the food although pricey was good. the drinks , to expencive.  at least offer an affordable choice.  because no carbohydrate side dish  we left hungry"
"i ordered the lasagna with a yoghurt and granola dessert along with a small latte. the lady at the till decided to charge me an extra 20 cents for a syrup in my coffee which i never asked for. the dining area was disgustingly filthy with dirty tables, uncleared finished meals and overflowing bins. dear me mr oliver. what have you put your name on here! i wanted to eat here instead of just going to mcdonalds all the time. next time ill stick to maccy ds!!"
"schiphol is lacking in proper food, just overpriced bread rolls with cheap filling. i decided to give this place a chance. the lasagne was cold, lacking in taste, and substance, just creamy mush. the tomato soup was far too overspiced, and im saying that as someone that enjoys spice. the cappuccino is effectively warm milk without any coffee taste, same as everywhere else in this airport. the price is extortionate. dont bother. in euros soup €5.50, lasagne €12.25. bottle of water €5, cappuccino €5. o yeah and paper plates and cutlery. "
"disgusting and chaotic. the simple order of sandwich and coffee was incorrectly delivered, it too ages to pay even though there was no queue, and the food was terrible. never again, a complete waste of money. jamie, get this place fixed or take your name off the door."
jamie oliver should be ashamed to have his name associated with this restaurant. the quality of the food is very poor
"food was cold, although the staff were ok. wished i’d gone to mcdonalds least it might have been hot food."
"shocking set up, incredibly slow service and rude sullen staff, who don’t seem to know how to make coffee. if you want hot food - good luck. queue for your food then queue for your drink and to pay. by the time you’ve got to the till your meal will be cold. macdonalds is probably nicer"
horrible. don’t ever come here absolutely shocking! food was horrible and the prices were appalling. wish i read the reviews first. you might as well go and get a mcdonald’s over this because it was just horrible. avoid this place at all cost.
honestly a terrible experience almost from start to fini 
"it says full breakfast... not sure what style? apparently its meant to feel familiar, but i paid the best part of £20 for watery dry beans, a solid sasauge and for some reason, there are new potatoes on my plate. spoons breakfast is better than jamie olivers by a country mile. yuck."
"avoid at all costs, food uneatable. didn’t touch it and staff demanded i paid for food that was shocking. so called woman chef was rude, threw the food at me and told me i didn’t pay when u did pay a shocking €30 for something we didn’t eat. this place needs a reality check as it’s customer service is shocking. don’t waste your money and go to mcdonald’s. very rubbish end to a good trip"
this restaurant was appalling. when i complained the staff laughed in my face. don’t go here as you definitely chance feeling sick afterwards as i did
"awful, awful food, slow service and hugely expensive. avoid. the vegetarian breakfast had some kind of clear sauce on it so the whole thing was swimming. actually made my daughter wretch. the mean one my other daughter had was not better - she said it was the worst sausage she had ever had. no porridge. dry bacon butty. jamies face smiling and saying he had good food for us, we wanted to be set up for the flight and ended up hungry and ripped off."
shocking service staff aloof at the tills and the food was practically inedible. it sounded great on menu but it’s not when it comes to your paper box. 4.15 for a soft drink bottle at least 50% more expensive than in the other already price inflated stores. they capitalise on their position being the first restaurant through the gate and clearly don’t feel the need to provide a service or product that justifies the price.
"do not eat here! there are many other places in schipol airport that will provide you with a decent meal. you will not get one here we ordered the veggie breakfast and they were missing ingredients from the breakfast such as the potatoes, it was luke warm and you are served in what i can only describe as cardboard dogbowl. and the bill was €35 for food that i can only describe as slop in a bowl! "
"shockingly overpriced, poor service and tables not clean. ordered the woodman’s sandwich, which was missing ingredients."
"waited ages to be served with food, as soon as i walked away a taller male was served, took my food to pay and get a drink, 3 people there but only 1 till on 2 iced coffees only 1 had ice, by the time i got to my table the food was cold, surprised at the 2* rating."
"absolutely disgusting here. lots of staff doing nothing while all tables are filthy, broken glass and generally disgusting. we even saw a mouse running around!!!"
so bad it’s laughable - except then you realise how much you paid for inedible food.  wish i had read the reviews first - they are all accurate.  this place needs to be closed
jamie. seriously.  16.95 euros for a tiny portion of cold gnocchi and a bottle of water. and you are putting your name to this. i’d be embarrassed
overpriced and not very efficient for a location that demands quick service.   slack about cleaning tables.
"had nicoise salad and a piece of pizza- both completely inedible. pizza a dry and stale. lettuce in salad was brown and slimy. took them both back up to the counter. the server was very unhelpful and said they couldn’t do anything. i asked for a refund and they questioned the fact that i had had a bite out of the pizza. i explained ‘yes that’s how i knew it was stale and dry!’ the server begrudgingly refunded my money, no apology at all. i have never left a negative review before and i never take food back unless completely inedible. can’t believe jamie oliver puts his name to this! "
"over priced, poor food and shocking services. 22.55 for a small breakfast coffee and water. the so called chef weighed out my spoon of egg. my advice stay clear and there’s better places to eat in the airport. what a complete rip-off jamie. you should be ashamed of yourself"
"total slop masquerading is an italian pasta dish.  no flavour, over cooked and essentially cold.  total brand distraction for mr oliver."
"everything about this place is awful, queued for 30 mins to find how dry and unappetising the hot breakfast was. opted for a sausage sandwich, e7.50, it was 1 sausage sliced into 3, in a completely dry bun, asked for butter or sauce and the staff said they had none at all and offered me jam. queued another 10 mins to pay so the sandwich was cold by the time i sat down. avoid at all costs. cannot believe this is trading."
"a few slices of dried up pizza alongside some dried up pasta was all they had. nothing else, no lasagna, not even any sparkling water. jamie should be ashamed."
"absolutely dreadful food! dry, bearly toasted cheese and ham toastie that cost e5 plus …. best of a bad choice … sadly, avoid !  however … highly recommend starbucks near gate h , fabulous sandwiches and cheaper  🙌"
"terrible in all respects. dirty table and floor. ridiculous queueing system meant that on getting to the front of the long line i was told that i had to order hot food a different counter, so that by the time i had queued again and gone back to the till the food was cold. breakfast “sandwich” was disgusting and the coffee tasted like dish water."
would not come back - family of 3 was 40 euros for cold food - not the quality expected at all :( still starving 🥹 first bad meal we have had in holland
really unpleasant breakfast - trying to be high end and charging high end prices but done terribly. rock hard sausage with cubes of scrambled egg with some crusty rosemary thrown on in an attempt to justify the price.
awful breakfast in a bowl. long wait to pay by which time poor quality food was cold.  dont have  high expectations for airport food but for 45 euro expect it to be edible. had a better breakfast out a tin
"absolutely disappointing. we went there as we both like jamie‘s dishes. but what you get there is a bad joke. pasta that tastes like nothing, pizza that is only oily. lots of stuff not on stock, employees highly unmotivated. better go downstairs to the „bread“ bar, here the food looked fresh and tasted as expected. "
we sewed the name and went i 
"paid €40 for food served in a cardboard bowl a teaspoon of scrambled egg, a sausage, rock hard bacon (ordered toast but didnt receive it) it was cold and looked awful. asked for the manager who couldnt be found so requested a refund. unbeknownst to me the table next to mine was also requesting a refund. our details were taken and i am still waiting 2 weeks later. cannot get hold of anyone to speak to and airport cannot help 🤷🏼‍ "
"the sausages are lovely but food so expensive charged for every item such as butter , sauces…. staff very slow and ignored us while they chatted among themselves"
"had a meal before flight home, medium bowl of mushroom pasta was bland, mushy and cost 8 euros, coke 5 euros, have had tastier pot noodles but was hungry so ate it, come on jamie, thought you were trying to get people to save money on food ! not this time"
prettt poor venue. staff not clearing table and left rubbish everywhere. half the food unavailable or looking like it had seen better days.
"my wife is a fan of jamie oliver and we was very excited to eat there. but the food was terrible without flavor. we order an aubergine parmigiano. the presentation was bad, but even worse the flavor. we also order a sandwich that was so simple. it was a very disappointing experience."
"only one member of staff to serve a queue of over twenty people. i joined with only four people ahead of me and that took twenty minutes. many people joined after. many people complaining of cold food as you have to collect your food first, then wait in a queue to pay. glad i only had coffee. once seated it was easy to see the tables had not been cleaned for hours and bins were overflowing. disgusting. wish i’d gone to starbucks. will never go to a jamie oliver again."
"terrible food quality. had the pasta bolognaise m, no flavour at all. taste like basic brand pasta sauce.  jamie oliver you should be ashamed to put your name to this place, but wealth and greed are the drives you more."
"terrible.  worse food ever.  no favour, tepid and soggy.  whole restaurant filthy with no one to clear tables.  would really avoid this restaurant at all cost."
has to be the wor 
"none of the tables were cleaned or cleared. customers had to clear tables themselves. the food is so basic, pasta (very plane) 2 choices of overpriced pizza, very tiny basic salads. bad coffee. i didn’t have a beer but they at least looked ok. there isn’t much choice of food in the airport but honestly mcdonalds would be better and 1/2 the price so just go there. jamie take your name off this shambles of a place or improve it!"
"absolute rip off for what it is, like microwaved pasta actually shop bought ones are nicer got lasagne just sheets of pasta no mince"
"can’t believe jamie oliver put his name to this restaurant. complete waste of money. really basic food, served badly."
"you would hope to get a decent feed when jamie oliver puts his name and face on a food outlet. i realise im in an airport, past security but still. "
"bad tempered staff, the worst, soggy bolognese pasta with no flavor at all! what does the name jamie oliver stand for? for the extortionate prices? money wasted, unfortunately :(("
mushroom pasta inedible- smelled and tasted like burnt garlic and cold by the time you have paid. same some years ago when it first opened but i had hoped for improvement- pity.
jamie oliver should be embarrassed having his name above the door. i had the mushroom pasta. no taste and the sauce was like water. also the pasta was over cooked. i expected so much more. what a let down jamie.
i had the misfortune to have a jamie’s deli breakfast yesterday morning at shiphol airpo 
"no one at the counter when i arrived, when called, refused to come to help me & a colleague came in his place. the ham & cheese toastie wasn’t great & the iced coffee was pretty dire. at 20 euro for those +a muffin & cappuccino, we were less than impressed"
"overpriced, pasta salad with no flavour. couldn’t even provide me with a wine glass for my overpriced wine. no staff cleaning tables. was forced to eat here as arrived in airport after 6 pm and unfortunately was the only option."
"at 17:30 they’d run out of some food. no trays, filthy tables, lacklustre staff apart from one kind soul who offered me her tray from behind the ba "
don’t waste your money here £3 for a measly 50gram of salad  we spent 24 euro on a coffee and two snacks  absolute joke jamie sort it out please!!!!!!!
"i visited jamie’s deli on sun 28th aug at 19-07 the queues were average i ordered pasta with mushrooms and a piece of margarita pizza the pasta came out of a new;y prepared dish in which i thought would be piping hot it wasn’t after queuing for almost ten minuets for a drink and to pay when i got to my table it was only aired there was only two staff on the counter taking payments serving coffee and drinks which was not enough,i think jamie oliver should visit his deli in disguise to sample the excuse for food and service i paid euros 29.70 with a drink i think if jamie oliver sees this review he should refund my money."
"this place is a disgraceful rip off, with shocking quality food & non-existent customer service. the breakfast €14.95 was all lumped into a bowl and did not include toast or tea/coffee/juice. they provided 4 slices of toast and charged us €16 extra - they would not provide more that 4 small butter servings. a small bottle of water was €5.10 & we were treated like criminals because they claimed we didn’t pay for 3 slices of toast. it’s disgraceful & embarrassing for jamie oliver to put his name to this. do not support this restaurant."
this was really poor. the food was really low quality and the aubergines were like eating rubber. really disappointing.
"alas the porridge, usually a safe bet for vegans, has cow’s milk in it. they offered to serve me the vegetarian breakfast without the eat but i was not in the mood for a heavy full english style breakfast. they do have non-dairy milks for tea and coffee."
"it’s the first thing you see when you enter the departure hall at schiphol. my advice: walk past  it and look for something good. it was quite disgusting. dirty trays, bad food, not very friendly. waste of money."
"€8 for one small piece of pizza that tastes like it has been sat out for an hour. service is terrible, staff look at you like you are inconveniencing them. avoid!"
"the gluten free options were very few and what was available was just poor, the staff although helpful didnt seem to know what was available. so i had to try to work it out for myself and have another salad lol i think jamie needs to have a look at this outlet and get a grip of things. the others in our group were only slightly less disappointed than i was."
food was terrible overpriced and service hopeless.  should have gone to mcdonalds next door.  trading on jamie’s name - jamie should disown this place.
jamie’s deli is directly opposite the exit from security. we arrived there at 1pm. lunchtime 
don’t waste your time or your money. the food is awful (like jamie oliver) and you have to be lucky to get a choice without having to wait 30 minutes.
a complete nightmare. by the time you have waited to pay your food it is cold. if you want to go back for a drink you have to wait another 30 mins.
"a total waste of my and my partners time. waited half an hour, with only one staff member on the tills doing the coffee and taking orders which was at 6 am which was the morning rush in the airpo "
"menus at entrance does not depict what they actually have. slowest line ever. 4 people behind the counter but apparently only one taking orders, taking money and making the coffee!!! very inefficient. we through out the iced coffee, the ham and cheese baguette had a pungent translucent onion we scrapped off .. other than that it was fine"
"visited several times recently, service is terrible, unhelpful staff and illogical queuing system, cold overpriced food by the time you actually pay for it. the place is beyond dirty, appears to not be cleaned throughout the day."
"im very disappointed with the whole experience at jamie oliver at schiphols airport. it has only the name. cold coffee, hard aubergine with wood cutlery which was impossible to cu "
avoid at all costs. dirty tables everywhere and staff chatting behind the corner. queried why my large coffee only filled 2/3rds of the cup and was told very rudely that it wasnt their problem. they then stood laughing. very unpleasant experience.
"awful. slow service, rude staff and messy, dirty trays and tables. avoid at all costs and someone please tell jamie to quit racking in the cash and spend more attention insuring anything with your name to it is up to standard"
"tables not cleared.  crumbs everywhere.  poor choice of food and what there was was poorly served.   people hogging tables; but not eating  jamie,jamie.  is this really what you envisioned…?"
"poor choice of food and honestly the pizza was terrible, very hard crust (probably old) and not so tasty. i would have expected more from a jamie franchise. would not recommend it"
"just terrible in every way. horri le food, miserable choice, inept staff, dirty. hard to fathom why this version of jamies franchises didnt also go bust, other than the absolute lack of choice in such a big airport (mcdonalds the only other at 1930 on a weekday...)"
"dirty, expensive and long waiting for a simple coffee. nobody comes around to check or clean the tables."
"o my goodness, that was the slowest service ever, 8 people working but you got feeling like is only 1 there, no one do anything. jamie for f..k sake its"
"oh dear . what a shocking disappointment- by the time the food on the paper plate was placed in front of me - it was luke warm at best. i seriously expected better than this. it was a toss up between them and their neighbours mcd- i thought that i would get better quality at jamie’s. sadly, i was so wro "
"only one thing actually offered on the menu and it was a gross, sloppy pasta. had to queue unnecessarily for over 15 mins which made the food cold. also was charged €5 for a bottle of water and the staff were rude. awful."
"overpriced, poor food selection, extremely dirty, uninterested slow staff and not at all tasting. i am no fan of mcdonald’s but in this case you should go for this instead which is right across."
"waited in queue for atleast 40 minutes, there were only four staff working, one making sandwiches, one cooking, one at payout and the fourth mostly just stood around doing nothing - time to time plating some foo "
"schipol is not great for dining at the best of times, but this is exceptionally bad. utter chaos, tables rarely cleared, uninterested staff, and terribly over priced. 11 euros for soggy, chewey pasta, 9 euros for some generic burnt carbohydrate (possibly pizza). a fitting end of the line to jamies restaurant empire. avoid at all costs"
"simply terrible by jamie oliver is what it should be called. the food for start is very over priced, if you manage to get over that fact the food is served while you are in the queue but the you have to wait while they make peoples coffees before you can pay and by that time our breakfast was now cold. they should have a designated pick up are for coffee/tea so they queue can keep moving. however the food is of a very poor standard. the sausage with the breakfast was extremely dry, why jamie oliver would want to put his name to this i do not know. go to mcdonald’s or something would even be a better choice than this."
skip th 
well what can i say..i had the lasagne...well it was left as it was dry and no meat and all pasta..no taste to it what so eve 
"sadly a big lie. promises all good stuff and no nasties but the hot breakfast was nasty and bad. scrambled egg looks like porridge and tastes nasty as does the sausage. to salty. the logistics also need work. prices are high what is no surprise, especially at an airpor "
for some reason loads of places were shut in schiphol when were travelling back so there wasnt much choice other than this or mcdonald 
chose this over mcdonalds (only other choice). pasta was cold & virtually inedible. salad was 2 spoonfuls & not great. pizza was even worse. total waste of money. beer was lovely & cold & only good thing about the experience! otherwise wouldnt even give it one star.
"there seemed to be only a choice of mcdonalds or here on the day so we opted for this thniking the food would be better. how wrong could we be? two dreadful, tastelesss small plates of mushroom pasta and a slice of horrible, burnt pizza. two tiny (200ml) orange juices, 11 euros for those. bottle of water at 4.95 euros. total just under 50 euros for the worst meal i think i have ever had when travelling. very cynical not to put prices on the drinks and then to overcharge so ruthlessly."
-1. absolutely disgusting only us in queue waited 15 minutes to order breakfast then 15 minutes to pay by this time good was stone cold. we requested a replacement meal. food was disgusting and just slapped on cardboard plate. staff so slow and more interested in eating own breakfast. masks being worn on chin not covering mouth or nose. tables dirty.
truly disgraceful portions and price. cannot believe that jamie oliver would condone this if he knew. image of double portion of salad. (very tasty though)
a portion of pasta salad was literally two pieces of greasy penne and an olive and two bits of tomato. staff unfriendly and its so overpriced for the portions. cant believe jamie oliver put his name to this. i came here because i thought it would be tasty and well prepared. so disappointing. do not eat here.
"ok, so the pandemic has meant the travel industry has taken a huge hit with low traffic/travellers but this restaurant was embarrassing! it was six oclock in the evening & the selection of food was non-existent or dried up! the only food for a gluten free diet was a dried up salad, the lasagne my husband ate in desperation looked like it had been out since 10.00am. truly awful! the floor & tables were grubby & the staff half asleep. you have to wonder whether jamie oliver would eat there!"
slow service. sleepy atmosphere. nothing to as jamies says kick-start your morning. poor food and quite pricey. i asked few times for a sandwich that takes 30sec to make. avoid.
departure area 3. poor cappuccino and sickly brownie for more than 8 euros. only place open for coffee so  not much choice. slap your name on any crap. i seem to remember eating here a couple of years ago and it was lousy then too.
"we had a morning flight so chose to eat at the airport. i ordered a bacon bap but unfortunately after eating a mouthful, i discovered it had onions in it! i have a reaction to onions which makes my body swell and i get intense stomach ache. the menu did not say the item contained onions!"
"i ordered a pizza,and got piec of dried bread.i could hardly cut the pizza with the plastic fork.this place was a huge disappointment."
"it was overpriced like all the other food on airports. the veggie breakfast bowl i got was okay, but the bacon sandwiches were disappointing: a bun with 2 strips of bacon and some sautéed onions. they also have smoothies which they make to order and pre-made baguettes with ham&cheese, mozzarella, chicken, etc. not worth it to come by here!"
i wish id read some of the reviews beforehand. the restaurant itself looks ok but thats as far as it goe 
"fly here a lot thought i’d try some where new. tried a slice of pizza, very little cheese tomato sauce and pepperoni for 8 euro what a joke another rip off place!!  i would not put my name to this place won’t be coming back!!!"
insane prices worst quality. just skip this please if you can. the owner of this place is only there to make you lose money without doing anything
expensive spot in the airport for some last minute food.. nothing special altho it gives the look of a more upmarket establishment
"made the mistake of reading the reviews after ordering! this was the most expensive meal we had in amsterdam and by far the worst. €40 for 2 breakfasts including a €5 bottle of water - i realise food at airports is generally more expensive but i do not see how this is justified. dirty tables because staff are so busy serving customers, other reviews mentioned rude staff but i must say we did not encounter this. food was not bad, but i believe you should get what you pay for and this was not even close to a €40 meal."
"this is easily the absolute worst place i have ever eaten. the tables had lively lamps on them, but were caked in dust. i mean just absolutely covered. as if someone had just found them in their grandparents basements after 50 years being in there. wipe the things. thats all i ask. and they are on the table that you eat at, thats whats so ba "
lasagne good but small porti 
"can i give no stars? never had to before. looks like prison food, £30 for the privilege. waited 25 mins for slop. hideous. walk on by. how does jo put his name to this crap!!! didn’t even get all items!! probably a blessing."
"terrible place! poor service, moody and careless staff borderline with rudeness. the place stop serving breakfast at 10:30 am. a total waste of a prime space."
"i came here for a pasta salad, which was the cheapest item on the menu. tasty enough and plenty of seating area. experience was slightly ruined when i saw a mouse scurrying under one of the tables...bit worrying at an airport?"
£12-95 absolutely awful never again chilli beans at the bottom awful place staff don’t care what they serve you
after visiting this establishment in march we didnt have a great experience as our food was undercooke 
sausage sandwich and coffee coming to €15 ...sandwich was mediocre. most staff barely spoke english and they did not ha e basic condiments - ketchup / brown sauce. also not one member of staff could advise where the napkins were. would not go here again!
"hardly any hot food, very poor pitza, overpriced, never again. come on jamie get your act together ...."
"we were a party of 6 travellers and decided to try that old conman jamie oliver. everyone of us agreed that mcdonalds is the way to go. we all paid €12.95 for a full breakfast. no drink included, so another €3 for a tea or coffee. no value for money here. the eggs were tasteless, potatoes hard, bacon not too bad, tomatoes were over done and bland, they had no mushrooms, so offered me peppers. laughable, an english breakfast ruined for the sake of olivers art. i can imagine his airport delis will be following shortly. 6 customers that wont be visiting again."
there wasn’t a big range of food when i got here. i went for lasagne with salad and potatoes although i just got a little portion of rocket. the food was tasty and i got the apple pie with cream. they only did heineken so got a red wine. overall it was more than 24 euros with plastic cutlery and food in cardboard boxes. i expected more for what i paid.
"to bridge the time of 10 hours at schiphol we (3 couples) decided to eat at jamies dinner. although the taste of pasta was pretty good, it was a huge disappointment. served in a cardboard box, lukewarm and half full, the price of 8 euros is way too much money. the seats were not clean and napkin not available. too bad for a case that bears the name of jamie. eaten better at other jamie locations for a more reasonable price than here. the price is absolutely disproportionate for what and the quantity you get served. unfortunately"

"hard breakfast on outbound trip and lunch on the way back, both times the food was good although a little expensive"
"the selection of food is not as good as the menu suggests, much of it looks as if it has been out for a long time, the service is slow. my salad was adequate but my sparkling water was not chilled. there will not be a repeat visit. jamie oliver should not put his name to such mediocrity. "
left over nasty foul pizza and horrible salad for 33 euros people miserable and resent customers this place should be closed down by the health department
sad i can’t give this place negative reviews. not only is the food extremely overpriced (even by airport standards) but they don’t allow you to make simple changes (i couldn’t even get a side of bacon and my friend couldn’t add cheese to her bacon toastie). when i got to the counter they said i couldn’t pay with my card even though all my friends did and they all had visas just like i did. i only had dollars and somehow my already outrageous total of 18 euros went up to 28 us dollars (?!?!?!!). to top it all off my croissant was burnt. bottom line-don’t let your hunger blind you as this is the first cafe you see when passing security. keep moving there’s loads better (even mcdonald’s).
food was mediocre the only thing worth getting is their espresso and chocolate croissant. this place is extremely overpriced. try to avoid it if you can.
we stopped here for food before catching a ryanair flight to dublin. coffee was good. smoothie was good. sandwiches were goo 
"arrived @ schipol with time & wanted breakfast. too bad i didn’t check the reviews. full english breakfast: streaky bacon good, cumberland sausage good, roasted tomato very good, portobello mushroom (full half) also very good. but then! beans quite tasty (not the usual mushy beans), before the spiciness kicked in — *very* spicy, very un-english. similarly, the scrambled eggs. who makes scrambled eggs spicy!? if you like spicy, the food was quite good. my palate won’t be back, however."
at the airport we didnt want burgers and wanted to sit at a table to eat. jamies looked ok and prices not b 
when we saw jamie’s deli at the airport we were delighted having always wanted to try one out. what a major disappointment from start to finish. miserable staff and despite it being empty no-one rushed to serve us and we were stood waiting for sometime. numerous staff walked past us but none seemed bothered we were stood waiting. eventually the “worlds most miserable young girl” came and served us and told me to go and pay at the checkout then come back. she took forever to scoop the pulled pork into the baps!! had i not have paid already i would have walked out at this poin 
"would have walked away having looked at the 3 horrendous dried up school canteen hot offerings and the all bread no filling sandwiches, but my colleague was starving, wanted a seat, and it was the quietist eating place in the airport........it is obvious w "
"glad something was open early.  found there were quite a few choices for breakfast.  i loved the array of pitchers full of flavored waters.  service was quick and polite, they were constantly cleaning counters and tables.  got a latte to go also."
"it was an easy choice, jamies deli, if you dont want fat fast food or a sloppy sandwi "
very tasty but i was quite stunned to receive less than half a single aubergine as an €8 serving of aubergine parmigiana. and serving it in a small diameter but deep cardboard bowl with plastic cutlery is a joke. disappointing.
"our plane had a delay over 6,5 hou "
"came here for some quick food before our flight and we’re crazy shocked at the prices and poor choice. the vegetarian hot option was ‘aubergine parmigiana’ which was not even half an aubergine with some tomato sauce and cheese and they wanted €8!? if you wanted potatoes with it that was an extra €4, a bottle of water is also about €4. i complained to the server who just shrugged so we headed over to mcdonald’s, not my first choice but you can at least get a good veggie chicken burger meal for less than €12. save you’re money and go elsewhere!"
where do i sta 
"over-seasoned to hell, served in a box, terrible service - would have expected a lot more from jamies having previously eaten at his restaurants. wish id have gone to mcdonalds.. at least theres a consistent standard which there doesnt seem to be at jamies."
"my wife and i had a quick meal at lunch time at jamies deli fast-food restaurant in the food-court located at schiphol international airport on 12th may 2019. the restaurant is on the first floor and was not too crowded. there was ample seating. we collected a tray and served ourselves before making the payment at the service counter. it was a quick meal at a reasonable price, but with plastic plates, cups and cutlery. no personalized service to speak of!"
quick service but motorway cafe standard food- should pizza be chewey? 
"celebrity chef, airport restaurant? after walking through the entire airport looking for a place to eat we settled on jamies deli, it had a good name attached to it and the food looked good. the process to actually order the food was a nightmare and took forever even though there was only 5 or 6 people in front of me. i did not understand while it was taking so as there was plenty of people behind the counter to make this work efficiently but maybe they were unsure how to do that or maybe some of them were just lazy? i ordered the full monty and my girlfriend got a cheese toasty, the full monty was delicious with roasted portabella, cumberland sausage, rashers, grilled onion all served on brioche. the toasty and fresh squeezed juice were good as well. just need to figure out that service piece now. review would have been excellent if based on the food alone, and yes of course its a little pricey, its in the airport!"
"pepperoni pizza was a square of thick dough, with 3 slices of sausage and a scraping of tomato base. i had aubergine bake and it was tasteless. a ‘portion’ of herbed potato at €4.50 could not be called a serving....easy to count how many were in the carton. go to mcdonald’s instead :-("
"i have been to jamie oliver’s restaurant at schiphol airport three times now. the first two visits were disappointing (eg the bircher müsli tastes as if someone added more cinnamon than oats, staff opened the restaurant 40 minutes later than the official opening time etc.). my visit yesterday was disastrous. i got severe food poisoning from the superfood wrap. there must be also some issues in terms of hygiene in the kitchen. it’s a shame as i like jamie oliver’s cook shows but this place is far from his cooking on tv."
"soggy, unappetising veggie breakfast served in a disposable pot with single use cutlery. really disappointing and not the quality of food or dining experience i’ve come to expect from jamie’s. give it a miss."
"i had.  atrocious thin watery lukewarm porridge with a meagre plastic pot of honey very bland tasteless cappuccino, also lukewarm. sausage sandwich with fried/caramelised onions was average at best.."
"wanted the full & veggie breakfast. waited in line like forever only to be told there were no eggs left but server went on to serve the lady after me, stating eggs were only enough for one. she couldve at least told me she had only enough for one. ended up ordering a sandwich but turned out to be the most pathetic ever. do not come here! coffee is bad too. "
"food is jamies style, a healthy approach to the comfort british food you crave while travelli "
i decided to treat the family to something a little nicer at the airport and was drawn in by the great design of the restaurant and name associated with quality foo 
"the food is excellent, i had the full monty roll with bacon and cumberland sausage and a bircher muesli and coffee. as i waited for my order to be made which seemed to take longer than one would have thought i saw that they only had one person serving on the tills and doing coffee with a long queu in spite of lots of other staff around. i like my food as jamie intended, which in this case hot. i decided to say to the serving staff that i would eat and pay after otherwise my food would be cold. they were fine about this but it meant i could not get any coffee or ketchup which is 60cents per sachet (really jamie!!! "
it is in a great location eg its the first eatery you see when clearing security!! 
we tried jamies before our flight to stansted. i thought jamie olivers name is a good choice as i had good experience before at gordon ramsays eat out at heathr 
"absolutely dreadful! the pulled pork was lukewarm and bland. the muesli pot was runny and far inferior to pret or itsu. staff were morose. staggered jamie would put his name to this place!, please sort it out!,"
"rubbish, had a penne pasta dish, served in a cardboard box, 60 percent full, tasted like a microwave meal from iceland, how jamie oliver can put his name on this food shows how completely out of touch from the image he portrays. i won’t ever by another book or watch your shows ever again! shame on you jamie!!!!!"
"never again, the server behind the counter actually weighed the portion, adding the 3 hour old slop into a cardboard container, then taking some out and then adding some more till he hit the prescribed weight, he then repeated this for the baby potatoes adding and removing in a similar fashion.swapping our larger for smaller potato "
"dreadfully presented, tired salads, overly sweet pulled pork, food that has been sat being kept warm for hours, dirty wine glass, piece of plastic in the salad, plastic cutlery, worst airport food in a long tim "
service dreadful. and rip off. ladies behind counter won’t answer my request for napkins. second request i’m told they are out of napkins (in a deli!) and i’m offered a tiny peace of indefinite cleaning/toilet paper in replacement. lunch is ruined for good now. thx
had pasta. wish i had not.  simply dreadful.   dirty floors dirty tables and vile awful disgusting food and a total rip off.   jamie you put your name to it.  you should be ashamed.
where to start ...over €8 for a bowl (tiny tiny portion) of penne bolognese ...the additional €3.50 for a rocket and parmesan salad - 7 rocket leaves dropped on top of the penne without a hint of parmesan ...the long que while your tiny expensive food goes cold ...the difficulty of managing your tray and hand luggage ...the clearly unhappy st

"expensive, very poor service, unhelpful staff, poor food waste of money disappointing end to a fantastic wkend"
"i ordered the pulled pork and it felt like drinking syrup. so sweet. my coffee took nearly 10 minutes because the cashier was chatting, then she forgot my order, then she forgot i had paid, then she forgot i had asked for soy milk. had i not been so hungry and afraid of throwing food i would have poured everything down the drain."
"i was surprised with how simple the restaurant looks like. when my husband said jamie, i was like as in jamie oliver? when we checked the food on display, we were hesitant as there was nothing special on offer it’s just like a fast food restaurant. food taste good, who can go wrong with pizza and pasta? we also had pulled pork comes with little coleslaw without bread. "
"what a dump!! not what i was expecting at all! it’s like a school canteen but least they get proper knives and forks! so the menu reads ok but then u realise it’s just someone plonking some pasta from a massive bowl in a cardboard tub wow tasted ok but very little quantity there. the new potatoes that cost €4 for 13 small potatoes wow, again tasted ok but £13 for these two items! the place was filthy, 85% of tables were dirty and empty and i had to clear my own table twice!! never again i’d rather spend less know what i’m getting an have a dirty mcdonald’s. no wonder jamie is on the decline!! shut the place "
absolutely awful considering this place acts as a high quality place to eat in the airport. two tiny bowls of average pasta and a bottle of warm pepsi cost €20!!! should have just gone to mcdonalds for half the price.
ate at this deli yesterday.  service was dreadful.  food cold.  overpriced.  dirty tables.  this is second visit and never again.
"now i know airport eateries are expensive as you are a captive audience but £12.50 for a small coffee, a small bottle of orange juice and a small bottle of still water is an insult! did consider a sandwich but quickly abandoned the idea when i saw the prices started at £6.50 and went up from there! and £3.45 for a single croissant! avoid and go elsewhere"
"staff were super friendly and lovely but unfortunately the food wasn’t worth the price you pay. you expect airport food not to be the best but as i’m veggie i ordered the safe option of the cheese and mushroom toasted sandwich it had probably less than one mushroom on and a thin slice of cheese. spent around €22 for two toasted sandwiches, a small coffee and a lipton ice tea - a sachet of ketchup is €0.60. it wasn’t the worst experience but just wish we got more for our money."
"no idea where to start. rudest staff that i have come across in a long time. stale food, in warm refrigerators. i decided just to take a drink but they only took cash. so i asked if there was a café or bar in departures instead, to which i received a shrug of the shoulders. no postitives to say at all."
came for breakfast. unbelievably small portion for 11eur. and completely cold by the time made to front of line. and bland scrambled eggs.
"sandwich was of the day before. the bread was soggy and half baked, the salad was almost black, the tomatoes slimy...in other words not to eat and paid exhiobitant prices! is that jamie’s quality food??? never again"
simply awful! don’t waste your money! they had run out of half the items before 1pm or more likely never had them. toastier was disgusting. no point adding about anything else as everything was poor
not enough staff. no apology for huge waiting time. one bloke just walking round doing nothing when he could be serving. ran out of bacon at 9.30am? terrible service. will never step foot in a jamie oliver establishment again.
"this place doesn’t even deserve 1 star. we were at the front of the queue and waited 20 minutes for a bacon sandwich?! asked for scrambled egg also and it was a huge deal like we couldn’t have any. the girl that was serving us was unbelievably rude. i have never seen such bad customer service in my life! i asked for bacon in my sandwich, i was willing to pay an extra euro or whatever but she replied and said we don’t do that. while we were ordering, a man came over as he had ordered a vegetarian breakfast which said it included beans on the menu. he came over and complained that he had already paid for it and there was no beans and the girl just said “well we don’t have any beans so how am i supposed to put them in in your breakfast” avoid at all costs!"
" we wanted to have something to eat before taking our morning flight. we stopped at jamies but was still not opened, we checked internet page it said open at 7am was already 7:3 "
"second time here, i thought the first time was bad.. "
"cups and plates everywhere, sticky floor, the waitresses chatting amongst each other, not actually doing anything. the food is awful (besides they only had 2 options at the time we were there). only the wine is worth your money."
"8m used to appalling airport food, but here they manage to make an attractive looking cheese and tomato croissant into a semi burnt offering! service slow, very slow in fact. 5he place is a tip, empty coffee cups everywhere, uncollected rubbish. avoid at all costs"
"no wonder jamie  oliver is closing his restaurants.  ate here recently and it was awful. pasta with bolognaise sauce, stodgy, overcooked congealed mess.  to add insult to injury it was also lukewarm .  would never eat there again, avoid at all cots"
are here today. food was dehydrated and the pasta was crispy from sitting under the heat lamps. portion was small for the price.
"ordered a cheese and ham toastie. afeter finding a table which had actually been cleared, found that there was no ham in the toastie, only cheese. went back to get a refund for the ham part of the toastie, which was given without too much trouble. i thought a restaurant with the jamie oliver name would be good but i won’t be back."
"absolutely disgusting calling a english breakfast ( salty new potatoes and soggy eggs and massive mushrooms) for 12€ you having a laugh most ridiculous joke i’ve heard of, no one go here , imagine jamie oliver trying to promote healthy eating then putting salt on everything lol funny one that one."
"we arrived in terminal 3 schipol for an early flight and were looking for breakfast. the website says that jamies opens at 7.00 am so we hung around a bit, at 7.05 i popped under the barrier to ask the staff busy cooking what time they would open. i had several different answers from a couple of staff members from 7.10 to 7.30 or maybe 8.00 am. needless to say we ate elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!"
first of all ive eaten in jamies restaurant in liverpool uk so i was expecting a similar kind of food quality. we ordered 2 of the ultimate cheese toastie and a piece of apple cak 
terrible service.  deli forgot about our order even though we were visibly standing 10 feet away and had reminded them.
cappuccino was boiling hot. cheese and ham sandwich turned out to be a disgusting sweet onion paste with cheese. barely edible.  really slow service. bad value for money.

"we had the pulled pork, plus beetroot quinoa salad both very tasty, ordered a side portion of new potatoes. the pulled pork had great fresh flavour, it was moist and the potatoes were infused in olive oil, garlic and rosemary. very satisfied....confused about the bad reviews. the man serving the food was very friendly and smiley."

"let’s get the bad bit out of the way first , paid €4.65 for 19 grapes. please jamie don’t ever take about the importance of fresh food every day at that price. oh and two of the were rotten . have eaten here before service is slow and they never have the full menu of offer . when it’s only 6 mains you would think that was possi "
"the menu is simple but varied. the seating typical jamie. some dishes are better than others but the mushroom pizza was very good. one comment by several patrons was about the amount of plastic being used, which surprises me of jamie. the lady in front of us asked not to cover the carton bowl with a plastic cover as she was having her meal in the restaurant. the answer was “sorry it is policy and i cannot serve the food without the cover”. jamie should know better. "
"very bad costumer service. the staff seems very unhappy and unfriendly. no respond to “hello”, no thank you. when we asked if we can pay in pounds the respond was yes however when we asked if we could have the change back in pounds as well the respond was sarcastic: i’m not a bank! clearly there is a better way to respond to a costumer who pays €3.50 for a baby portion of salad! we would not be coming back ; not an experience we would expect from jamie’s deli."
"a typical jamie experience, relying on the emperors new clothes syndrome to indicate that nothing you do or put your name to can be awful. it can and it is! visited before our return flight to london, should have know better after a previous terrible experience at jamies italian in kingst "
hot food (overpriced) was cold by the time the payment queue cleared. everything that an airport café should not be.
"jamie, close this branch down for the sake of your international name. there was a huge queue while we watched a lady neatly tidy up some bottles of overpriced water while there was only one staff member at the till. i asked if she’d kindly serve us and she refused saying that she has to straighten the water bottles. she then slowly walked to the counter and served us with a stinking attitude. lots of staff around despite there being a queue, over heated food at the deli counter, really expensive product, almost €3 for a bag of popcorn!!!! eventually we were served and i got a reply of, ‘i don’t care, i’ll be gone next week anyway”. this is a busy airport, one of the busiest in the world and is making you look terrible. you’re reviews are also very poor! super disappointed and i am a big jamie fan! xx"
i visited this awful restaurant for the first time in schiphol airport in amsterdam two days ago and all i can say is its sooooooo bad! on the screen it shows you photos of all the meals which you can get and the prices. the customer in front of me oredered the pulled pork and she got quite a big amount and so i opted for the penne bolognaise as the tub it came in on the photo was full to the brim with lovely looking tasting food also. when the girl served the dish she put 2 spoons into the tub and it was so small! it cost me 7.95 euros for one tub! there was hardly any meat in it nor cheese. it was quite tastless too. i was still hungry after eating it. myself and my partner got the same dish plus a beer and it came to 21.90 euros!!! jamie you should be ashamed of yourself charging that amount for such a tiny meal!! avoid at all costs!!!
"it is a disgrace - we stopped here as it was the first venue when you come through security (clever placement). menu looks good with a decent selection of food. i ordered superfood salad and fresh pressed juice. salad had tastless beetroot and 2 soggy bits of dead broccoli in it, juice was rancid. husband ordered pasta dish - badly burnt pasta that you could chip a tooth eating and the meat was nuked and smelt awful. kids had pizza - it was flat bread with greasy cheese. bill was €50 - we left the food behind, hungy and annoyed we boarded our flight as when we walked to gate we saw so many other better places to eat - do not stop here!!"
"the food was actually ok. however, after i had joined the food queue to get my slice of hot pizza i didnt stay in that queue but instead had to join a second queue to pay and join it at the back. whoever, thought this through needs to think again. its bad enough when you go to a motorway service station and your hot breakfast is quickly chilling as you approach the till but the process i describe here is doubly bad. the pizza was actually pretty good but i was boiling with frustration made worse by the people on the till making coffees too thus further slowing things down"
"we had a nice lunch, taste was great. high proces : bottle of spa rood 0,5 liter costs 3,75 eu "
"having decided to give jamie a try i ended up going hungry. i could list a number of problems, but they were just about excusable in a very busy schiph "
"i have tried on numerous times both pizza and pasta - and sad to say i rather buy frozen ones at albert heijn or make my own - my kids dont eat them, and i must say we have been dissapointed everytime. we wont be back here again at all"
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.
"i visited a friend in assen, she booked this restaurant. its large amount for me, and plenty of bread,my friend ordered pizza it was alright, but there are too much sauce in my lasagna. service is nice and tiramisu cake is great. i er not to common whether its authentic since it relates to different perspectives. overall it was an okay experience."
"the most important step in pizza preparation is to make a soft and elastic dough. it sounds simple but its really an art. unfortunately, chefs of bella italia didnt master this craft therefore i have to rate the pizza as an average. and i am still quite kind to the "
good food but a little too commercially orientated. the restaurant was packed on a tuesday. i got seated at a table that was in the middle of the path the waiters used to get to the kitchen. there shouldn’t have been a table there. i would compare the food to a happy italy but you’ve got a couple more options and it’s a little more expensive.
"busy for a weekday. enough staff to serve all the guests, we lost count of the number of waitresses/waiters coming to our table. nice food, but both pizza and calzone were very salty. the calzone was mostly crispy crust."
"just come back from a weeks stay in assen and we had to visit bella italia twice! the first visit was just myself and my wife we both had yummy pizza ( no 46) thin crust, loads of toppings and the size of a small family car wheel! what’s not to like about that, we sat inside which was a bit of a mistake as it was very warn but all in all a nice eveni "
had pizza here and couldn’t fault the food. we ate outside on a hot day and the flies were all over. very annoying. would definitely recommend to eat inside on a hot day

"went with family and friends on a warm summers evening in august 2017. we sat outside, sharing our corner with a friendly cat  "
we went with a friend whi goes there oft 
"restaurant was busy but had plenty of staff. quick to take order but slow to deliver. waitress was wondering aimlessly with drinks on a tray , eventually caught her eye and managed to rescue wine, when meal came the lasagne was poor lot of pasta but short on filling and very bland, spag bol not much better lot of spaghetti but very little bolanaise sauce. quick to take payment for the meal but still waiting for my change - luckily not much - will not use this place again."
"food is ok but not brilliant. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. thought the pizza was too greasy. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. location good though on the market, normally quite a few people eating there due to affordability. next door is better."
visit the place on a fridayevening with my girlfriend. crowded: reservation is recommend 
we were quite a large group on 2 tables. we were put under a canopy and offered blankets or at least some were. the table i was on put the order in about 10 minutes before the other table and guess who got there meal first. yep you guest the other tabl 
its a large restautant and the tables are place very close to eachother. the choice of pizza and pasta is enormous. the portions are big. we had a starter and couldnt finish the pizza.
"ive gotten pizza here twice and i can say that these are the worst pizzas ive ever had in my entire life. frozen oven pizzas at the store are more enjoyable than this, it feels like they make the pizzas with cheese and tomato sauce then just dumb a bunch of ingredients on there reheat it and done....."
massive size pizza and thats where the meal went downhill soggy in the middle and tasteless  everything out of a tin  asked for piquant and struggled to find a chilli overpriced and poor
"im not sure what went wrong this time. this restaurant has expanded its seating capacity without the proportinal expansion of kitchen capacity. the result is that the service is slow and clearly the staff are weary of the stress placed upon them by this imbalance. we waited nearly an hour for the starter, after asking again for it. another long delay before we invoked the five minute rule and then got up, asked for the bill for what we had had, paid and left. down the road is the el nil, excellent shoarma, served within seven minutes of our arrival!"
"the pizzas were ok, nothing very special. the salad was also ok, but i expected something more from italian kitchen."
"business dinner with a colleague. we order to pizzas, nothing spezial. i was expecting more. maybe i made the wrong choice, because the restaurant was full in a thursday evening. some families and couples around.  nice decoration and service. everybody speaks fluent english."
had a seafood pizza. was nothing to get excited about. was expecting a little more that average with such a high rating. beer was flat but saw them pouring the beer and adding old beer from a glass to top it up.
"we placed an order but we got unfortunately the wrong order (their mistake) after a phone call with not a very friendly man they said they would come back and give the new order once arrived they requested extra payment for the correct order .. so we eventually payed twice, we are very unsatisfied. wouldnt recommend this place to anyone"
"although there were lots of food varieties in the menu, since there was no english menu and waitress was not able to help, we chose randomly. i had a pizza and my wife had a pasta. both were below average in taste and look."
"both ordered the same bistecca which was no good, too chewy. the chef said it was not and we could order something else and pay the difference. no sorry, no nothing. poor service. a free cup of coffee is so easy, cheap and can change the feeling of a customer. but no. a sorry costs even less and can change the experience. but no. lot to learn!"
"the restaurant is very customer friendly. deco is also nice and simple. but the food is often unstable of quality. sometines its really good, but most of the time very average. the prices are some what high for the unsteadiness of the quality. but the staff is very nice and deserves second changes. the delivery services are not up to par for the asking price. i will recommend to visit the restaurant."
i had a dinner at restaurant sorrento with a friend. it was during the week and around half of the available tables were occupied. after ordering it took quite some time before we got our dinner served. the food is average. i was not impressed with the service staff. the wine is quite expensive and very few wines to choose from. the pinot grigio tasted to sweet for me. i was expecting the lemon-citrus flavo

"a combination of bad food and unfriendly personnel. huge waiting time, although the place was not full.  ladies toilet was dirty.  there are other places to spend your money. do not go to pompei."
"friendly staff and nice atmosphere but rather bland food, or at least, pizzas. the list of available pizzas is huge, and the pizzas come with abundant toppings, but i can’t say much more than that. unfortunately it all tasted rather bland."
"i took a pizza for me and my husband because of the nice reviews here. but i am considering about my decision after our dinner. just want to be honest, it was not a really pizza, not italian one either. so, we wont choose here for the next time. "
"the waiting time in pompei is quit long and after the long waiting the pizza is almost cold. the prices are also not very cheap. even they have special prices for students i would rather pay more but have a good quality pizza for that money. when the restaurant is crowded it is getting really hot inside. the entrance is also a payment place and the kitchen for the pizza which i personally dont think this is very sanitary. well, i was very disappointed with the pizzeria, especially because it does have a nice rating in here ...."
"the pizza could use fresher ingredients. the dough is a little chewy (raising method?!).. i still havent found a place in the netherlands where they actually use mozzarella instead of just tasteless kaas. we were a big group seated in the back of the restaurant, everybody got home with clothes that stunk like kitche "
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of récola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"we had a dinner yesterday, the risotto porcini was like porridge, although we told the waiter that it was terrible, either he or the owner didnt make any effort to apologise, or to cook it again, the dish was very pricey, normally you expect higher standard. be careful they also charge for parmesan cheese to sprinkle on your risotto. it is a reap off, stay away from them."
"i just had the worst pizza ever. in a place that was recommended as serving the best pizza in town. perhaps they have good ones but the frutti di mare i tried had the worst bottom i have ever had. so soggy it was as if there was pasta carrying the filling. that filling consisted of mussels, shrimps, tuna and perhaps other things. too much too salty. deeply disappointing. be cautioned."
"not sure what we missed, nice people and a very cosy restaurant. pizzas not too bad, definitely not that great, pasta was too dry, sauce too thick, way too much pasta. the rest of the family ate their dishes but i just couldn’t eat much of my marinara pasta, sauce too thick & dry, tiny shrimps, tuna all mushed up in the sauce, like a mashed up lasagna. mine was really bad."
came here to get some lunch- ordered a brownie to share afterwards. about half the brownie was okay. not great (and served straight from the fridge) but acceptabl 
"im italian and it is not easy at all to find a decent pizza abroad. however, the pizza that this restaurant offers is super nice and almost the same as the one that i am used to eat at hom "
"the people/restaurantstaff in leeuwarden are so friendly when it comes to tableservice. inside there are loads of tables and a chilled vibe. we had a nice table on the terrace, drinking wine & peroni. the service was really fast and we had our pizzas in no time. the pizzas though, were not great."
"it was a nice surprise, it looks very cozy, quiet and not very busy. there is a lot of space for dinning. the food was ok, and the decoration i also liked it. not bad. (the olive oil is not italian, it is from spain. good choice 😉)"
"nice decor, lovely food, service was not good. way understaffed although the staff were really nice and friendly. 14 or 15 euros for most pizzas or pastas, desserts fairly priced, some starters over priced."
"we selected this restaurant based on its high rating in google maps. the service is very good but the pizza is average. the dough is good and crunchy but the topping is disappointing, very little amount of cheese. i was expecting more."
"friendly service but poor food.started with popcorn with paprika and a kind of kerry dipsauce which is a strange choice for an appetizer;i had the gnocchi which were tasteful but the main course(fresh fish) was very disappointing,sauce was too thick,fish not really fresh...the white wine proposed by the waiter was a viognier montmarin and was very good.i hope it was just a bad day for the cook because the service was friendly but the food bad and clumsy presentation."
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.
"the choices of pasta offered on the menu were relatively disappointing. i expected to have a lot more and extraordinary ways of how to serve pasta, however, i experienced the menu being not very satisfying and quite usua "

"was not good,we eated in this restaurant but atmosphere and food was totaly not real italian.we are use to eat and be served much better in italy"
tables are close togeth 
this restaurant is really not what you want. the menu is very outdated. there are things crossed out and written in pen. so maybe its time for them to order some new me 
we have been to this restaurant twice: is located in the center city and all the waiters are italians like the own 
little family owned restaurant serving average food. if youre looking for a 10 euros gaz-oven-baked pizza you would probably be happy. definitely not worth the visit. if youre hesitating with other places i suggest you try them first.
"the food and portion size is ok. i think the chef buys the cheapest ingredients available and not the best. the service is alright we were welcomed and placed at a table politely. it was busy and we had to wait a bit (but just not too) long for our meals. the decor seems somewhat old, but that is sometimes also the case in italy and for me not the main thing. the tables were dressed with nice linnen tablecloth and serviettes rather than with paper which i myself appreciat "
the interior of the restaurant is just outdated and it looks ready for renovation. i was disappointed by the quality of the food and the lack of passion that apparently went into it.we had a caprese which was unexciting and a tournedos which vos reasonable but not superb that the winds were fine and the waiter took time to explain the origin 
"not amazed, was a normal pizza and pasta, not special. don’t understand why this is nr1 on tripadvisor. pizza was good but really standard, pasta with truffle was no fresh truff "
"not worth the money, 14 euro for a tiny portion of mediocre lasagna is not worth it.  the ragu (bolognese) isnt seasoned properly. and lacks flavor.   i am really disappointed. i expected a lot more."
"an italian restaurant with a good atmosphere in arnhem centre, immediately near the shopping area. we enjoyed good pasta and nice fish, nothing wrong with that. but i found the prices rather exaggerated (my main course was 24,50 for a good piece of fish, two half potatoes, one small tomato etc. not quite enough for this sort of price. tasty bread was charged extra, a 75cl bottle of sparkling water at 5,75. i mean, come on.) staff were very friendly and helpful, though."
"we came back after 10 years. the food is still the reason to come here. dont mind the 70ties interior. the service is not italian, the people didnt find the right approach and our waiter was topping up our glasses too often, which felt unpleasant. we missed the italian hospitality."
"we had dinner here in april. my daughter had a vegetarian option, i had a rib-eye steak. the food was good but overpriced and service was leisurely."
3 of us booked a table 6.00 we ordered 2 pizzas and a starter it was a mess we orderd a wine each. while we were waiting...and waiting and waiting!!! our bill was 70 euros mostly for the wine.. we were shocked.. girls were very nice but kitchen was chaos.. it took 2 hours before we got our dinner..also no anchovis..no green olives... never again!!!
"waiting for 1,5 hours and still the pizza wasnt the "
we went here with a group of 8. we got a table all the way back at the restaurant. lets say it was not the most cosy place they could give u 
"for this occassion we ate from the special ah-spaarkaart menu. luckily this did not mean that there was hardly choice. still we could either chose from this menu or a pasta / pizza. well done! good taste. my oven roasted chicken was delicious, bit cheesy though. "
"pastas is ok. doesnt taste like pastas in italy. staff are kind and helpful, cousy and easy to find from central station. toilets are clean but old and a bit messy. prices are reasonable."
"what do you expect from the pizza chain? a decent pizza at a good price. pasta dishes also available, but i did not have that. the pizza is exactly what you would expect."
"it is cheap; too cheap to make an eatable pizza obviously. the bottom is prefab; tasteless. topping of tuna: dry and no taste. no herbs, nothing. to add some flavour. my wifes pizza was little better."
tried here once very noisy and very very cramped more a young crowd place food was food nothing to talk about we will not be back
visited november 2013. english is spoken and there are english menus availab 
"slightly off the tourist track, this is a cosy restaurant worth trying if you fancy an italian. service was a little slow at times (hence the 3/5 score), but it was a very relaxed experience and the food was cooked well. i had the rigatoni all’arrabiata - delicious. very good value."
"the food at zafvino has always been great - along with the wines and wonderful antipasti, nothing to complain about. i think zafvino should consider to limit the amount of guests on the terrace if they want to keep the quality of their service hi "
"we made a reservation for indoors but turned up early for a drink beforehand. although there seemed to be many available tables outdoors under shelter where we would have been happy to sit in the meantime, we were offered a seat at a table apart, halfway in the rain. declining this, we left and returned for our meal; however, it didn’t seem they were expecting us, despite our arrival 45 minutes earlier. they offered us a place on bar-stools, while again, there were tables indoors available. when we asked to move, we were given a table near the entrance, where people were stood waiting to be seated. in these times of social distancing, this did not seem appropriate. we opted to leav "
"bustling restaurant, busy, nice atmosphere. we were allocated a spot where you practically needed a torch to see your food - extremely dark. moved - “that’s better...” wine was good! but waitress forgot half our food order. food took ages to arrive. difficult to get attention of waitresses. very frustrating. cos otherwise the place isn’t bad "
zafvino is one of my favourite places in arnhem however tonight i was quite disappointed by the services. it was full of young service (nothing wrong with that) only they were not attentive and there seemed to be no senior staff around. it’s not a bargain place so service should be to par it would be a shame that such an amazing wine and food place losses clients because of an easily solved problem. you can do better zafvino 
poor food poor service. the location is ok but the food is less than on would expect. service is poor asked for some extra bread never arrived.  perhaps for the best . not a place to sit and relax.
"arrogant service and presumptuous attitude. asked to see the wine list to be told there was not one and that the waiters were the wine list. upon asking, limited or no knowledge of italian wines. they claim to be an italian restaurant. food was average to good and the ambience was nice. its just a pity that the service dampens the overall quality of the evening. will not go there again."
"probably i was really unlucky, but my experience with this place was very ba "

"ive been at pinoccio during a business trip, advised by loca "
we have been coming to this restaurant for many years on our annual visit to arnh 
"if you want a quick pizza or pasta you can have it here. do not expect the best of food. it is a cosy restaurant near to shops, cinema and theater."
"its a cheap pizzeria and you get your value for money. a fine place for a catch up with friends, without breaking the bank."
rubbish rubbish rubbish and more rubbish the food was tasteless cannot think of anything good to say about it
"i went here with my partner because it is a famous place for pizzas. i will never come back. the pizza didn´t have any cheese and when we complain about it the service was really rude to us. the local is big but they put too many people and tables next to each other, you can´t eat confortably. i will not recomend this place,"
ok this place is cheap and convenient but quality is quite low. our pizzas were rather tasteless and the dough is clearly neither homemade nor properly baked. and why would you add fat on the crust to make it shine? this is nowhere to be found in italy and only makes pizzas look greasier than they are. add slow service and you wont get the romantic dinner you were expecti 
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
the pizza ( thin crust and very good) and pasta were good but we waited 45 minutes in an empty restaurant.  not worth the wait.

"this is an average, nothing special pizza/past joint, good quality freshly prepared dishes. the service is really good with orders taken promptly and attentive throughou "
"i dont know why so many good reviews were written, we found that the pizzas were ok, but the pastas were not good. the pasta was overcooked and the souse was not tasty."
"we had 2 pastas. mine was ok. the cabonara was with too much creme and to less eggs. but for the price it was ok. if u want quality, this isnt your place maybe. choose it yourself."
they do not know how to prepare italian pasta which was b 
"service was ok and the establishment seemed to be run with teenaged staff. the food was ok but lacked seasoning, and the salad was very oily. my husband said the pizza was good."
"after reading the excellent reviews on tripadvisor we decided to try this place out. the place looks nice: clean, a sunny terrace surrounded by greenery, kind staff, and very family- and dog friend "
"the food itself was ok, nothing special...the experience was ruined by very slow service and a terrible waiter that assisted us during our visit."
pizza bottom was totally burned. the top side was good. i was mainly busy cutting the burned parts out to be able to eat some of it. the place is called “happy italy”. as a customer i am not happy at all.
"because i had a very bad customer service, long time to be served, the food (pizza) came with bad smell (tomato was damaged) and we feel bad when we arrived home."
"the food has never been good, my pasta was cold and tasted horrible. there is no hygiene in the place, my table was dirty and literally had ants and spiders in it."
the service was friendly and efficient. the food was good with large portions.the pizzas looked good but i had the pasta. it was a big serving and was good. only problem was it wasnt very hot all the way through. good atmosphere for large groups. reasonably priced for families.
"when my friend pitched the idea that we eat at happy italy for dinner, i agreed in a heartbeat since i havent tried the food there yet. everything was seemingly efficient at first as we were greeted at the restaurants entrance, seated, and our orders taken without any fuss. their dishes are so-so but reasonably priced given their serving si "
"yesterday we went with the family to happy italy for an easy dinner. weve been there before and it was quite alright. also, we had take away and it was tast "
the shrimp wasnt fresh. it tasted too hard and die. so pity but the waiter is cute and polite. i dont recommend here for the dating or family. it has a good spot near by the station. thats all.
"while nothing to write home about, this restaraunt had quick service, the food was very hot and quite filling, and it was unbelievably cheap. i mean, cheaper than mcdonald’s cheap. for under 5€ you can get a massive ceasar salad with chicken. pizzas were in the 6-9€ range, and were large enough to serve two, unless you are absolutely starving. however, the pizza is a ready made, bland to the point of tasteless , crus "
the food is cheap and you definitely receive a lot for less. i think the concept must be appealing for teenagers. the quality of the food is matching its price.
"large portions and attentive staff, but very noisy and clearly a chain. pastadish seemed pre-cooked - although it was fine, pasta was a bit mushy and the sauce bland."
"after 2 meals, lunch and dinner, i am sure of one thing. i am not the demographic. that is pretty obvious when you look at the food and decoration. a large hall servicing mainly a younger crowd, more accustomed to take out. less discerning than a regular diner. the food came out way too fast. pasta was precooked and was on the verge of mush, the pizza was undercooked and soggy. the portions are also double the regular restaurant standards. the pasta was thinly coated with sauce and would have been better served with half the amount of pasta. i noted this to the servers, and the answer was that many diners prefer larger portion "
big dininghal that supposedly should have good food. started with standing in a cue outside that lasted almost 15 minutes before we got in. the pizza then came half baked with almost raw vegetables on top.... if you cant handle so many customers at once then please let someone wait 10 minutes longer but at least serve descent food! i do not recommend this place and will not return there again.
"everything was good, the group of us, 20 students from different countries who just met was having a nice time. then we had to pay and instead of making it separately, happy italy forced us to pay all together. and thanks to their tremendous effort of altruism and empathy they let us pay in 2 groups in the end! oh how good you are happy italy. what a pitty that next time i wont go with a group..."
this restaurant pretends to be an authentic italian restaurant but its just not really good. the pasta was barely warm and kind of blend. the service was good but the atmosphere in the restaurant was not so pleasant. i wouldnt go there again and i cant recommend it. 
"owner told us to move as they needed the table, after 20 minutes whilst we still had coffee onnits way.   never go here."
not so gud ol fast but chip products i dont like the service the pizza its veryyy bad no crispi nothing  dont go ther chip bat bad products
"on a budget and hungry? then this place will suit your needs, just dont expect anything special. its a large restaurant, the concept is serving a lot of people very quickly, with insane amounts of food for a fair price. the food is ok, service is friendly and very fast. but if its a great pizza/pasta you want and a little more atmosphere, there are better places to go in arnhem"
"great for a quick bite before going to the movies. food is at the table faster than your drink, within 10min of ordering. not the best though, but suits the prices you pay. with all the (better) italian restaurants in arnhem, i wouldnt return here any time soon."
plus - big portions and cheap. service is friendly. possibly to do doggyba 
industrial food. bulk purchase. low to non existent quality. this restaurant is intended for kids with no budget to speak of you can stomach anything. cardboard flavoured pas 
"really slow and bad service. we waited for almost an hour for all our orders. the waitress forgot to tell us that our order wasnt possible, so we found out by accident that we were waiting in vai "
they forgot my order. my mate was long done with his pizza before my pasta arrived. the pasta itself was also terrible. not recommended
the best thing about this spot is that it has good atmosphere and is cosy and warm (in cold or rainy day). food was average compensated partly by friendly waiters. it seems to be popular place as it was very busy. it is about one street away from the marketpla 
"service was quite slow, pizzas average and had toppings not included on the menu(not great if you dislike capsicum) and charged 7 euro for some bread to start, which, given it’s an italian restaurant, i would have thought was free or at least way less than a pizza! disappointing experience, will be sure to explore another option next time. "
"after 4-5 minutes waiting at the door to get seated (as the sign says) and a few eye contacts met the waiters, we left. it was about 60-70% full on a saturday afternoon, not a super busy period. i’m willing to wait longer for a table, but i don’t like to be ignored. doesn’t really work well in the hospitality business..."
"well, i should be honest and fair. pizza is a kind of “roma style”, so dough is very thin everywhere, and this was the case. ingredients were not tasty at all, not easy to feel cheese or ham or salami taste. the problem was that, this combination had a bad digestive consequences, that means cheese was not ok and dough not well don "
visited this restaurant on a tuesday evening. the restaurant is situated very convenient at the center of the city. the interior is contemporary which fits the location it is i 
"dont really like to give negative reviews but in this case i had too :( went in with the idea of getting a good fast food pasta. went to a similar concept of a restaurant in groningen, and zappas did not come near the quality of the groningen one. the service was just not good. when we got to the table we did not get a menu. after a while i asked the neighbours one. there were no options in type of pasta, only penne. i ordered the napilotana, and when i got it it had huge chunks of badly cut onions... they were not included in the description. the pizza the bf ordered was pretty descend. overall it was not really a fun experience."
the service it’s terrible and the dishes cooked without any comprehension of italian cooking style. item a typical dutch appetizers such as cheese plate was served without any consideration of the cheeses and the quality of product used was extremely law. i think they just work thanks to their amazing location. 
"when we visited the place just opened, so it might be one of the reasons we did not like it. staff had no coordination between each other. we asked for drinks three different waiters and after half an hour we still did not have our beers. then, the waitress came to double check which drinks we ordered. not professional. pizza was very average. "
"if you are tired after shopping or spending the day in the city center and want to quickly have dinner, this is a good place to go to; pricing is questionable for the quality of food but isnt expensive."
"great style, good food (no average italian, but a bit out of the box menu), okay drinks menu but the service was poor. they forgot half of our order, we had to wait long to get served and when we wanted tonpy the guy didnt even look at us while talking, hard to understand... however, the price and quality were good so ill give it a second chance and hopefully the service be better then. "
"very pleasant service, nice place but full deception with food. i travel a lot in many countries, italy too & its the worse i ever tested. lasagna without any taste at all, tiramisu still frozen in the plate, what a pity."
"the restaurant is situated at the south of amsterdam, named as amstelveen district. as the district does not have too many prime options, this place comes to top destinations in terms of ambiance. indoor and outdoor sitting options together with the design increases your expectatio "
"be aware the service staff is totally not trained or have even any experience, you have to wait a long time for your food, one point of time te waiter go and redo te string of his shoes without washing his hands he take the cutleries and serve the table i told mij wijf look at this and guess what happen he served our table i went en clean the cutleries first, than at 21.30 hr a whole tray of beer went in to the kitchen and all kitchen staff started to drink beer and wines. as said its manage as family business without service. the restaurant is so noisy and on top of this every 20 minutes your loud throughout the restaurant the happy birthday songs voor children parties of adult dinners , you want to have a nice dinner without stress this is sure not the place as the tables are packed on each other for that even the food is quite good but the rest you have to forget."
"this restaurant is a prime location for gorden ramsey to save! if you want to spend alot of money for an unripe tomatoe and fake mozerrela passing as bufola , wait two hours for soggy pasta in a puddel of canned tamatoe sause bought at the local supermarkt, be my guest as you will not be theirs as they do not care about you ,at all! the service was arrogant, extremely slow,and unresponsive. do youself a favor and look somewhere else. the are some great restaurants in the area, this is certianly not one."
"i went for take away pizza here in corona time. they were open for business which deserves a compliment. i wish i could say the same about the pizza. it was well below par - tasteless pie and cheap ingredients. i don’t know it this is related to the corona times, but i fear not. not recommended - there is plenty much better pizza around"
"we ordered pizza at home, it was disgusting. the ingredients are cheap as hell how dare you calling mozzarella a cheap cheese? never again, there are so many good places to eat, stay away from this one.."
"first time nearby town decided to try out this restaurant.  food: average, too much salt on my rib eye. overall texture was good.  the tiramisu is nice, balance taste and soft.  ambience: overall very comfortable environment, good for family gathering place. nice backyard."
"ambience of the restaurant was nice, service staff friendly.. unfortunately the food was. it up to m "
"nice ambiance. terribly slow service. staff does not look around to see if anyone needs service. we had to chase up staff for every step of the way: our first drink, for a menu-card, for ordering the food, for a dessert-menu card, for the dessert. my own main course was fine; my partners was much too salty. after again having had to wait for 10 minutes for someone to order our dessert we decided to leave without the dessert as no one was paying any attention to our attempts to snare a staff member. our total visit lasted 90 minutes in which we managed to drink 2 glasses of wine and have a main course; most of the time was spent on waiting and trying to attract attention from the staff. as no staff paid any attention we left our table to get the bill and pay at the till, where the staff member had the temerity to state we had only had to wait 5 minutes before being serv "

"with a colleague of mine we decided to have a dinner here during a business trip, after learning that the food was excellent. when we entered the restaurant we were not impressed by the atmosphere inside, which seemed a bit old and not entirely proper. the garden, however, was amazing and we sat outside with pleasure. it was a spacious garden with green view and wonderful sunshi "
"we came to the netherlands for a few days with my girlfriend. opposite our hotel there was this pizzeria. what a bad experience. the person who works there, the cook and the owner are all 1 person. loves money and only wants money. because he has no passion for food. how sad. ordered pizza and pasta that have nothing to do with italy. we were also not allowed to pay by card. the pin device was not on. we had to pay in cash. obliged. kind of scam. stay away from here"
this is honestly really awful. you cant call this pizzeria. pizza was really small compare to the amount. cheese was dirty and gross. supermarket pizza from the freezer tastes better than this. for all people this is really bad. last time here. not recommended
"small restaurant in the middle of amstelveen, right outside amsterdam. parking is a bit sketchy if you come by car. the restaurants interior is ok but nothing to write home about. we were there about 2 hours ago so everything is still fresh in my mind. because were a friday evening the restaurant was packed and extremely noisy. making a reservation is recommended. my wife and i had read good reviews so we went in with expectatio "
it was nice pizza and vibe but the manager was quite rude to the family beside us taking away the menus for the desert because they spent too much time make the pizza. the manager was verbally fighting back and not showing respect to the customers 
"kai the manager was already so rude on the phone that we were repelled straight away. even for dutch standards this is absolutely poor. asking me on the phone what time i want to join, me telling the time and then being told that actually theyre fully booked is not okay. why even bother to ask me then?! and then giving me a speech. not okay. either you have a table or not, but then please say so straight away and dont talk back to your guest and give an attitude."
"when we arrived the restaurant was full with families with kids. but we were offered a table at the window. they sell wine only by the glass of bottle, no caraf. the wine was great. they serve only pizza and no pasta. we ordered the diavola and four chees "
"i had a terrible experience with this pizza place today (order 13862907 made at amstelveen location - eleanor rooseveltlaan 2, 1183 cl amstelveen). even after waiting for more than 2 hours, did not get the pizza. however this is not the concern as this can happen at any shop and place, but what is concerning was the behavior of the delivery guy. this is the sequence of even "
"ordered side dishes and a dessert for delivery. website did not mention order must contain a pizza, and the order went through. waited for 1,5 hour then called and apparently our order was cancelled. they did not call/text/mail but thought it would be okay to let us starve..."
wanted to try something new - usually order from another place. pizza arrived half hour late and cold. when i called for complaining the operator put the phone on me. never use them again.... really sad to see such poor service. not sure if the franchise owner knows what is going on in amstelveen but it would be worth them to check in my opinion and do something - suggest to help stuff in better planning resources and send the operator to a ‘customer service 0.1 for beginners’ course...
"friday night dinners mostly consists of take-outs in our household. even though we do have our favourites were always keen to try new places. papa johns, even though part of a big american fast food chain opened in amstelveen recently so, we thought wed give it a go. walking in, there were quite a few glum looking people who seemed to have been waiting for some time. once you placed your order, a label with your name an order number is stuck on pizza boxes and then you wait...and wait. we went to albert hein close by to do a small shop, came back and waited some more. after another 15 minutes i was ready to ask for my money back but my son asked me to be patient. after about 45 min in total we got our pizzas and some sides. i must also add that the place lacks atmosphere with the staff moving about like theyre at a funeral...depressing to say the least! also, they dont use a wood fired oven but one of those cheap & nasty conveyor pizza ovens. getting home i expected the worst and wasnt disappointed...the pizzas were absolutely horrible! soft doughy soft base and the tomato sauce sour with a mingy amount topping...yuck "
"unpolite service, tasteless ingredients and terrible pizza. greasy cheese and soggy base. not recommended."
"nothing great to mention, staff isnt professional. not kip options to select from. its rather bland in nature with a crumpled sitting."
"it wasnt great at all, lacked salt. staff however was courteous. no kip item so to mention.  ..  .  .  ."
"this is one of the few real pizzerias in amstelveen. we visited it quite a few times and the atmosphere is relaxed and child friendly. the pizzas are of a good quality and thave he right size. the only thing i don’t understand is the change in the wine policy. formerly one could order wine in in a caraf of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 cl, but now you can order only bottles of wine. this not only is much more expensive but also offers less flexibility. so please change it!"
"once upon a time this was a nice, cheap and cheerful neighbourhood italian bistro but that time sadly appears to be gone. tasteless, awful, inedible food that for a large part appears to have been bought-in from some second-rate cash and carry outlet before being inexpertly warmed up. the waiter didnt seem to be at all surprised all three of the diners plates went back largely untouched, so i dont think think the current car crash is a sudden phenomenon."
"feels genuinely italian - children very welcome, you can watch the pizza dough being spun, pasta and risotto dishes very tasty."
"i dont recommend this restaurant for asiana family. we went there, and the waitresses treated us very rude. it was a kind of discrimination i feel. the treat local dutch people very nice, but not to asiana. i dont suggest asiana people to visit this restaurant."
"we visited this restaurant twice and both times the service was bad. very unfriendly and rude staff, but the food is really good."
"don’t go to this restaurant after 9:00 because you will probably get rude treatment. my husband and i were craving good italian so we came here. we arrived quite late because we were traveling far, so we understood the inconvenience. when we came in, everyone stared at us like we were the worst for coming in that late. we asked the waitress if it was too late and said we didn’t have to stay, but she said “we’re happy you’re here” and looked like she meant it so we thought, “great we’ll have a nice dinner but eat quickly so they don’t have to stay late for us. that was the last bit of friendliness we received. they sat us in the corner and took so long to bring menus or drinks. everyone else in the almost full restaurant was enjoying themselves and still eating when we sat down. the main waiter was refilling wine glasses, bringing people complimentary chocolates and laughing with other customers. obviously not in a hurry to leave. but he did not acknowledge us or welcome us. he just came by with a paper and looked at us to take our order. when he took it he left without a smile. we spent about $55 for the most uncomfortable, nice tasting italian food we’ve ever had. all we wanted to do was leave. they made us feel so out of place. we ate and left before some of the others had even finished their wine and they were still cold to us as we left. we couldn’t help but notice the waiter brought everyone a plate of chocolates with their check, but never brought us one. the food was fine but not worth it for our horrible experience. my husband ordered the pumpkin ravioli which doesn’t have meat but was still 16 euros. it was very good, but i ordered a pasta with “bacon” which ended up being thick pieces of pork that had a strange flavor. me least favorite meal of the whole trip. "
very popular restaurant  but the children enjoyed. not a brilliant location but near lots of housing.  service was good.

"veri sapori´s main attraction is passionate owner mario bianco. he´s a fun host and our first visit a year ago was a great experience. sadly, it seems the rave reviews soon after opening this restaurant has lead to complacancy. our last visit this month was a major disappointment. our waiter seemed uninterested. his choice of wine was totally off and the dishes were ok, but otherwise uninspiring. we could have done better cooking ourselves and we´re no master chefs. as the prices are quite hefty, we expect better from mario!"
if you can live with some traditional slow dutch service the food will compensate. fantastic pastas with the spaghetti vengole as the clear favorite in a nice ambiance with a lot of people despite the fact that we booked a table already at 1800. we will most likely be back but not at peak hours...
picture th 
food is very good but it takes very long till it’s delivered. very kind service! but very bad wifi. but the workers are very kind!
nothing special to say. an italian like so many others. their pizza was a bit too salty and prices are more on the high side for the quality. but ok got to fast although the restaurant was busy and the staff is rather courtious.
ordered via thuisbezorgd (home delivery) a cafoncella pizza. it was super salty and prosciutto di parma was just a normal ham you put on your bread in the morning. also my friend ordered salami pizza but it was just normal salami looking ham.
"we have been in this restaurant many times and love the food. however, they charge extra for things that leaves a bad feeli "
"we received delivery pizza from this place and it was inedible, we threw it in the bin and called the restaurant to complain. the base was limp, stale and tasteless, the topping was like lumps of salt in chewy cheese."
"we made a reservation for 8 persons, including a 9 month old baby. requested a child seat, not an iss "
"for an italian restaurant, i would say on average the food was disappointing. the main course fish was very good, the arancini i had as a starter were tasteless. wine was nice and the staff are very friendly but not very experienced and didnt seem to have much training. location looked nice but we only got a seat in the bar area as the main restaurant with the nice view was full."

"terrace on a great location in lemmer. had the pizza, which was ok. the staff was very young, and they didnt always seem to be able to take care of the guests."
"sorry, maybe next time "
"we went here for a second try after a mediocre experience before. the atmosphere is nice, but suffers a bit from the locations design with the open kitchen in the middle and the noise which comes with it especially when it is crowd "
after waiting for 20+ minutes on just one drink before anyone cared to take our order. then we waited for 50 more minutes only to find out that they had completely forgotten about us. as you can imagine i do not advice going there if you actually want to eat. 
i had the pizza marinara and it was ok but relied too heavily on tinned fish. the vegetable lasagne was better. the service was not very good; there being one person other than the cook doing everything. and he struggled. it was a cold wet monday when we visited so i expect they were not anticipating the ten customers there.
"with 2 friends (total a party of 4) and a bill of 180 for a small piece of meat for me, a large piece of salmon and 2 plates of pasta. the potatoes were old and the sauces were so, so. the waiter was friendly but his co-worker (a young lady of about 25) was very insecure. no typical italian atmosphere. the website looks fine, the menu looks fine, but in th real world: i am never going back to that restaurant. not worth. no value for money."
"the restaurant is now called “trattoria italiana diga”. my review? terrible service and terrible food! we sat at the terrace as the weather was quite good (for april). the waitress came quite quickly to take our order (spaghetti with mussels and gambas, spaghetti with tomato sauce (kid portion) and a pizza tonno). the two orders of spaghetti arrive. first comment: i asked mine to be served with spicy sauce. never ate such a blend spaghetti even after adding more salt and pepper. impossible to eat it. my husband’s pizza was nowhere to be seen even after 10 min of our orders being served. we waited and waited, until i decided to call again the waitress (another one came). we asked for the pizza, spicy olive oil and parmesan. we had to wait another 10 min until the pizza arrived (letting us guess that the order had never been placed). the spicy olive oil? i had to ask for it again (btw: my pasta was served with just half a dozen gambas, the mussels were missing in combat!). the parmesan? never came. the pizza was as blend as my spaghetti and the lack of “spicy” in the spicy olive oil didn’t help in my already stretched patienc "
"went there for diinner because we saw the menu posted outside and it looked great. a waiter greeted us and told us to have a seat anywhere and he would find us. we seated ourselves and never saw the waiter again. after about ten minutes of waiting to be served and our dirty table cleaned, we finally had to flag down a waiter to order. we placed our order and the food was deliverd by another waiter. we ate our complete meal without anyone asking how our meal was or do we need anything else. i looked for a waiter to get our check and finally we got the attention of a person and they told us to go inside to pay. and by the way, we asked for a couple of glasses of tap water and was told that was not available, only by the bottle for sale. yes, they got us.. i eneded up buying one without asking the price...5 euros. we are here in town for 4 more nights and we wont return."
"very nice place, but after 1h i’m still sitting here and no one has served us anything. asked once to the blond waitress working on saturdays and i have to say i’m amazed by how rude she was. about the food i have no clue, i’ll let you now if they bring it."
really bad service. we’ve waited for 45min and nothing was served. i’ll never come back and seriously won’t recommend.
the service was slow. not enough staff on the floor. asked which cheeses were on the plate. waiter didntt know. had as main course pasta 4 formagi. no flavour on it and when i said that to the waiter. i got extra gratin cheese to give it a little bit of flavour. the interieur is out dated. they have a wonderfull place. hopefully they make something out of this. by
"i have been quite a few times to this restaurant and the pizzas have always been good (see my review from january 2015 which was very positive). my visit yesterday however will be my last. the pizza menu has drastically changed, and not for the better. the choice includes some very strange combinations, none of which appealed to me. i made my own choice of topping therefore (i used to order their fine frutti do mare). the pizza that arrived was very poor indeed. thin base, barely cooked on the middle, a smear of tomato sauce and a topping very meager on the fish front. there should have been salmon, mussels and anchovies but almost none of the above were to be found. what was a lot of were cherry tomatoes, olives and basil leaves. possibly the worst pizza i have every eat "
"the atmosphere is quite nice and cosy, waitresses were friendly and attentive even though it was bu "
"okay, this is one of the few restaurants in town, so it is always a take it or leave i "
nice patio out front to watch the people go by in this little town. we were there for lunch and only had sandwiches but the italian menu looked to have a large selection. service was okay they seem to either own the other few restaurants on the street as the waitress kept running back and forth between them and they had to run next door to get the credit card machine.
"trattoria artusi is located in the bilderberg hotel in oosterbeek. the location is stunning, beautiful hotel surrounded by nature and plenty of free parking spaces. the restaurant has a good ambiance, comfortable seats and excellent lighting. the service is good, well trained waiters with knowledge of etiquette "
we choose to sta in the hotel restaurant as it had a good review on iens and on tripadvis 
"set in lovely surroundings this trattoria unfoortunately is simply average and given the final bill even overpriced. it has a a very average choice of items on the menu, all of course based on the italian cuisine. we selected a 4 course surprise menu but afterwards kind of regretted our choice: unspectacular grilled tuna, followed by an average pasta and mediocre steak. there seemed to be a lot more attractive items on the menu but we didnt taste those and hopefully they are prepared with more passion and ingenuity than what we were served. the staff is very kind though, perhaps a little popular, and the wines were really nic "
we selected this restaurant because it offered a different menu than what we usually find in the dutch restaurants in this region. it was also one of the few italian restaurants whose main menu item is not piz 
went to this restaurant based on reviews / ratin 
lucca is located overlooking the elburg harbour. i had noticed the restaurant some time ago and was excited that we could now enjoy true authentic italian food. the restaurant is nice but the food was somewhat disappointing. it was missing that wow factor.
my pizza was extremely salty. it tasted extremaly bad. my friends took calzone and it also tasted very poorly. big portions but it was so bad that i ate less than half. i do not recommend this restaurant. moreover the waitress was not nice.
"proseco foscari, stale, no bubles from what appears to be some from ope left over. bottle. minuscule portion of ravioli, oily, tasteless. 8 pieces, 10, luckwarm, oily and tasteless. menu 15, but charged 16.50. seafood pasta, a lot of spahetti, many shells but some with nothing in it, empty shells. oily, little taste. very limited menu, no pizzas. dutch beers not available. one of the worse dining experience and we left halfway, paying a hefty bill for what was in essence not good food and way too expensive in comparisson with pro eran restsurant near by. they will not see me again."
"the salmon filet was but skin and bones, and when we brought it to the attention of the waitress she said shed tell the cook. there was no response until the cook-owner came by and my husband mentioned again that the salmon was very tough and primarily bones. the owner then reacted in a very unprofessional way: he lost his temper and grabbed all of our plates away - even the half eaten one of our elderly mother, who was protesting that she wanted to finish her food. to no avail. the other people next to us were so shocked by witnessing this that they said they would never come back again. we have never had such an awful experience befo "
"this used to be a nice restaurant, the last delivery was so bad. it took over 90 minutes for the delivery, and not only did we get wrong order, it was also disgusting. be aware if you ordered here before, it has become a low budget restaurant with very bad service and quality. don’t make the same mistake as us thinking they made good pizza’s, unfortunately this is not the case anymore. also they did nothing to solve the problem, people move on to the next restaurant to find your pixza."
"we ordered 2 calzone for delivery on 13-12-2021. they arrived and while the first few bites were ok, in the middle it was completely cold. just little unmelted square blocks of cheese. we called to complain and were offered replacements, but to be truthful after eating almost half there was no point in starting another. i asked if we could have a credit for next time, but that was not possib "
"good taste, good price, good service but . "
"this is a horrible time to own a restaurant. the government restrictions on gatherings means closure for the restaurant world. what is left is take-away or home delivery. i have chosen the latter three times since the summer from fratelli voorburg, the latest being yesterday eveni "
food good but the service was so slow.we waited for nearly an hour for our starters. i would recommend the for atmosphere and food.
"reservation made but when we arrived staff were not interested! however there were plenty of available tables. it is somewhat confusing that there is a fratelli i and fratelli ii restaurant side by side! food good, service average. incorrect bill presented at the end of the meal."
"fratelli is a good italian restaurant. the staff is friendly and the service is good. we tried the pizza and it was also good. conclusion: fratelli is a good, but nothing of special italian restaurant"
"restaurant is okay, location is fine, parkingplace at 5 min.walk, nice area. inside is traditional, brownish. there are 2 restaurants, in number two we (6 and kid) were, and it is i guess the part where they put groups and familys together, which makes it very noisy. the planning is very poor, it took a long time before they took the order, and the people after us, even two tables, got their meal first. not one time they came at the table to ask for anything, and we tried, but could not get some more wine before the end of the meal. it really takes away the pleasure of going out to dinner. not unfriendly, but not friendly either. we left without desert nor coffee, which is exceptional. not coming back here. food is okay, average."
"i absolutely love their food. the pizza is excellent, especially the pizza carpaccio, i love to do a take away there. but their planning is horrible, service isnt so good. a few points of improvement and they will score 4 points for me!"
reception was ok. wardrobe is far too small and the tiles on the floor underheath are dirty!! im glad i have not visited the toilet. upon entering our name was checked and a nice table was given. between fireplace and aquarium. there is a place on coaches to wait for your table if it is bu 
we visited the restaurant as a family and were looking for good vegetarian italian food. the choices were limited but we really liked what we got. the service was very prompt and friendly.
friendly but a little dark and faded but the food is good. pizzas are all good value and freshly prepared. wont break the bank and you can always get a seat.
"this is a pizza place with a pizza cook who does this for many many years. we never eat there anything other than pizza, for other food we go to other restaurants. value for money and simple. do not go there to have an exclusive business dinner."
"this is probably the explanation for an  inordinate love of chopped leek on pizza. the food is isnt bad, the restaurant isnt really enticing, but you end up having an acceptable meal in a rather cosy little place."
i live locally and have been several times. i love the mushroom risotto and always have it when visiting. it is delicious. what disappoints me here though is that you cannot get a glass of tap water even though we were ordering wine and beer. why i asked? we dont serve it was the reply. not good enough.
"i had a not so pleasant(food amd customer wise) . the service was welcoming and polite. i came here by myself to have a quick dinner. i ordered a calamari fritti as a starter followed by a mushroom and ham pizza. i started my calamari and after the 3rd or the 4th calamari ring was sitting a big fat hair ( not mine i have sort (5-6mm blond hair) on one mine squid ring. . came the waitress after a while and ask me that everything is alright? i said i lost my appetite for this calamari because there is a big hair sitting on my food. i dont want to eat this. without to offer a new portion or any effort to make better thier mistake, i got my pizza. ( unsliced , with a pizza slicer rolling knof by side ..bruuuhhaahaa . i never ever saw this in my life . wtf?! ) pizza was ok 3/5. how ever in the end at the payment they charged me the calamari what i sent back. i said i dont want to pay for that, because i sent it back almost the whole portion. the waitress came back with the idea that i have to pay for the half of it... i asked do i have any other options she said, no... take your judgment. .. but ill never come back or to recommend this place to anyone.

"living near voorburg gave me the opportunity to visit this restaurant with a former colleague. he mentioned i would not be disappointed and indeed even if it is nothing spectacular, we had a nice evening on the terrace under the s "
"nice and friendly reception, the starters were good and promising. unfortunately, the mains were disappointing. it was obviously not the best day for the cook. however, service was good."
this food is only italian for people who have never eaten italian.. low quality cooking with overcooked lasagna drowning in sauce and fast-food level pizza... profoundly disappointed
i dine it here and at the same time ordered for delivery and i can say that this resto is quiet good especially for average budget.
this is my first negative review since i joined trip advisor many years ag 
"frozen pizza, shameful for a restaurant called italian. glass of water that costs 2.10 euros ... run away !"
"have been  a regular here for years. the house pizza is a favourite. other dishes, all italian cuisine, are at least satisfactory or good. the house wine is plonk, but service and atmosphere compensate for that."
"this pizza restaurant that is located in the center of town close to the main shopping street, bars and cafe "
we was here at a sunday. they was about to close but we got pizzas. very friendly waiters. the bosses are good an tasty. outside sitting possible. prices are too high for pizza. from 12 euro and up.
"the drinks were generous and cheap. the food was inedible. thats all i have to say. i have had inedible food about twice in my life thats how bad it was. i would give no stars if possible. my husband and i had totally different meals and his was also awful. i ordered a salad which never came probably good my husbands salad was disgusting, watery. plus we waited 30 minutes for our food with no one in the restaurant!"
"very nice prices at this restaurant. it has italian food plus mexican, pizza, and a good mixture of other entrees. i had a glass of house wine for $3.50 and canneloni for $9.50. max entrée price was under $20."
i paid 30€ for 2 pizza and after 2days still dont have food no food no money back !! guy on reception cant speak english
"very good caprese, but not a great pizza nor atmosphere. prices are relatively high for the quality. service is friendly."
"great italian food. great italian atmosphere. great value for money. was very busy, but we could sit at the last unreserved table. food and drinks italian style. fast service, fast food and good prices."
"went here expecting to have a good dining experience, unfortunately the service was disappointing. the waiters were friendly and helpful, however we got the impression they couldnt cope with all the guest they were serving. we ordered some bread which they forgot and brought after our main dish had arrived, then i ordered some wine and they brought us water. regarding the quality of the food, i wasnt really impressed about it, the meat i ordered was very dry and there was an excess of sauce. definitively in my opinion this place is not worth the visit."
"on our holidaytrip, we stopped at la trattoria in castricum. sitting on a terrace, we had a nice dinner. the food was good, the service fine and the price was fair."
"based on reviews and hearsay we decided to give this trattoria a try. i must say we had a very pleasant evening. the ambiance and the service is more then ok a very friendly and helpfull staff. as for the food i have some remarks. yes everything tasted fine (not spectacular), portion sizes where ok, but in comparison with the prices asked it did not fit the picture completely. when getting a vitello tonato for € 13,50 i expect more, same goes for the grilled fish platter for € 26,50 a person. as said, we did have a nice evening, but at this price level i expect to be more surprised whit what is coming out of the kitchen. will i go back, i think yes, i would like to give it another try with different dishes, hopefully that can change my mind."
innesto has a nice a outside setting making it a good summer choice. i was not hugely impressed with the actual food however the menu is attractive and the service is good.
friendly staff with quick service. quality of food is reasonable. restaurant is located in nobis hotel
"nice place near highway, very good service and decorations in restaurant but food not very good. i order burger all would be ok meat i not minced much too much and have sticky taste. i don;t know what they put inside but was very strange. rest of meal was ok"
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"we thought this would be a nice idea for the kids, they like these kind of all you can eat buffets. they loved the idea of the themed environment in different restaurant styles, so abc seemed for them the summ "
this is an all you can eat buffet restaurant. all the food is cooked and displayed. as you can expect from a buffet restaurant things cool off or taste less than when cooked fresh. some stations offer fresh made dishes. this is a family restaurant. don’t expect quality food or service. essentially overpriced but a nice experience for kids who like to eat different dishes.
"staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean. we paid €92 for two adults and a teenager, no drinks. the food was very overpriced for the quality. the desserts were ok, many of the meats / main dishes seemed dried out. we don’t plan on returning to this restaurant. "
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"definitely a place to avoid. food is expensive and of average quality. service is mediocre and staff, especially the owners, are arrogant. when we visited, the sewer system left a distinctive smell but the staff wasn’t bothered to reac "
"people make mistakes....such as bringing my main course before you bring me the starter i ordered? it went down hill from there. when we finally received our main courses, my husbands was piping hot; mine however was luke warm at best. i should have complained at that point. however, i was tired, it was late and it had been a long da "
"after visiting multiple italian restaurants in the neighbourhood i can state that this place is a pizzeria and not a restaurant. pizzas were ok, nothing special and the wine was average. furthermore, the place lacked atmosphe "
"the pizza on your plate is very good, tasty, crisp bottom, but the surroundings do not improve the experience. the sound of people talking buzzes around in the area. if there are groups/tables with a larger number of clients that order at the same time, the kitchen can not cope with it. the waitresses could have a better feeling if you need e.g. a new drink by walking around in stead of grouping near the counter."
"the staff is really family oriented, efficient and very friendly. food is ok. good to reserve before going."
"for my mother in law’s birthday, we went to porto maurizio in heythuysen. we arrived at 18:15 and got our starter around 18:45. the three of us ordered pizza (not too difficult to prepare), but it took the chefs more than one hour and 25 minutes to get out pizza’s out on our table. the pizza tasted okay, but i’ve had better at porto maurizio’s. if you ask me now, i’m in doubt if i will come and eat here again."
"this is a great place on the boarder of the netherlands and germany, with an excellent selection of ice creams (my favourites - the spaghetti ice in different versions) and coffees. friendly personnel."
i had a decent italian meal..fro. the portion to the taste it was pure italian. the service was quick and friendly. good view in the calm vaals..and they do home delivery
"we stayed for 1 night in hotel bilderberg. their restaurant was full so we had to look for something else. we went to della mamma. nice cousy italian restaurant. the staff is very friendly. we ordered carpaccio and pasta. all was good. if you look more for a fancy italian then this is not the place, but for pizza, pasta nice cousy place it is."
"not a bad pizza for dutch standards, but clearly no wood fired stone oven stuff. tiramisu was quick good. nice garden seating at the back. service was ok."
we started with lovely crackers and a drink. and we ended with that.  from all the pictures we saw on line the food looked delicious. insensitive to dietary requirements. apart from that - sadly a bad attitude and unpleasant.
we love good food cooked well in combination with a good atmosphere. the first bit perfect the rest utter pants. you dont pay a small fortune to get treated like scum. its such a shame that such a good chef is stuck with a horrible wait 
"have to say due to all the rewards ,stuck as stickers to the window, you know it should be good. food wise we were not disappointed but price wise it was just too much for what you got, especially in this region. tiny oysters (with very nice finishes) a good main, all cooked to a good/high standard decent wines. all in all ok but the owner is an acquired taste, if youve ever been to tuscany youll be fine there."
"all started out ok. the food was ok. however the service was slow. we had to get up and ask for the food menus, bill and get up and pay due to lack of attention by the waiter. then the card reader would not work. the waiter told us this has been happening for over a week. no one told us when we arrived. they didn’t seem to care. won’t be returning."
"one of the worst italian restaurant on earth ! poor service, bad food, horrible pizz "
"we were at albertos when it had opened for two / three months. the food was ok, price slightly high. service was clearly inexperienced. we had to wait to long for our drinks and food."
located in a small town in friesland right on a little river. this italian restaurant offers typical dishes like pasta and piz 
a fine italian restaurant. do not expect haute cuisine. but thats fine. just a no-nonsense italian restaurant. with surprising dishes and pizzas
this is a nice little restaurant with friendly staff and a good menu. i have been several times and it is always busy and has a nice buzz about the place. the food is your basic standard italian but is all done nicely.
"dropped in for a meal and it was fine, nothing really stood out but would visit again if in the area"
"we enjoyed our simple italian meal in this very convenient restaurant for the return ferry to harwich. however, we were stunned to be charged 9 euros for a bottle of still water. the bill was first marked up as 7 euros and then changed to 9. when we queried it we were told water is expensive in holland. its not."
pizzas are expensive here so my expectations were high. at least that a pizza is enough for a complete me 
really rude ! 
"friendly staff, but they never came to check on us to ask how the food was or to check if we needed more drinks. missed chance! the food was tasty, but oh, so very slow... too bad!"
"1. on arriving we were pressed for a drink order and not knowing what we yet wanted simply asked for plain table water while we decided. of course they delivered over priced bottled water. when we responded that if we had to pay for something, it would be something we wanted. the waitress, rather than being polite was haughty and arroge "
"the way these guys are treating there customers is the worst i’ve ever seen in europe! we came 20 minutes before 9 pm, just want to have beer, coffee and desserts. they did not tell us about the rule, we’ve been waiting for 15 minutes, after our question at 2055 they told a us that we still need to wait! full ‘flexibility’ is there seems! then at 2105 the manager came to our table - i’ve asked her very politely not to ruin the evening for the people close by and speak inside. but she insisting on talking at the spot and we’ve been talking for another 15 minutes, rather then just receiving the ord "
if you want to enjoy a good italian pizza go to la terrazza. the service is ok and the prices are average for bergen.its location is right in the center of the village and easy to find.
"everything here is so-so. because of their prime location, the incentive to try harder apparently lacks. has been a few months since i visited so maybe its different now #benefitofthedoubt"
what we experienced in this restaurant is beyond any acceptable level. until our presence had been noticed i took already quite a while. the drinks took as long as in a normal restaurant the food does. after about forty minutes since ordering a wrong salad came. usually the personel would say sorry and look that everrhing goes smoothly from that point. instead we kept on waiting. after our wish to pay the drinks and go we got a promise that our food comes within a minute. the tomato salad then came. after that was eaten up the pizzas were still missing. in my entire life i never had to leave a restaurant due to such a bad service. montagne was my premiere in that matt 
"went here with mr. husband and little one (2yo). we were early (5pm) which ment that we were the only ones there. had to eat outside as inside was too hot after a recent heat wave, but the outside dining area is directly next to the main road through town, so it is very busy and little one could not walk around. also two servers were continously standing in the doorway watching us. i can understand they want to see whether someone else comes in but i felt very watched. they spoke italian to each other. on the one hand i like an italian restaurant ran by italians, on the other hand i like to understand what the ones watching me are saying "
"the orgininal italian disches are freshly prepared, with fine ingredients. the preparation time from order to actual eating, takes a while, in which too much emphasis is on wine sales..."
"the place is nice and cosy, and the people are very nice and friendl "
we were 3 adults and two small kids who all had pizza. it was tasty but nothing out of the ordinar 
"we love the food here, everything is beautifully made and presented so has an amazing kitchen. it’s a little on the pricy side here for it’s location. staff are good but always seem very serious so come across very frosty. we must have been there about 30 times last year and we still don’t raise much of a smile from the staff - maybe they hate us! ;)"
"we went there on a saturday evening to have a small dinner. the restaurant appears to be a snack bar with some tables. we ordered steaks, which were very very tough and way overcooked. the spaghetti carbonara was uneatable salty. the sharma was to salty and too much."
"the food was acceptable. i have only taken food out with this restaurant, and it was so so. the pizza that i ordered was not what i was expecting, and it was soggy by the time i got home (10 min drive). i would not be eating here again."
"the food was quite okay. the hostess, nonna, is wonderfully charming. the reason for a terrible rating is that we asked for 2 simple glasses of water for our 2 thirsty boys and were presented for expensive bottled mineral water. the waitress forgot to mention they refuse to serve tapwater. that was her mistake. what angers me is the policy of refusal of tap water. bottled water is pollution for it is carried from afar whilst excellent dutch tap water isnt. and why? because centerparcs wants to squeeze you for every buck in your pocket and doesnt give anything about our childrens future environment. so please stop advertising how much action you take for being green. it is just another one of your custumor luring schemes."
terrible at best. we waited over an hour for food. carbonara was covered in spring onions... they made another for us but it was bland and gloopy. salmon pasta was the same sauce with smoked salmon on top. ive had far better microwave meals. lasagne was ok. the only saving grace was our waitress who was lovely and clearly embarrassed. we could hear all the tables around us complaining... pizza which you could barely cut through. extortionately priced for the quality.
"organizational skills are hardly up to par. antipasta was served ages before getting our first drinks. pizzas were ok, but the pasta was, besides only being able to opt for penne (which is highly unlikely as pasta for bolognaise), extremely boring and had too little salmon to even mention it a salmon sauce. tasteless and no pepper on the table to spice it up. dessert time was no more satisfying than the prior experiences: the dame blanche could hardly be called a db, the kids cocktail was simple an alcohol-free fizzy drink, the bourbon was served in a gin glass that couldnt fit the ice cube and the aperol was so watery that i am hydrated for the next coming days. wish we would have read the reviews beforehand. this cannot be called an italian restaurant if restaurant at all!"
"we had wait for 20 minutes before anyone came to even take our order and then they got out first order wrong. we took two kids 3-course, a lasagna and another main course and salad. the food was ok without being good. for the kids desert tiramisu there were ice crystals in the ice cream, so either was an old ice cream or not properly stored. all in all, average food and average service in a park where food options are limited"
"it took over an hour for 1 pizza and 2 daily simple pasta dishes to arrive. no apologies from the staff who seemed to prefer to stand and chat to each other rather than serve the customers. our waitress asked us 3 times if we’d ordered - the answer was yes every time and surely when you only have 2 tables to cover you can remember that you’d been and asked us twice before?!finally gave them an ultimatum that if our food didn’t arrive in the next 5 mins we were leaving, it miraculously appeared. bolognaise was dreadful and the tagliatelle was very undercooked. will definitely not be returning during our stay and it has put us off the other restaurants at center parcs port zélande."
1 pizza + 1 pasta 4 cheeses took more than one hour to arrive and it was overcooked... nonna came to see us at the beginning but never came bac 
food took over an hour to arrive and when it did we had to eat separately as the meals arrived at different times. the order had also been taken incorrectly and we were given a kiddies tomatoe pasta instead of an adults bolognaise. the waiter refused to change the orde 
"the food was horrible and ridiculously overpriced  service was bad too, we waited for more than an hour for very basic dishes.a real disappointment"
"i want to review this place in all fairness so let me start by saying i had a very nice pasta meal at this restaurant. then i ordered a take away pizza and the cheese was a bit salty; definitely not the mozzarella which is traditionally used for most real italian pizza. i went in for another take away pizza and asked them if they could use mozzarella; the owner informed me all pizza is made with gouda 48+ cheese and that they’ve been doing it for 40 years. that put me off. if you don’t care about truly traditional authentic italian pizza i guess it’s ok as a dutch cheese pie dish but for me it’s a big no no, especially as on its website the restaurant claims to serve authentic/traditional italian cuisine. obviously, dutch gouda cheese is not used in authentic italian cuisine as far as i know."
"we heard there was glutenvrij opties here. so we headed over there, around 5p. well, the food took over an hour to come out and if we didnt ask where our food was, we would still be waiting. i feel they overbooked and could not handle all the orders that night. they definitely forgot about us, my two young daughters were starving, not nice. i had to find a waiter for drinks, unreal. anyway, the food eventually came out. i had a glutenvrij pizza. it was absolutely horrific! just being honest. i usually eat or finish anything that is put in front of me. but this is the first time in my life, that i could not even come close to finishing a dinner. it tasted so horrific, and overwhelmingly salty, i couldnt believe they actually brought this out. it was like a salt pizza. i was so embarrassed for them and couldnt bare to tell them. i know we complained and they did something for us, maybe we didnt pay, dont remember. this occurred last year sometime. i will never go back. my wifes food was just not the best either. not a good night out."
"we were both disappointed. nothing felt like it has just been made. everything had the taste and texture of bought food heated and plated. the cheese sauce was awful; sorry, but it was. the soup was definitely more put together than made, and soup isnt difficult. we would not go there again."
i heard good opinions but found myself disappointed. we ordered focaccia e pane - we got regular bread /not a focacc 
"the food was absolutely fabulous, but the staff are just rude and unfriendly; no idea how to be good hosts; its a shame as it takes away from the excellent food thats being served; will not be going back because of the staff"
"now and than we order for take-out, in general acceptable quality, not top class. the last time it was really not worth the money, far too expensive, 2 simple pizzas for € 24.50"
"tried this place more than once. the food is decent but priced three levels above the quality offered. wine selection is good, but overpriced. service suggests star level performance that doesnt materialize. limited parking. seating outside is nice though."
not easy to find and parking can be a hassle. nicely located on a wooded corner. sit outside or in. friendly service and good upper class food. not very imaginative and a bit boring. extensive wine list. but on the high side in pricing for what it offers certainly if you have a few glasses. 
"i went there recently and ordered a vegetarian dish because i am vegetarian for 10 years. they brought me a pasta that i was supposed should have bbq vegi chicken, i started to eat and i feel this vegi chicken is very similar to real one, tola my friend their product is as similar as real chicken but ask my friend to test it and she told no i think it is the real chicken, i was shocked , the worst answer that i expected,i asked the staff to check my dish and he told sorry we made a mistake!? just sorry ?!and the funny and awful response of them offering me a coupon for a dessert??!! what they think?! i was in a bad mood mentally and physically but i think the first option should change my food and make new one but when i rejected the dessert offer ,they just put 14 euro on my table and collect the food of my friend also , she was between of her dish, it seems they just want us to leave the restaurant and don’t say anything about they fault! it is so unprofessional and offensive behavior of their staff! i don’t want to go there anymore and tell to all of my friends to don’t go there. i don’t suggest there at all!!!"
"tried happy italy in schiedam. and wow, horrendous. i ordered a pasta carbonara and a pizza with chicken, paprika and red onion. the chicken on the pizza was of the lowest possible quality and had no taste at all. i wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to anyone."

"visited with friends after an escape room on a friday night. place was packed,service a bit long.we were 25 mins late but they waited for us,which was nice. my pasta carbonara was overly greasy,with bad quality pancetta. the rest of my group had different pizze,no one was really amazed by any of  "
"everything o.k., however nothing outstanding. so for a simple, straight forward meal well recommended. the interior of the restaurant is very original!"
good location - 9/10 nice ambiance - 7/10 friendly staff - 7/10 average food quality - 5/10 value - 7/10 expected a better quality of food
"had to wait over an hour and a half for a simple pizza, apparently because a risotto was dropped of one of my party. no apologies.  risotto was pretty mediocre, pizza okay."
"we decided to have our christmas dinner at restaurant de olifant in breukelen. we searched for multiple venues in the region and went with de olifant after having read the positive reviews online, despite the fact that it was on the more expensive end of the set we looked  "
"we went to this place because it was mentioned that they cook italian cuisine. the place is nice, the surrounding is beautiful (at the river vecht), the service was fine. however, the food was ok, it only reminds me far away what the taste would have been if the restaurant was located in italy. making italian food with a dutch swing, is a pity."
"i have eaten here before and it was lovely, not this time. we went for the shared dining and had a discount as well, maybe that is why. the bread and dips were great. the starter had good variation. there were mussels, cooked too long and calimari that were way too salty. there was a tomato salad with no flavor at all, but the piece of smoked mozzerlla was divine. the sauteed mushrooms were very nice. the rest of the table had some ham and vitello tonato(made with fricandau instead of veal) but i have a pork allergy, so i had a bruschetta with carpaccio, very tasty. it took a long time for the nect course to come and drinks were not refreshed. when the main course arrived, we were given the wine menu, as asked for. the cod and risotto was quite good, but the other course was pork and vegetables. i got some vegetables, and the sauce was so salty, it was inedible. the wine order was not taken. finally, after another long wait, dessert, again lots of choice. some ice-cream, nothing wrong with that. tje creme brulee and tiramisu were extremely bland. the chocolate mousse was nice, and the topping on the panna cotta was superb, but the basis tasted only of sweet. another long wait for the coffee, one of us received a cappuccino imstead of a latte and none of the coffee was very good. i really hope this was just a bad day, and not an indication that the quality is declining. "
"location is superb. ample parking. food sizes are european and more than enough when you dont want to overeat. service was friendly. tastes were fine. desert was to die for. and then again... this could be so much better if someone with knowledge of interior decoration could do over this place. the colors on the wall, floors, furniture, signs, lighting fixtures, curtain rails, bathrooms, ... it is eclectic and not warm. missed opportunity to make the look and feel of the place in sync with the aspiration on the culinary field and service. this makes the price/quality poor."
"while on a visit to our daughter, in breukelen, we dined at de olifant. what a disappointme "
"the food is horrible! you think that it would be good because its got 4.4 stars on google, but its disgusting. we ordered a minestrone soup and a four cheese pizza and were disgusted about how they turned out. the minestrone soup was just broth, not a soup. the four cheese pizza tasted like boiled plastic. overall, the food tasted very bad, and tasted more mediterranean than italian. do not trust the rating!"
"we ordered a pizza, calamari, and parmigiana. all three dishes were absolutely not tasty. calamari was so over-fried and tasteless that we send them back. the pizza bread was good but the topping tasted awful. the same for parmigiana - no parmesan, few pieces of eggplant and tomatoes, and lots of cheap chee "
"at around 8pm on friday (29-03-2019) night we wanted to have some dessert and a drink. we went into the restaurant and the manager told us that they didnt have any vacant tables. when i looked around and pointed at several vacant tables, he told us that the kitchen was closed (at 8pm! really?). their desserts were on display in the vitrine, so i told him that they dont need the kitchen to serve us desserts and drinks. nevertheless, he refused to sit us without giving a proper reason. all he said is that he had to stop somewhere (whatever it means). we live close by, so we could be regular customers in that place, but there is no way that we will ever go there again. the way they treat customers is disgusting. also, a couple of times we had ordered a pizza to go there, which was just average."
"we have a last minute diner and we decided to this at this restaurant. the staff helped us correctly, which was very nice. however, they have asked us only once for drinks. the customer service should be better. pizza was very tasteful but my salmon was over cooked. and it wasn’t seasoned correctly. i couldn’t give them a tip because my overall experience was too low unfortunately. next time better, i hope. "
had dinner last week with some colleagues.  pasta was perfectly ok but nothing amazing.   the restaurant is comfortable & spacious.   portions are a good size.
"we were there 3 times. first time everything was perfect - food and service.so we came back .second time we ordered the same things like on the first time ; entrecote with patatoes and warm( caramelised) vegetables and lasagne,and tea( very good tea and a lot of flavor too choose) , and here we go "
we went there as a group of 4 friends; we took a starter a main course dessert beers bottle of wine and expres 
"i don’t think i’ll be back any time soon, the pistacho pesto pasta was bland and slightly uncooked; clearly prepared by someone who doesn’t have a passion for food.. the pizza was ok: crunchy crust but slightly salty, nothing special. staff was kind but inexperienced."
"we visited with hubby and little one, when my mom visited from greece. we know italian food and were not delighted with what they served but neither disappointed. some of the plates were good and some were blah! waiter was very friendly. wine lovely. kids friendly too. not bad for an afternoon after shipping when you havent got any time to cook ;)"
the food is nothing special and quite honestly the pizza tastes like it was a frozen pizza and the pasta was bland. i wouldnt recommend this place at all.
"spent an evening here with colleagues. we were a group of 6, and arrived at around 19:00. service is friendly, and the atmosphere is nice. the speed of service however, isnt amazing. we received our starters around 21:00, and our main course around 21:30. one of our collegues unfortunately had to leave before his main course arrived, he hadnt expected to have to wait close to two hours for his fo "
"the atmosphere is nice and the service friendly. the food is average, at least what we had. we had a pizza (ive really tried better pizzas before), cannelloni (at least average), tuna filet (not bad) and a beef filet with pepper sauce (not bad)."
"under new management for about three years now, the restaurant now offers good italian food sicilian style (rather than northern italian, from where the former owner originated). pleasant atmosphere; nice view of the old rijswijk church from the window tables and terrace, the restaurant is currently also open for lunch. "
"upscale italian restaurant with italian owner who gives a lot of attention to his guests. fairly long wait times for the food, expect to spend the better part of an evening. good wines. the menu looks very interesting, but i have to say the taste of teh food was rather average, on the bland side. no real taste surprises. "
"we ordered 6 pizzas, and they were not good at all. the dough was very dry and the toppings were very scanty. moreover, it took them over 1.5 hours to get to us (2 km away). i would definitely not recommend this venue."
"ordered here using the just eat website. we ordered a big hawai pizza and a medium chicken pizza. service was fast, pizzas arrived within 20 minutes. the hawai pizza was not so special, the chicken shoarma pizza was very nice though, very tasty with the garlic sauce. prive was 22 euros. maybe i would eat the chicken pizza someday but im not sure if i would try this place again. the website is by the way fellinispizzarijswijk.nl"
"the food is ok, but the place needs a facelift and the service is terrible. they forgot our drinks order several times! this place is not really recommendable…"
not much to say here. on my quest to find a decent delivery pizza in the hague this ranks straight to the bottom. probably the worse pizza i ve ever had
pizza dough is strange.. its kind of gummy. i took the new york pizza because i wanted to try something different. id youre looking for an italian pizza stay away from this place. imo prices are a bit high for the size of the pizza.
"me and my girlfriend went there to have a nice italian meal. a trattoria typically push on a condensed menu with high quality raw materials, here instead there was everything (including pizza) and low quality. we took an home appetizer to share: fried squids + mushrooms + prosciutto and salami + carpaccio and roastbeef. all in one dish fish and meat, really no sense. salami were really low quality and high margin products. then we ordered gnocchi alla sorrentina which were overwhelming of garlic and rigatoni salciccia e funghi with super liquid cream and parsley, i had acidity after few minutes. then we ordered a seabass, which was ok, and ossobuco which was good but with a ragu really acid. service was below par but justifiable by the fact that they were all very young and unexperienced (f.i. forks and knife posed on the table with no napkin). the place itself is decent with a nice terrace but food is really bad"
"pizzas was not dry and tasteless. all in family had different pizzas, only one was decent. in addition the wait for the food was very long."
i have been to many italian pizzas but rarely have i had such a disgusting pasta as this one. pasta from a pack which had barely been cooked served with a mushroom sauce from a pack. my partners pizza was less disgusting but still pretty bad. will never come back.
"we thought we would spend the last night of our holiday at somewhere special, what an error! the decor and ambiance is fine, thats where it ends.20 minutes after we arrived we managed to order 4 starters, only 3 turned up, had to reorder. we chased the staff to order wine, the montepulciano was not available i asked for the waitress advice on an equivalent dont know dont drink red she sa "
"we ordered pizzas to go. it took nearly an hour to have them ready when the restaurant was almost empty and the waiter was not particularly friendly.  the pizzas were good, but i dont think well come back. i wish them good luck."
"we were there on a friday night, the worst night for parking as they are setting up the saturday market stal "
"besides the nice settings and location, the food and service were absolutely horrible!! the hostess was extremely rude and the waitresses were very inexperienced. the food was even worse. we ordered veal escalope with white wine & lemon dressing and it was not even remote to what we expected. the dry and tough meat was nasty and they gave us a separate plate with extremely dry and overcooked vegetables. well, not even a decent plate of food, but more like 2 pieces of broccoli, 3 disgusting potatoes and a piece of mango on the side. the portions were also very very sma "

"the food was quite nice but not amazingly good. it lacked a bit of flair in the way its being presented and how the plates are made up. the place is nicely decorated and looks very stylish, open doors to the kitchen (noise and strong neon light) are not good.. the place the restaurant is located in has a lingering sewer problem that also the new owner has not yet repaired, the result is a slight smell in the restaura "
"pizza was nice, thin and crispy. but seafood spagetti was not fresh and too much garlic, not to my like."
"doppio espresso is situated in the covered shopping center koningshoek in maassluis. this shopping center has the advantage of all weather shopping and lots and lots of free parking. doppio espresso has an inviting appearance with tables inside and outside in the wide passage. not unexpected through the name of the establishment italian food and drinks are offered and efforts are made to create an italian atmosphere. i settled for a common black coffee, because i didnt want to experience the disappointment of an inadequate espresso and it was too late for a cappuccino. cannoli were on offer and i couldnt resist ordering one. the cannolo was better than expected, but the envelope was a bit hard. generally a good effort was made by the staff to create an italian atmosphere, but unfortunately the eye watering prices were very un- italian. a three point rating."
"i always order delivery for this bussiness. from all the orders throughout the year. i think there has only been one order that was delivered with all the add ons as i ordered. i thought after two months or so, i give it another try. i never posted a review.today was the last straw, the two pizzas i ordered one was correct. the second pizza was once again not the one i ordered, a conpletely different one. i contacted the company: i requested the correct pizza for free this time, maybe not to friendly. they did not agree to that since they have no registration of the previous incorrect orders, despite them once having given me a free order after an earlier debacle. might be because i order without an account. a dessert was offered, i refused that. now i got the correct order, however still with a spice i specified not to add. once you get the pizza the quality is good, but okay considering pricing. for me this was the straw that broke the camels back for the delivery option. i dont know if they give the wrong order to the delivery person or that it already goes wrong when reading the order.i am just one customer, but how unlucky can you get? i used to recommend this pizzeria to friends and family, but i will no longer do so."
"pizzas are excellent. atmosphere is fine, seeing the wood oven is nice. air quality inside is poor, the space is also noisy, hard to hear each other in a group of s "
very bad and aggressive owner !!!! bad food and sour peppers 🌶  and he got mad because if it crazy never seen this before!
"we were looking for a place to eat after visiting the local museum and were pointed to this place. its a small, but cozy restaurant and we ordered pizzas, tortellini and spaghetti. we shared two caprese salads. service was friendly and the house wine was good. the pizza i had (formaggi) was exactly how it is supposed to be: crunchy and thin with different kinds of fresh cheese. we couldnt resist the desserts (home made tiramisu, a chocolate dessert and two dona biancas) and they were definitely worth the calories! we finished with espressos and were offered a limoncello of the house: excellent! recommended!"
"cucina elena is located in vleuten, very close to vleuten train station. this is not a place for tourists but for locals who are either regulars or candidates to be regulars. we arrived at cucina at 17:35-17.40 and ordered 2 pizzas. we got our pizzas at 18:00. for a place which only has 4 tables inside (1 of them was empty when we ordered), this is really really long. the place is quite small so on a cold day, it might be chaotic with all the people who wait inside and there is no place to move, also for the staff. we arrived home and the pizzas are already got half-cold (we traveled by car for 6 minutes) . the crust around the pizza was so hard it was breaking and hurting your mouth when you bite. last but not least, according to the quattro formaggi description, i was expecting to taste gorgonzola which i did not at all. actually all i could taste was simple cheese "
nice restaurant to go to with your children and family. good italian food. easy close by parking. saturday live music and lively atmosphere.
the place located by the shopping center in vleute 
"this location (maarssen) did not answer the phone, twice. then tried to order online. in my basket each pizza is suddenly €1.50 more expensive than listed. then tried calling the paid number. it asked my zip code to then bluntly tell me there is no location near me (seriously?) and hung up on me. congratulations with the worst customer service experience we had in a long time.

"we were recommended this place and were disappointed. pizza (margherita) was mediocre at best, and wasnt cheap too. some slices didnt have any cheese on them, just tomato sauce."
ordered a pizza with tuna. bottem was very soft and the topping poorly. tomato sauce tasted very artificial. something from a jar. asked for garlic on my pizza. they dont have that. rather strange for a pizzeria.

"dirty tables, very slack service and a few of the courses featuring on the menu where not available, such as the small pizza. seems this could not be made, only the large version ? quite incomprehensable. however worst thing was getting sick later that evening with all the symptoms of food poisoning.not recommended"
"first of all, food was great. service took a while but didn’t affect the mood too much. would’ve given a 5 purely for the pizza! perfect mix of mushroom and spinach proper got my taste buds going. this good feeling was rapidly destroyed when we went to pay and encountered mutton chops(man behind the till). if you’re not familiar with the term then google it. he was very rude. laughed at me because i’m english. stared at me for quite some time without saying a word. mutton chops, if you’re reading this then you really need to sort out your attitud "
"we waited patiently for at least 20 minutes in front of the counter but were totally ignored by the staff walking back and forth numerous times. no hellos, how many people do you have etc. nothing. not even eye contact was made with us. they then inexplicably proceeded to serve people who arrived later than us. needless to say that we left without eating as the arrogant service shown by the staff shows that this restaurant is not worth our time and money."
"not quite sure if they have a shortage of menu cards, but when we asked for one, we were told to ask the people at another table for one!! the restaurant was almost full inside and very hot and smelt very fishy, so outside it was, luckily it warmed up and it was pleasant to sit there.when we finally got hold of a menu, and ordered, the food was good. my husband had lasagne, my friend, scampi in garlic butter, and mine was a delicious goat cheese salad. the food was very good, the service a bit less, but maybe they just had too much work. we intended staying for dessert, and once again asked for a menu, as there were none around, but that did seem to be a problem, so when no menu arrived, we decided just to get the bill instead and left."
"we were looking precisely for a good italian resto in sluis and mineral had best marks on tripadvisor. it looked pretty good at the beginning and was full of people (most ordering pizza). in fact, we got self made sparkling water (6,5 euro/bottle.. ); tomato soup was a disaster (too hot, with too much salt and huge pieces of tomatoes - obviously from cane); pasta was ok (i would give 6 points from 10); but service made it all.. young lady who served us was tired and definitely not interested in tips, she simply picked the order, delivered food without any word, ignored coffee and bill (though she confirmed the order, we never received our espresso and i had to go to the bar to pay dinner myself). nothing to be added, we will not come back. "

"ordered “kip pikant” at the office we noticed that the chicken was smelling strange (sour)... we returned to the shop and complained. no real excuse was given, only some other sandwiches were given in return "
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of €17,-. fries cost €6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
i had high hopes for this place after reading reviews and looking at the photos on the websit 
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"a family italian restaurant, not so bad. food was ok, but the place is really oldated. prices are reasonable"
"ok. pizza is sick and soggy and very salty. parmigiana was very disappointed , aubergine was no fried, like a water🙈 no fresh herbs, without fresh basilicum it is not a real deal.. most of the dinner went to the garbage.. we had a bad tummy in a half hour.. shame… not anymore "
"we had dinner with friends. i found this to be a nice place, but i found the food to be average. service was good, the limoncello was not as it should (it was made with vodka) and the feeling in the dinning area is that you are in an old restaurant needing a rebuilt to give it a fresh look. you will not be disappointed if you eat there, but you wont be excited either."
"bad service, terrible pizza, expensive .  pizza dough was either burnt or soggy. the air spray was so overwhelming that even the water tasted of it. very expensive for very very bad pizza and terrible service."
"first visit to this restaurant and a little bit disappointed despite the fact that the waitresses were nice. our entree/amuse was forgotten (!); you dont aks for it, though. the service was slow. the terderloin, i ordered was indeed from the grill but, in the middle red and absolutely not medium cooked. i mentioned it, but it was too late to be returned to the chef (which i understood). as a compensation i was offered a free drink, which was nice though. my partner had the tagliatelli with sea fruits. that was nice!."
opening hours not accurate. it states this restaurant is open to 21:45. we arrived around 20:40 and they said they were closed. very disappointing but on the positive side we then stumbled across groucho’s which was amazing and serves food till late! we arrived well after 21:00 and made very welcome by all staff. we’ll be back!

"just another fast food place with forgettable food.not much good to say about it, limited drinks selection."
"the food although pricey was good. the drinks , to expencive.  at least offer an affordable choice.  because no carbohydrate side dish  we left hungry"
"i ordered the lasagna with a yoghurt and granola dessert along with a small latte. the lady at the till decided to charge me an extra 20 cents for a syrup in my coffee which i never asked for. the dining area was disgustingly filthy with dirty tables, uncleared finished meals and overflowing bins. dear me mr oliver. what have you put your name on here! i wanted to eat here instead of just going to mcdonalds all the time. next time ill stick to maccy ds!!"
"schiphol is lacking in proper food, just overpriced bread rolls with cheap filling. i decided to give this place a chance. the lasagne was cold, lacking in taste, and substance, just creamy mush. the tomato soup was far too overspiced, and im saying that as someone that enjoys spice. the cappuccino is effectively warm milk without any coffee taste, same as everywhere else in this airport. the price is extortionate. dont bother. in euros soup €5.50, lasagne €12.25. bottle of water €5, cappuccino €5. o yeah and paper plates and cutlery. "
"disgusting and chaotic. the simple order of sandwich and coffee was incorrectly delivered, it too ages to pay even though there was no queue, and the food was terrible. never again, a complete waste of money. jamie, get this place fixed or take your name off the door."
jamie oliver should be ashamed to have his name associated with this restaurant. the quality of the food is very poor
"food was cold, although the staff were ok. wished i’d gone to mcdonalds least it might have been hot food."
"shocking set up, incredibly slow service and rude sullen staff, who don’t seem to know how to make coffee. if you want hot food - good luck. queue for your food then queue for your drink and to pay. by the time you’ve got to the till your meal will be cold. macdonalds is probably nicer"
horrible. don’t ever come here absolutely shocking! food was horrible and the prices were appalling. wish i read the reviews first. you might as well go and get a mcdonald’s over this because it was just horrible. avoid this place at all cost.
honestly a terrible experience almost from start to fini 
"it says full breakfast... not sure what style? apparently its meant to feel familiar, but i paid the best part of £20 for watery dry beans, a solid sasauge and for some reason, there are new potatoes on my plate. spoons breakfast is better than jamie olivers by a country mile. yuck."
"avoid at all costs, food uneatable. didn’t touch it and staff demanded i paid for food that was shocking. so called woman chef was rude, threw the food at me and told me i didn’t pay when u did pay a shocking €30 for something we didn’t eat. this place needs a reality check as it’s customer service is shocking. don’t waste your money and go to mcdonald’s. very rubbish end to a good trip"
this restaurant was appalling. when i complained the staff laughed in my face. don’t go here as you definitely chance feeling sick afterwards as i did
"awful, awful food, slow service and hugely expensive. avoid. the vegetarian breakfast had some kind of clear sauce on it so the whole thing was swimming. actually made my daughter wretch. the mean one my other daughter had was not better - she said it was the worst sausage she had ever had. no porridge. dry bacon butty. jamies face smiling and saying he had good food for us, we wanted to be set up for the flight and ended up hungry and ripped off."
shocking service staff aloof at the tills and the food was practically inedible. it sounded great on menu but it’s not when it comes to your paper box. 4.15 for a soft drink bottle at least 50% more expensive than in the other already price inflated stores. they capitalise on their position being the first restaurant through the gate and clearly don’t feel the need to provide a service or product that justifies the price.
"do not eat here! there are many other places in schipol airport that will provide you with a decent meal. you will not get one here we ordered the veggie breakfast and they were missing ingredients from the breakfast such as the potatoes, it was luke warm and you are served in what i can only describe as cardboard dogbowl. and the bill was €35 for food that i can only describe as slop in a bowl! "
"shockingly overpriced, poor service and tables not clean. ordered the woodman’s sandwich, which was missing ingredients."
"waited ages to be served with food, as soon as i walked away a taller male was served, took my food to pay and get a drink, 3 people there but only 1 till on 2 iced coffees only 1 had ice, by the time i got to my table the food was cold, surprised at the 2* rating."
"absolutely disgusting here. lots of staff doing nothing while all tables are filthy, broken glass and generally disgusting. we even saw a mouse running around!!!"
so bad it’s laughable - except then you realise how much you paid for inedible food.  wish i had read the reviews first - they are all accurate.  this place needs to be closed
jamie. seriously.  16.95 euros for a tiny portion of cold gnocchi and a bottle of water. and you are putting your name to this. i’d be embarrassed
overpriced and not very efficient for a location that demands quick service.   slack about cleaning tables.
"had nicoise salad and a piece of pizza- both completely inedible. pizza a dry and stale. lettuce in salad was brown and slimy. took them both back up to the counter. the server was very unhelpful and said they couldn’t do anything. i asked for a refund and they questioned the fact that i had had a bite out of the pizza. i explained ‘yes that’s how i knew it was stale and dry!’ the server begrudgingly refunded my money, no apology at all. i have never left a negative review before and i never take food back unless completely inedible. can’t believe jamie oliver puts his name to this! "
"over priced, poor food and shocking services. 22.55 for a small breakfast coffee and water. the so called chef weighed out my spoon of egg. my advice stay clear and there’s better places to eat in the airport. what a complete rip-off jamie. you should be ashamed of yourself"
"total slop masquerading is an italian pasta dish.  no flavour, over cooked and essentially cold.  total brand distraction for mr oliver."
"everything about this place is awful, queued for 30 mins to find how dry and unappetising the hot breakfast was. opted for a sausage sandwich, e7.50, it was 1 sausage sliced into 3, in a completely dry bun, asked for butter or sauce and the staff said they had none at all and offered me jam. queued another 10 mins to pay so the sandwich was cold by the time i sat down. avoid at all costs. cannot believe this is trading."
"a few slices of dried up pizza alongside some dried up pasta was all they had. nothing else, no lasagna, not even any sparkling water. jamie should be ashamed."
"absolutely dreadful food! dry, bearly toasted cheese and ham toastie that cost e5 plus …. best of a bad choice … sadly, avoid !  however … highly recommend starbucks near gate h , fabulous sandwiches and cheaper  🙌"
"terrible in all respects. dirty table and floor. ridiculous queueing system meant that on getting to the front of the long line i was told that i had to order hot food a different counter, so that by the time i had queued again and gone back to the till the food was cold. breakfast “sandwich” was disgusting and the coffee tasted like dish water."
would not come back - family of 3 was 40 euros for cold food - not the quality expected at all :( still starving 🥹 first bad meal we have had in holland
really unpleasant breakfast - trying to be high end and charging high end prices but done terribly. rock hard sausage with cubes of scrambled egg with some crusty rosemary thrown on in an attempt to justify the price.
awful breakfast in a bowl. long wait to pay by which time poor quality food was cold.  dont have  high expectations for airport food but for 45 euro expect it to be edible. had a better breakfast out a tin
"absolutely disappointing. we went there as we both like jamie‘s dishes. but what you get there is a bad joke. pasta that tastes like nothing, pizza that is only oily. lots of stuff not on stock, employees highly unmotivated. better go downstairs to the „bread“ bar, here the food looked fresh and tasted as expected. "
we sewed the name and went i 
"paid €40 for food served in a cardboard bowl a teaspoon of scrambled egg, a sausage, rock hard bacon (ordered toast but didnt receive it) it was cold and looked awful. asked for the manager who couldnt be found so requested a refund. unbeknownst to me the table next to mine was also requesting a refund. our details were taken and i am still waiting 2 weeks later. cannot get hold of anyone to speak to and airport cannot help 🤷🏼‍ "
"the sausages are lovely but food so expensive charged for every item such as butter , sauces…. staff very slow and ignored us while they chatted among themselves"
"had a meal before flight home, medium bowl of mushroom pasta was bland, mushy and cost 8 euros, coke 5 euros, have had tastier pot noodles but was hungry so ate it, come on jamie, thought you were trying to get people to save money on food ! not this time"
prettt poor venue. staff not clearing table and left rubbish everywhere. half the food unavailable or looking like it had seen better days.
"my wife is a fan of jamie oliver and we was very excited to eat there. but the food was terrible without flavor. we order an aubergine parmigiano. the presentation was bad, but even worse the flavor. we also order a sandwich that was so simple. it was a very disappointing experience."
"only one member of staff to serve a queue of over twenty people. i joined with only four people ahead of me and that took twenty minutes. many people joined after. many people complaining of cold food as you have to collect your food first, then wait in a queue to pay. glad i only had coffee. once seated it was easy to see the tables had not been cleaned for hours and bins were overflowing. disgusting. wish i’d gone to starbucks. will never go to a jamie oliver again."
"terrible food quality. had the pasta bolognaise m, no flavour at all. taste like basic brand pasta sauce.  jamie oliver you should be ashamed to put your name to this place, but wealth and greed are the drives you more."
"terrible.  worse food ever.  no favour, tepid and soggy.  whole restaurant filthy with no one to clear tables.  would really avoid this restaurant at all cost."
has to be the wor 
"none of the tables were cleaned or cleared. customers had to clear tables themselves. the food is so basic, pasta (very plane) 2 choices of overpriced pizza, very tiny basic salads. bad coffee. i didn’t have a beer but they at least looked ok. there isn’t much choice of food in the airport but honestly mcdonalds would be better and 1/2 the price so just go there. jamie take your name off this shambles of a place or improve it!"
"absolute rip off for what it is, like microwaved pasta actually shop bought ones are nicer got lasagne just sheets of pasta no mince"
"can’t believe jamie oliver put his name to this restaurant. complete waste of money. really basic food, served badly."
"you would hope to get a decent feed when jamie oliver puts his name and face on a food outlet. i realise im in an airport, past security but still. "
"bad tempered staff, the worst, soggy bolognese pasta with no flavor at all! what does the name jamie oliver stand for? for the extortionate prices? money wasted, unfortunately :(("
mushroom pasta inedible- smelled and tasted like burnt garlic and cold by the time you have paid. same some years ago when it first opened but i had hoped for improvement- pity.
jamie oliver should be embarrassed having his name above the door. i had the mushroom pasta. no taste and the sauce was like water. also the pasta was over cooked. i expected so much more. what a let down jamie.
i had the misfortune to have a jamie’s deli breakfast yesterday morning at shiphol airpo 
"no one at the counter when i arrived, when called, refused to come to help me & a colleague came in his place. the ham & cheese toastie wasn’t great & the iced coffee was pretty dire. at 20 euro for those +a muffin & cappuccino, we were less than impressed"
"overpriced, pasta salad with no flavour. couldn’t even provide me with a wine glass for my overpriced wine. no staff cleaning tables. was forced to eat here as arrived in airport after 6 pm and unfortunately was the only option."
"at 17:30 they’d run out of some food. no trays, filthy tables, lacklustre staff apart from one kind soul who offered me her tray from behind the ba "
don’t waste your money here £3 for a measly 50gram of salad  we spent 24 euro on a coffee and two snacks  absolute joke jamie sort it out please!!!!!!!
"i visited jamie’s deli on sun 28th aug at 19-07 the queues were average i ordered pasta with mushrooms and a piece of margarita pizza the pasta came out of a new;y prepared dish in which i thought would be piping hot it wasn’t after queuing for almost ten minuets for a drink and to pay when i got to my table it was only aired there was only two staff on the counter taking payments serving coffee and drinks which was not enough,i think jamie oliver should visit his deli in disguise to sample the excuse for food and service i paid euros 29.70 with a drink i think if jamie oliver sees this review he should refund my money."
"this place is a disgraceful rip off, with shocking quality food & non-existent customer service. the breakfast €14.95 was all lumped into a bowl and did not include toast or tea/coffee/juice. they provided 4 slices of toast and charged us €16 extra - they would not provide more that 4 small butter servings. a small bottle of water was €5.10 & we were treated like criminals because they claimed we didn’t pay for 3 slices of toast. it’s disgraceful & embarrassing for jamie oliver to put his name to this. do not support this restaurant."
this was really poor. the food was really low quality and the aubergines were like eating rubber. really disappointing.
"alas the porridge, usually a safe bet for vegans, has cow’s milk in it. they offered to serve me the vegetarian breakfast without the eat but i was not in the mood for a heavy full english style breakfast. they do have non-dairy milks for tea and coffee."
"it’s the first thing you see when you enter the departure hall at schiphol. my advice: walk past  it and look for something good. it was quite disgusting. dirty trays, bad food, not very friendly. waste of money."
"€8 for one small piece of pizza that tastes like it has been sat out for an hour. service is terrible, staff look at you like you are inconveniencing them. avoid!"
"the gluten free options were very few and what was available was just poor, the staff although helpful didnt seem to know what was available. so i had to try to work it out for myself and have another salad lol i think jamie needs to have a look at this outlet and get a grip of things. the others in our group were only slightly less disappointed than i was."
food was terrible overpriced and service hopeless.  should have gone to mcdonalds next door.  trading on jamie’s name - jamie should disown this place.
jamie’s deli is directly opposite the exit from security. we arrived there at 1pm. lunchtime 
don’t waste your time or your money. the food is awful (like jamie oliver) and you have to be lucky to get a choice without having to wait 30 minutes.
a complete nightmare. by the time you have waited to pay your food it is cold. if you want to go back for a drink you have to wait another 30 mins.
"a total waste of my and my partners time. waited half an hour, with only one staff member on the tills doing the coffee and taking orders which was at 6 am which was the morning rush in the airpo "
"menus at entrance does not depict what they actually have. slowest line ever. 4 people behind the counter but apparently only one taking orders, taking money and making the coffee!!! very inefficient. we through out the iced coffee, the ham and cheese baguette had a pungent translucent onion we scrapped off .. other than that it was fine"
"visited several times recently, service is terrible, unhelpful staff and illogical queuing system, cold overpriced food by the time you actually pay for it. the place is beyond dirty, appears to not be cleaned throughout the day."
"im very disappointed with the whole experience at jamie oliver at schiphols airport. it has only the name. cold coffee, hard aubergine with wood cutlery which was impossible to cu "
avoid at all costs. dirty tables everywhere and staff chatting behind the corner. queried why my large coffee only filled 2/3rds of the cup and was told very rudely that it wasnt their problem. they then stood laughing. very unpleasant experience.
"awful. slow service, rude staff and messy, dirty trays and tables. avoid at all costs and someone please tell jamie to quit racking in the cash and spend more attention insuring anything with your name to it is up to standard"
"tables not cleared.  crumbs everywhere.  poor choice of food and what there was was poorly served.   people hogging tables; but not eating  jamie,jamie.  is this really what you envisioned…?"
"poor choice of food and honestly the pizza was terrible, very hard crust (probably old) and not so tasty. i would have expected more from a jamie franchise. would not recommend it"
"just terrible in every way. horri le food, miserable choice, inept staff, dirty. hard to fathom why this version of jamies franchises didnt also go bust, other than the absolute lack of choice in such a big airport (mcdonalds the only other at 1930 on a weekday...)"
"dirty, expensive and long waiting for a simple coffee. nobody comes around to check or clean the tables."
"o my goodness, that was the slowest service ever, 8 people working but you got feeling like is only 1 there, no one do anything. jamie for f..k sake its"
"oh dear . what a shocking disappointment- by the time the food on the paper plate was placed in front of me - it was luke warm at best. i seriously expected better than this. it was a toss up between them and their neighbours mcd- i thought that i would get better quality at jamie’s. sadly, i was so wro "
"only one thing actually offered on the menu and it was a gross, sloppy pasta. had to queue unnecessarily for over 15 mins which made the food cold. also was charged €5 for a bottle of water and the staff were rude. awful."
"overpriced, poor food selection, extremely dirty, uninterested slow staff and not at all tasting. i am no fan of mcdonald’s but in this case you should go for this instead which is right across."
"waited in queue for atleast 40 minutes, there were only four staff working, one making sandwiches, one cooking, one at payout and the fourth mostly just stood around doing nothing - time to time plating some foo "
"schipol is not great for dining at the best of times, but this is exceptionally bad. utter chaos, tables rarely cleared, uninterested staff, and terribly over priced. 11 euros for soggy, chewey pasta, 9 euros for some generic burnt carbohydrate (possibly pizza). a fitting end of the line to jamies restaurant empire. avoid at all costs"
"simply terrible by jamie oliver is what it should be called. the food for start is very over priced, if you manage to get over that fact the food is served while you are in the queue but the you have to wait while they make peoples coffees before you can pay and by that time our breakfast was now cold. they should have a designated pick up are for coffee/tea so they queue can keep moving. however the food is of a very poor standard. the sausage with the breakfast was extremely dry, why jamie oliver would want to put his name to this i do not know. go to mcdonald’s or something would even be a better choice than this."
skip th 
well what can i say..i had the lasagne...well it was left as it was dry and no meat and all pasta..no taste to it what so eve 
"sadly a big lie. promises all good stuff and no nasties but the hot breakfast was nasty and bad. scrambled egg looks like porridge and tastes nasty as does the sausage. to salty. the logistics also need work. prices are high what is no surprise, especially at an airpor "
for some reason loads of places were shut in schiphol when were travelling back so there wasnt much choice other than this or mcdonald 
chose this over mcdonalds (only other choice). pasta was cold & virtually inedible. salad was 2 spoonfuls & not great. pizza was even worse. total waste of money. beer was lovely & cold & only good thing about the experience! otherwise wouldnt even give it one star.
"there seemed to be only a choice of mcdonalds or here on the day so we opted for this thniking the food would be better. how wrong could we be? two dreadful, tastelesss small plates of mushroom pasta and a slice of horrible, burnt pizza. two tiny (200ml) orange juices, 11 euros for those. bottle of water at 4.95 euros. total just under 50 euros for the worst meal i think i have ever had when travelling. very cynical not to put prices on the drinks and then to overcharge so ruthlessly."
-1. absolutely disgusting only us in queue waited 15 minutes to order breakfast then 15 minutes to pay by this time good was stone cold. we requested a replacement meal. food was disgusting and just slapped on cardboard plate. staff so slow and more interested in eating own breakfast. masks being worn on chin not covering mouth or nose. tables dirty.
truly disgraceful portions and price. cannot believe that jamie oliver would condone this if he knew. image of double portion of salad. (very tasty though)
a portion of pasta salad was literally two pieces of greasy penne and an olive and two bits of tomato. staff unfriendly and its so overpriced for the portions. cant believe jamie oliver put his name to this. i came here because i thought it would be tasty and well prepared. so disappointing. do not eat here.
"ok, so the pandemic has meant the travel industry has taken a huge hit with low traffic/travellers but this restaurant was embarrassing! it was six oclock in the evening & the selection of food was non-existent or dried up! the only food for a gluten free diet was a dried up salad, the lasagne my husband ate in desperation looked like it had been out since 10.00am. truly awful! the floor & tables were grubby & the staff half asleep. you have to wonder whether jamie oliver would eat there!"
slow service. sleepy atmosphere. nothing to as jamies says kick-start your morning. poor food and quite pricey. i asked few times for a sandwich that takes 30sec to make. avoid.
departure area 3. poor cappuccino and sickly brownie for more than 8 euros. only place open for coffee so  not much choice. slap your name on any crap. i seem to remember eating here a couple of years ago and it was lousy then too.
"we had a morning flight so chose to eat at the airport. i ordered a bacon bap but unfortunately after eating a mouthful, i discovered it had onions in it! i have a reaction to onions which makes my body swell and i get intense stomach ache. the menu did not say the item contained onions!"
"i ordered a pizza,and got piec of dried bread.i could hardly cut the pizza with the plastic fork.this place was a huge disappointment."
"it was overpriced like all the other food on airports. the veggie breakfast bowl i got was okay, but the bacon sandwiches were disappointing: a bun with 2 strips of bacon and some sautéed onions. they also have smoothies which they make to order and pre-made baguettes with ham&cheese, mozzarella, chicken, etc. not worth it to come by here!"
i wish id read some of the reviews beforehand. the restaurant itself looks ok but thats as far as it goe 
"fly here a lot thought i’d try some where new. tried a slice of pizza, very little cheese tomato sauce and pepperoni for 8 euro what a joke another rip off place!!  i would not put my name to this place won’t be coming back!!!"
insane prices worst quality. just skip this please if you can. the owner of this place is only there to make you lose money without doing anything
expensive spot in the airport for some last minute food.. nothing special altho it gives the look of a more upmarket establishment
"made the mistake of reading the reviews after ordering! this was the most expensive meal we had in amsterdam and by far the worst. €40 for 2 breakfasts including a €5 bottle of water - i realise food at airports is generally more expensive but i do not see how this is justified. dirty tables because staff are so busy serving customers, other reviews mentioned rude staff but i must say we did not encounter this. food was not bad, but i believe you should get what you pay for and this was not even close to a €40 meal."
"this is easily the absolute worst place i have ever eaten. the tables had lively lamps on them, but were caked in dust. i mean just absolutely covered. as if someone had just found them in their grandparents basements after 50 years being in there. wipe the things. thats all i ask. and they are on the table that you eat at, thats whats so ba "
lasagne good but small porti 
"can i give no stars? never had to before. looks like prison food, £30 for the privilege. waited 25 mins for slop. hideous. walk on by. how does jo put his name to this crap!!! didn’t even get all items!! probably a blessing."
"terrible place! poor service, moody and careless staff borderline with rudeness. the place stop serving breakfast at 10:30 am. a total waste of a prime space."
"i came here for a pasta salad, which was the cheapest item on the menu. tasty enough and plenty of seating area. experience was slightly ruined when i saw a mouse scurrying under one of the tables...bit worrying at an airport?"
£12-95 absolutely awful never again chilli beans at the bottom awful place staff don’t care what they serve you
after visiting this establishment in march we didnt have a great experience as our food was undercooke 
sausage sandwich and coffee coming to €15 ...sandwich was mediocre. most staff barely spoke english and they did not ha e basic condiments - ketchup / brown sauce. also not one member of staff could advise where the napkins were. would not go here again!
"hardly any hot food, very poor pitza, overpriced, never again. come on jamie get your act together ...."
"we were a party of 6 travellers and decided to try that old conman jamie oliver. everyone of us agreed that mcdonalds is the way to go. we all paid €12.95 for a full breakfast. no drink included, so another €3 for a tea or coffee. no value for money here. the eggs were tasteless, potatoes hard, bacon not too bad, tomatoes were over done and bland, they had no mushrooms, so offered me peppers. laughable, an english breakfast ruined for the sake of olivers art. i can imagine his airport delis will be following shortly. 6 customers that wont be visiting again."
there wasn’t a big range of food when i got here. i went for lasagne with salad and potatoes although i just got a little portion of rocket. the food was tasty and i got the apple pie with cream. they only did heineken so got a red wine. overall it was more than 24 euros with plastic cutlery and food in cardboard boxes. i expected more for what i paid.
"to bridge the time of 10 hours at schiphol we (3 couples) decided to eat at jamies dinner. although the taste of pasta was pretty good, it was a huge disappointment. served in a cardboard box, lukewarm and half full, the price of 8 euros is way too much money. the seats were not clean and napkin not available. too bad for a case that bears the name of jamie. eaten better at other jamie locations for a more reasonable price than here. the price is absolutely disproportionate for what and the quantity you get served. unfortunately"
"english breakfast tasted awful, no sausages no bread. tiny portion for the price. $0.60 for ketchup!"
sausage sandwich line up to get it only 5 people in the queue. 15 mi 
i bought lasagne and a drink and a bag of popcorn. it was half the lasagne portion he served to his friend in the queue behind me. i had to ask for parmesan and half a dozen sprigs of greens. this was begrudged and a tiny helping. i paid €20 for this insult which did not resemble the picture of the serving on the board above the serving counter in any way or for 
"choice of foods and drinks, overpriced most probably due to being located in the airport... my wife had a fete tomato salad, i had a tuna baguette. the food was ok, the service was o "
absolutely terrible experience for breakfast with my fami 
"hard breakfast on outbound trip and lunch on the way back, both times the food was good although a little expensive"
"the selection of food is not as good as the menu suggests, much of it looks as if it has been out for a long time, the service is slow. my salad was adequate but my sparkling water was not chilled. there will not be a repeat visit. jamie oliver should not put his name to such mediocrity. "
left over nasty foul pizza and horrible salad for 33 euros people miserable and resent customers this place should be closed down by the health department
sad i can’t give this place negative reviews. not only is the food extremely overpriced (even by airport standards) but they don’t allow you to make simple changes (i couldn’t even get a side of bacon and my friend couldn’t add cheese to her bacon toastie). when i got to the counter they said i couldn’t pay with my card even though all my friends did and they all had visas just like i did. i only had dollars and somehow my already outrageous total of 18 euros went up to 28 us dollars (?!?!?!!). to top it all off my croissant was burnt. bottom line-don’t let your hunger blind you as this is the first cafe you see when passing security. keep moving there’s loads better (even mcdonald’s).
food was mediocre the only thing worth getting is their espresso and chocolate croissant. this place is extremely overpriced. try to avoid it if you can.
we stopped here for food before catching a ryanair flight to dublin. coffee was good. smoothie was good. sandwiches were goo 
"arrived @ schipol with time & wanted breakfast. too bad i didn’t check the reviews. full english breakfast: streaky bacon good, cumberland sausage good, roasted tomato very good, portobello mushroom (full half) also very good. but then! beans quite tasty (not the usual mushy beans), before the spiciness kicked in — *very* spicy, very un-english. similarly, the scrambled eggs. who makes scrambled eggs spicy!? if you like spicy, the food was quite good. my palate won’t be back, however."
at the airport we didnt want burgers and wanted to sit at a table to eat. jamies looked ok and prices not b 
when we saw jamie’s deli at the airport we were delighted having always wanted to try one out. what a major disappointment from start to finish. miserable staff and despite it being empty no-one rushed to serve us and we were stood waiting for sometime. numerous staff walked past us but none seemed bothered we were stood waiting. eventually the “worlds most miserable young girl” came and served us and told me to go and pay at the checkout then come back. she took forever to scoop the pulled pork into the baps!! had i not have paid already i would have walked out at this poin 
"would have walked away having looked at the 3 horrendous dried up school canteen hot offerings and the all bread no filling sandwiches, but my colleague was starving, wanted a seat, and it was the quietist eating place in the airport........it is obvious w "
"glad something was open early.  found there were quite a few choices for breakfast.  i loved the array of pitchers full of flavored waters.  service was quick and polite, they were constantly cleaning counters and tables.  got a latte to go also."
"it was an easy choice, jamies deli, if you dont want fat fast food or a sloppy sandwi "
very tasty but i was quite stunned to receive less than half a single aubergine as an €8 serving of aubergine parmigiana. and serving it in a small diameter but deep cardboard bowl with plastic cutlery is a joke. disappointing.
"our plane had a delay over 6,5 hou "
"came here for some quick food before our flight and we’re crazy shocked at the prices and poor choice. the vegetarian hot option was ‘aubergine parmigiana’ which was not even half an aubergine with some tomato sauce and cheese and they wanted €8!? if you wanted potatoes with it that was an extra €4, a bottle of water is also about €4. i complained to the server who just shrugged so we headed over to mcdonald’s, not my first choice but you can at least get a good veggie chicken burger meal for less than €12. save you’re money and go elsewhere!"
where do i sta 
"over-seasoned to hell, served in a box, terrible service - would have expected a lot more from jamies having previously eaten at his restaurants. wish id have gone to mcdonalds.. at least theres a consistent standard which there doesnt seem to be at jamies."
"my wife and i had a quick meal at lunch time at jamies deli fast-food restaurant in the food-court located at schiphol international airport on 12th may 2019. the restaurant is on the first floor and was not too crowded. there was ample seating. we collected a tray and served ourselves before making the payment at the service counter. it was a quick meal at a reasonable price, but with plastic plates, cups and cutlery. no personalized service to speak of!"
quick service but motorway cafe standard food- should pizza be chewey? 
"celebrity chef, airport restaurant? after walking through the entire airport looking for a place to eat we settled on jamies deli, it had a good name attached to it and the food looked good. the process to actually order the food was a nightmare and took forever even though there was only 5 or 6 people in front of me. i did not understand while it was taking so as there was plenty of people behind the counter to make this work efficiently but maybe they were unsure how to do that or maybe some of them were just lazy? i ordered the full monty and my girlfriend got a cheese toasty, the full monty was delicious with roasted portabella, cumberland sausage, rashers, grilled onion all served on brioche. the toasty and fresh squeezed juice were good as well. just need to figure out that service piece now. review would have been excellent if based on the food alone, and yes of course its a little pricey, its in the airport!"
"pepperoni pizza was a square of thick dough, with 3 slices of sausage and a scraping of tomato base. i had aubergine bake and it was tasteless. a ‘portion’ of herbed potato at €4.50 could not be called a serving....easy to count how many were in the carton. go to mcdonald’s instead :-("
"i have been to jamie oliver’s restaurant at schiphol airport three times now. the first two visits were disappointing (eg the bircher müsli tastes as if someone added more cinnamon than oats, staff opened the restaurant 40 minutes later than the official opening time etc.). my visit yesterday was disastrous. i got severe food poisoning from the superfood wrap. there must be also some issues in terms of hygiene in the kitchen. it’s a shame as i like jamie oliver’s cook shows but this place is far from his cooking on tv."
"soggy, unappetising veggie breakfast served in a disposable pot with single use cutlery. really disappointing and not the quality of food or dining experience i’ve come to expect from jamie’s. give it a miss."
"i had.  atrocious thin watery lukewarm porridge with a meagre plastic pot of honey very bland tasteless cappuccino, also lukewarm. sausage sandwich with fried/caramelised onions was average at best.."
"wanted the full & veggie breakfast. waited in line like forever only to be told there were no eggs left but server went on to serve the lady after me, stating eggs were only enough for one. she couldve at least told me she had only enough for one. ended up ordering a sandwich but turned out to be the most pathetic ever. do not come here! coffee is bad too. "
"food is jamies style, a healthy approach to the comfort british food you crave while travelli "
i decided to treat the family to something a little nicer at the airport and was drawn in by the great design of the restaurant and name associated with quality foo 
"the food is excellent, i had the full monty roll with bacon and cumberland sausage and a bircher muesli and coffee. as i waited for my order to be made which seemed to take longer than one would have thought i saw that they only had one person serving on the tills and doing coffee with a long queu in spite of lots of other staff around. i like my food as jamie intended, which in this case hot. i decided to say to the serving staff that i would eat and pay after otherwise my food would be cold. they were fine about this but it meant i could not get any coffee or ketchup which is 60cents per sachet (really jamie!!!

it is in a great location eg its the first eatery you see when clearing security!!

"absolutely dreadful! the pulled pork was lukewarm and bland. the muesli pot was runny and far inferior to pret or itsu. staff were morose. staggered jamie would put his name to this place!, please sort it out!,"
"rubbish, had a penne pasta dish, served in a cardboard box, 60 percent full, tasted like a microwave meal from iceland, how jamie oliver can put his name on this food shows how completely out of touch from the image he portrays. i won’t ever by another book or watch your shows ever again! shame on you jamie!!!!!"
"never again, the server behind the counter actually weighed the portion, adding the 3 hour old slop into a cardboard container, then taking some out and then adding some more till he hit the prescribed weight, he then repeated this for the baby potatoes adding and removing in a similar fashion.swapping our larger for smaller potato "
"dreadfully presented, tired salads, overly sweet pulled pork, food that has been sat being kept warm for hours, dirty wine glass, piece of plastic in the salad, plastic cutlery, worst airport food in a long tim "
service dreadful. and rip off. ladies behind counter won’t answer my request for napkins. second request i’m told they are out of napkins (in a deli!) and i’m offered a tiny peace of indefinite cleaning/toilet paper in replacement. lunch is ruined for good now. thx
had pasta. wish i had not.  simply dreadful.   dirty floors dirty tables and vile awful disgusting food and a total rip off.   jamie you put your name to it.  you should be ashamed.
where to start ...over €8 for a bowl (tiny tiny portion) of penne bolognese ...the additional €3.50 for a rocket and parmesan salad - 7 rocket leaves dropped on top of the penne without a hint of parmesan ...the long que while your tiny expensive food goes cold ...the difficulty of managing your tray and hand luggage ...the clearly unhappy st 
if youve been to schipol then you know this place. its the first thing you see when you come through passport contro 
"expensive, very poor service, unhelpful staff, poor food waste of money disappointing end to a fantastic wkend"
"i ordered the pulled pork and it felt like drinking syrup. so sweet. my coffee took nearly 10 minutes because the cashier was chatting, then she forgot my order, then she forgot i had paid, then she forgot i had asked for soy milk. had i not been so hungry and afraid of throwing food i would have poured everything down the drain."
"i was surprised with how simple the restaurant looks like. when my husband said jamie, i was like as in jamie oliver? when we checked the food on display, we were hesitant as there was nothing special on offer it’s just like a fast food restaurant. food taste good, who can go wrong with pizza and pasta? we also had pulled pork comes with little coleslaw without bread. "
"what a dump!! not what i was expecting at all! it’s like a school canteen but least they get proper knives and forks! so the menu reads ok but then u realise it’s just someone plonking some pasta from a massive bowl in a cardboard tub wow tasted ok but very little quantity there. the new potatoes that cost €4 for 13 small potatoes wow, again tasted ok but £13 for these two items! the place was filthy, 85% of tables were dirty and empty and i had to clear my own table twice!! never again i’d rather spend less know what i’m getting an have a dirty mcdonald’s. no wonder jamie is on the decline!! shut the place "
absolutely awful considering this place acts as a high quality place to eat in the airport. two tiny bowls of average pasta and a bottle of warm pepsi cost €20!!! should have just gone to mcdonalds for half the price.
ate at this deli yesterday.  service was dreadful.  food cold.  overpriced.  dirty tables.  this is second visit and never again.
"now i know airport eateries are expensive as you are a captive audience but £12.50 for a small coffee, a small bottle of orange juice and a small bottle of still water is an insult! did consider a sandwich but quickly abandoned the idea when i saw the prices started at £6.50 and went up from there! and £3.45 for a single croissant! avoid and go elsewhere"
"staff were super friendly and lovely but unfortunately the food wasn’t worth the price you pay. you expect airport food not to be the best but as i’m veggie i ordered the safe option of the cheese and mushroom toasted sandwich it had probably less than one mushroom on and a thin slice of cheese. spent around €22 for two toasted sandwiches, a small coffee and a lipton ice tea - a sachet of ketchup is €0.60. it wasn’t the worst experience but just wish we got more for our money."
"no idea where to start. rudest staff that i have come across in a long time. stale food, in warm refrigerators. i decided just to take a drink but they only took cash. so i asked if there was a café or bar in departures instead, to which i received a shrug of the shoulders. no postitives to say at all."
came for breakfast. unbelievably small portion for 11eur. and completely cold by the time made to front of line. and bland scrambled eggs.
"sandwich was of the day before. the bread was soggy and half baked, the salad was almost black, the tomatoes slimy...in other words not to eat and paid exhiobitant prices! is that jamie’s quality food??? never again"
simply awful! don’t waste your money! they had run out of half the items before 1pm or more likely never had them. toastier was disgusting. no point adding about anything else as everything was poor
not enough staff. no apology for huge waiting time. one bloke just walking round doing nothing when he could be serving. ran out of bacon at 9.30am? terrible service. will never step foot in a jamie oliver establishment again.
"this place doesn’t even deserve 1 star. we were at the front of the queue and waited 20 minutes for a bacon sandwich?! asked for scrambled egg also and it was a huge deal like we couldn’t have any. the girl that was serving us was unbelievably rude. i have never seen such bad customer service in my life! i asked for bacon in my sandwich, i was willing to pay an extra euro or whatever but she replied and said we don’t do that. while we were ordering, a man came over as he had ordered a vegetarian breakfast which said it included beans on the menu. he came over and complained that he had already paid for it and there was no beans and the girl just said “well we don’t have any beans so how am i supposed to put them in in your breakfast” avoid at all costs!"
" we wanted to have something to eat before taking our morning flight. we stopped at jamies but was still not opened, we checked internet page it said open at 7am was already 7:3 "
"second time here, i thought the first time was bad.. "
"cups and plates everywhere, sticky floor, the waitresses chatting amongst each other, not actually doing anything. the food is awful (besides they only had 2 options at the time we were there). only the wine is worth your money."
"8m used to appalling airport food, but here they manage to make an attractive looking cheese and tomato croissant into a semi burnt offering! service slow, very slow in fact. 5he place is a tip, empty coffee cups everywhere, uncollected rubbish. avoid at all costs"
"no wonder jamie  oliver is closing his restaurants.  ate here recently and it was awful. pasta with bolognaise sauce, stodgy, overcooked congealed mess.  to add insult to injury it was also lukewarm .  would never eat there again, avoid at all cots"
are here today. food was dehydrated and the pasta was crispy from sitting under the heat lamps. portion was small for the price.
"ordered a cheese and ham toastie. afeter finding a table which had actually been cleared, found that there was no ham in the toastie, only cheese. went back to get a refund for the ham part of the toastie, which was given without too much trouble. i thought a restaurant with the jamie oliver name would be good but i won’t be back."
"absolutely disgusting calling a english breakfast ( salty new potatoes and soggy eggs and massive mushrooms) for 12€ you having a laugh most ridiculous joke i’ve heard of, no one go here , imagine jamie oliver trying to promote healthy eating then putting salt on everything lol funny one that one."
"we arrived in terminal 3 schipol for an early flight and were looking for breakfast. the website says that jamies opens at 7.00 am so we hung around a bit, at 7.05 i popped under the barrier to ask the staff busy cooking what time they would open. i had several different answers from a couple of staff members from 7.10 to 7.30 or maybe 8.00 am. needless to say we ate elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!"
first of all ive eaten in jamies restaurant in liverpool uk so i was expecting a similar kind of food quality. we ordered 2 of the ultimate cheese toastie and a piece of apple cak 
terrible service.  deli forgot about our order even though we were visibly standing 10 feet away and had reminded them.
cappuccino was boiling hot. cheese and ham sandwich turned out to be a disgusting sweet onion paste with cheese. barely edible.  really slow service. bad value for money.
"£26 for two coffees and two sandwiches would have been easier to stomach if the service had been better, one poor man serving breakfasts with a queue about 20 deep and others making lunchtime sandwiches, why did they not hep o "
"we had the pulled pork, plus beetroot quinoa salad both very tasty, ordered a side portion of new potatoes. the pulled pork had great fresh flavour, it was moist and the potatoes were infused in olive oil, garlic and rosemary. very satisfied....confused about the bad reviews. the man serving the food was very friendly and smiley."

"let’s get the bad bit out of the way first , paid €4.65 for 19 grapes. please jamie don’t ever take about the importance of fresh food every day at that price. oh and two of the were rotten . have eaten here before service is slow and they never have the full menu of offer . when it’s only 6 mains you would think that was possi "
"the menu is simple but varied. the seating typical jamie. some dishes are better than others but the mushroom pizza was very good. one comment by several patrons was about the amount of plastic being used, which surprises me of jamie. the lady in front of us asked not to cover the carton bowl with a plastic cover as she was having her meal in the restaurant. the answer was “sorry it is policy and i cannot serve the food without the cover”. jamie should know better. "
"very bad costumer service. the staff seems very unhappy and unfriendly. no respond to “hello”, no thank you. when we asked if we can pay in pounds the respond was yes however when we asked if we could have the change back in pounds as well the respond was sarcastic: i’m not a bank! clearly there is a better way to respond to a costumer who pays €3.50 for a baby portion of salad! we would not be coming back ; not an experience we would expect from jamie’s deli."
"a typical jamie experience, relying on the emperors new clothes syndrome to indicate that nothing you do or put your name to can be awful. it can and it is! visited before our return flight to london, should have know better after a previous terrible experience at jamies italian in kingst "
hot food (overpriced) was cold by the time the payment queue cleared. everything that an airport café should not be.
"jamie, close this branch down for the sake of your international name. there was a huge queue while we watched a lady neatly tidy up some bottles of overpriced water while there was only one staff member at the till. i asked if she’d kindly serve us and she refused saying that she has to straighten the water bottles. she then slowly walked to the counter and served us with a stinking attitude. lots of staff around despite there being a queue, over heated food at the deli counter, really expensive product, almost €3 for a bag of popcorn!!!! eventually we were served and i got a reply of, ‘i don’t care, i’ll be gone next week anyway”. this is a busy airport, one of the busiest in the world and is making you look terrible. you’re reviews are also very poor! super disappointed and i am a big jamie fan! xx"
i visited this awful restaurant for the first time in schiphol airport in amsterdam two days ago and all i can say is its sooooooo bad! on the screen it shows you photos of all the meals which you can get and the prices. the customer in front of me oredered the pulled pork and she got quite a big amount and so i opted for the penne bolognaise as the tub it came in on the photo was full to the brim with lovely looking tasting food also. when the girl served the dish she put 2 spoons into the tub and it was so small! it cost me 7.95 euros for one tub! there was hardly any meat in it nor cheese. it was quite tastless too. i was still hungry after eating it. myself and my partner got the same dish plus a beer and it came to 21.90 euros!!! jamie you should be ashamed of yourself charging that amount for such a tiny meal!! avoid at all costs!!!
"it is a disgrace - we stopped here as it was the first venue when you come through security (clever placement). menu looks good with a decent selection of food. i ordered superfood salad and fresh pressed juice. salad had tastless beetroot and 2 soggy bits of dead broccoli in it, juice was rancid. husband ordered pasta dish - badly burnt pasta that you could chip a tooth eating and the meat was nuked and smelt awful. kids had pizza - it was flat bread with greasy cheese. bill was €50 - we left the food behind, hungy and annoyed we boarded our flight as when we walked to gate we saw so many other better places to eat - do not stop here!!"
"the food was actually ok. however, after i had joined the food queue to get my slice of hot pizza i didnt stay in that queue but instead had to join a second queue to pay and join it at the back. whoever, thought this through needs to think again. its bad enough when you go to a motorway service station and your hot breakfast is quickly chilling as you approach the till but the process i describe here is doubly bad. the pizza was actually pretty good but i was boiling with frustration made worse by the people on the till making coffees too thus further slowing things down"
"we had a nice lunch, taste was great. high proces : bottle of spa rood 0,5 liter costs 3,75 eu "
"having decided to give jamie a try i ended up going hungry. i could list a number of problems, but they were just about excusable in a very busy schiph "
"i have tried on numerous times both pizza and pasta - and sad to say i rather buy frozen ones at albert heijn or make my own - my kids dont eat them, and i must say we have been dissapointed everytime. we wont be back here again at all"
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
while the food was very good what i missed was the extra dot on the i. could there be for example a small dish of oil for the otherwise dry toast? portions for lunch adequate for seniors but perhaps a bit too little for younger appetites. staff friendly . tonys lemon cheese cake is superb.
"i visited a friend in assen, she booked this restaurant. its large amount for me, and plenty of bread,my friend ordered pizza it was alright, but there are too much sauce in my lasagna. service is nice and tiramisu cake is great. i er not to common whether its authentic since it relates to different perspectives. overall it was an okay experience."
"the most important step in pizza preparation is to make a soft and elastic dough. it sounds simple but its really an art. unfortunately, chefs of bella italia didnt master this craft therefore i have to rate the pizza as an average. and i am still quite kind to the "
good food but a little too commercially orientated. the restaurant was packed on a tuesday. i got seated at a table that was in the middle of the path the waiters used to get to the kitchen. there shouldn’t have been a table there. i would compare the food to a happy italy but you’ve got a couple more options and it’s a little more expensive.
"busy for a weekday. enough staff to serve all the guests, we lost count of the number of waitresses/waiters coming to our table. nice food, but both pizza and calzone were very salty. the calzone was mostly crispy crust."
"just come back from a weeks stay in assen and we had to visit bella italia twice! the first visit was just myself and my wife we both had yummy pizza ( no 46) thin crust, loads of toppings and the size of a small family car wheel! what’s not to like about that, we sat inside which was a bit of a mistake as it was very warn but all in all a nice eveni "
had pizza here and couldn’t fault the food. we ate outside on a hot day and the flies were all over. very annoying. would definitely recommend to eat inside on a hot day
"ordered a scaloppa ala gorgonzola as a take-home dinner. there was absolutely no gorgonzola on our plates. we ate it because i didn’t want to drive into town again, but i sent a message to the restaurant. no answer. then i sent a mail to the restaurant. so far, no answ "
"went with family and friends on a warm summers evening in august 2017. we sat outside, sharing our corner with a friendly cat  "
we went with a friend whi goes there oft 
"restaurant was busy but had plenty of staff. quick to take order but slow to deliver. waitress was wondering aimlessly with drinks on a tray , eventually caught her eye and managed to rescue wine, when meal came the lasagne was poor lot of pasta but short on filling and very bland, spag bol not much better lot of spaghetti but very little bolanaise sauce. quick to take payment for the meal but still waiting for my change - luckily not much - will not use this place again."
"food is ok but not brilliant. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. thought the pizza was too greasy. bit stodgy but relatively cheap. location good though on the market, normally quite a few people eating there due to affordability. next door is better."
visit the place on a fridayevening with my girlfriend. crowded: reservation is recommend 
we were quite a large group on 2 tables. we were put under a canopy and offered blankets or at least some were. the table i was on put the order in about 10 minutes before the other table and guess who got there meal first. yep you guest the other tabl 
its a large restautant and the tables are place very close to eachother. the choice of pizza and pasta is enormous. the portions are big. we had a starter and couldnt finish the pizza.
"ive gotten pizza here twice and i can say that these are the worst pizzas ive ever had in my entire life. frozen oven pizzas at the store are more enjoyable than this, it feels like they make the pizzas with cheese and tomato sauce then just dumb a bunch of ingredients on there reheat it and done....."
massive size pizza and thats where the meal went downhill soggy in the middle and tasteless  everything out of a tin  asked for piquant and struggled to find a chilli overpriced and poor
"im not sure what went wrong this time. this restaurant has expanded its seating capacity without the proportinal expansion of kitchen capacity. the result is that the service is slow and clearly the staff are weary of the stress placed upon them by this imbalance. we waited nearly an hour for the starter, after asking again for it. another long delay before we invoked the five minute rule and then got up, asked for the bill for what we had had, paid and left. down the road is the el nil, excellent shoarma, served within seven minutes of our arrival!"
"the pizzas were ok, nothing very special. the salad was also ok, but i expected something more from italian kitchen."
"business dinner with a colleague. we order to pizzas, nothing spezial. i was expecting more. maybe i made the wrong choice, because the restaurant was full in a thursday evening. some families and couples around.  nice decoration and service. everybody speaks fluent english."
had a seafood pizza. was nothing to get excited about. was expecting a little more that average with such a high rating. beer was flat but saw them pouring the beer and adding old beer from a glass to top it up.
"we placed an order but we got unfortunately the wrong order (their mistake) after a phone call with not a very friendly man they said they would come back and give the new order once arrived they requested extra payment for the correct order .. so we eventually payed twice, we are very unsatisfied. wouldnt recommend this place to anyone"
"although there were lots of food varieties in the menu, since there was no english menu and waitress was not able to help, we chose randomly. i had a pizza and my wife had a pasta. both were below average in taste and look."
"both ordered the same bistecca which was no good, too chewy. the chef said it was not and we could order something else and pay the difference. no sorry, no nothing. poor service. a free cup of coffee is so easy, cheap and can change the feeling of a customer. but no. a sorry costs even less and can change the experience. but no. lot to learn!"
"the restaurant is very customer friendly. deco is also nice and simple. but the food is often unstable of quality. sometines its really good, but most of the time very average. the prices are some what high for the unsteadiness of the quality. but the staff is very nice and deserves second changes. the delivery services are not up to par for the asking price. i will recommend to visit the restaurant."
i had a dinner at restaurant sorrento with a friend. it was during the week and around half of the available tables were occupied. after ordering it took quite some time before we got our dinner served. the food is average. i was not impressed with the service staff. the wine is quite expensive and very few wines to choose from. the pinot grigio tasted to sweet for me. i was expecting the lemon-citrus flavo 
"what started out as a shoarma vendor twenty years ago is now pretty much the go-to place for pizza: when italian restaurant ponte vecchio is closed, or when you need to change up flavou "
"i came across a good deal for this restaurant, which was why we ended up here in the first place because i’d never heard of i "
"a combination of bad food and unfriendly personnel. huge waiting time, although the place was not full.  ladies toilet was dirty.  there are other places to spend your money. do not go to pompei."
"friendly staff and nice atmosphere but rather bland food, or at least, pizzas. the list of available pizzas is huge, and the pizzas come with abundant toppings, but i can’t say much more than that. unfortunately it all tasted rather bland."
"i took a pizza for me and my husband because of the nice reviews here. but i am considering about my decision after our dinner. just want to be honest, it was not a really pizza, not italian one either. so, we wont choose here for the next time. "
"the waiting time in pompei is quit long and after the long waiting the pizza is almost cold. the prices are also not very cheap. even they have special prices for students i would rather pay more but have a good quality pizza for that money. when the restaurant is crowded it is getting really hot inside. the entrance is also a payment place and the kitchen for the pizza which i personally dont think this is very sanitary. well, i was very disappointed with the pizzeria, especially because it does have a nice rating in here ...."
"the pizza could use fresher ingredients. the dough is a little chewy (raising method?!).. i still havent found a place in the netherlands where they actually use mozzarella instead of just tasteless kaas. we were a big group seated in the back of the restaurant, everybody got home with clothes that stunk like kitche "
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of récola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"we had a dinner yesterday, the risotto porcini was like porridge, although we told the waiter that it was terrible, either he or the owner didnt make any effort to apologise, or to cook it again, the dish was very pricey, normally you expect higher standard. be careful they also charge for parmesan cheese to sprinkle on your risotto. it is a reap off, stay away from them."
"i just had the worst pizza ever. in a place that was recommended as serving the best pizza in town. perhaps they have good ones but the frutti di mare i tried had the worst bottom i have ever had. so soggy it was as if there was pasta carrying the filling. that filling consisted of mussels, shrimps, tuna and perhaps other things. too much too salty. deeply disappointing. be cautioned."
"not sure what we missed, nice people and a very cosy restaurant. pizzas not too bad, definitely not that great, pasta was too dry, sauce too thick, way too much pasta. the rest of the family ate their dishes but i just couldn’t eat much of my marinara pasta, sauce too thick & dry, tiny shrimps, tuna all mushed up in the sauce, like a mashed up lasagna. mine was really bad."
came here to get some lunch- ordered a brownie to share afterwards. about half the brownie was okay. not great (and served straight from the fridge) but acceptabl

"the people/restaurantstaff in leeuwarden are so friendly when it comes to tableservice. inside there are loads of tables and a chilled vibe. we had a nice table on the terrace, drinking wine & peroni. the service was really fast and we had our pizzas in no time. the pizzas though, were not great."
"it was a nice surprise, it looks very cozy, quiet and not very busy. there is a lot of space for dinning. the food was ok, and the decoration i also liked it. not bad. (the olive oil is not italian, it is from spain. good choice 😉)"
"nice decor, lovely food, service was not good. way understaffed although the staff were really nice and friendly. 14 or 15 euros for most pizzas or pastas, desserts fairly priced, some starters over priced."
"we selected this restaurant based on its high rating in google maps. the service is very good but the pizza is average. the dough is good and crunchy but the topping is disappointing, very little amount of cheese. i was expecting more."
"friendly service but poor food.started with popcorn with paprika and a kind of kerry dipsauce which is a strange choice for an appetizer;i had the gnocchi which were tasteful but the main course(fresh fish) was very disappointing,sauce was too thick,fish not really fresh...the white wine proposed by the waiter was a viognier montmarin and was very good.i hope it was just a bad day for the cook because the service was friendly but the food bad and clumsy presentation."
we have been here a few times now. the icecream is allright but not the very best. theres however plenty of flavors to choose from and service with a smile.
"the choices of pasta offered on the menu were relatively disappointing. i expected to have a lot more and extraordinary ways of how to serve pasta, however, i experienced the menu being not very satisfying and quite usua "

we visited this restaurant with a dozen people (we obviously made a reservation). we had a few different waiters serve us and all seemed unhappy to be the

tables are close togeth 
this restaurant is really not what you want. the menu is very outdated. there are things crossed out and written in pen. so maybe its time for them to order some new me 
we have been to this restaurant twice: is located in the center city and all the waiters are italians like the own 
little family owned restaurant serving average food. if youre looking for a 10 euros gaz-oven-baked pizza you would probably be happy. definitely not worth the visit. if youre hesitating with other places i suggest you try them first.
"the food and portion size is ok. i think the chef buys the cheapest ingredients available and not the best. the service is alright we were welcomed and placed at a table politely. it was busy and we had to wait a bit (but just not too) long for our meals. the decor seems somewhat old, but that is sometimes also the case in italy and for me not the main thing. the tables were dressed with nice linnen tablecloth and serviettes rather than with paper which i myself appreciat "
the interior of the restaurant is just outdated and it looks ready for renovation. i was disappointed by the quality of the food and the lack of passion that apparently went into it.we had a caprese which was unexciting and a tournedos which vos reasonable but not superb that the winds were fine and the waiter took time to explain the origin 
"not amazed, was a normal pizza and pasta, not special. don’t understand why this is nr1 on tripadvisor. pizza was good but really standard, pasta with truffle was no fresh truff "
"not worth the money, 14 euro for a tiny portion of mediocre lasagna is not worth it.  the ragu (bolognese) isnt seasoned properly. and lacks flavor.   i am really disappointed. i expected a lot more."
"an italian restaurant with a good atmosphere in arnhem centre, immediately near the shopping area. we enjoyed good pasta and nice fish, nothing wrong with that. but i found the prices rather exaggerated (my main course was 24,50 for a good piece of fish, two half potatoes, one small tomato etc. not quite enough for this sort of price. tasty bread was charged extra, a 75cl bottle of sparkling water at 5,75. i mean, come on.) staff were very friendly and helpful, though."
"we came back after 10 years. the food is still the reason to come here. dont mind the 70ties interior. the service is not italian, the people didnt find the right approach and our waiter was topping up our glasses too often, which felt unpleasant. we missed the italian hospitality."
"we had dinner here in april. my daughter had a vegetarian option, i had a rib-eye steak. the food was good but overpriced and service was leisurely."
3 of us booked a table 6.00 we ordered 2 pizzas and a starter it was a mess we orderd a wine each. while we were waiting...and waiting and waiting!!! our bill was 70 euros mostly for the wine.. we were shocked.. girls were very nice but kitchen was chaos.. it took 2 hours before we got our dinner..also no anchovis..no green olives... never again!!!
"waiting for 1,5 hours and still the pizza wasnt the "
we went here with a group of 8. we got a table all the way back at the restaurant. lets say it was not the most cosy place they could give u 
"for this occassion we ate from the special ah-spaarkaart menu. luckily this did not mean that there was hardly choice. still we could either chose from this menu or a pasta / pizza. well done! good taste. my oven roasted chicken was delicious, bit cheesy though. "
"pastas is ok. doesnt taste like pastas in italy. staff are kind and helpful, cousy and easy to find from central station. toilets are clean but old and a bit messy. prices are reasonable."
"what do you expect from the pizza chain? a decent pizza at a good price. pasta dishes also available, but i did not have that. the pizza is exactly what you would expect."
"it is cheap; too cheap to make an eatable pizza obviously. the bottom is prefab; tasteless. topping of tuna: dry and no taste. no herbs, nothing. to add some flavour. my wifes pizza was little better."
tried here once very noisy and very very cramped more a young crowd place food was food nothing to talk about we will not be back
visited november 2013. english is spoken and there are english menus availab 
"slightly off the tourist track, this is a cosy restaurant worth trying if you fancy an italian. service was a little slow at times (hence the 3/5 score), but it was a very relaxed experience and the food was cooked well. i had the rigatoni all’arrabiata - delicious. very good value."
"the food at zafvino has always been great - along with the wines and wonderful antipasti, nothing to complain about. i think zafvino should consider to limit the amount of guests on the terrace if they want to keep the quality of their service hi "
"we made a reservation for indoors but turned up early for a drink beforehand. although there seemed to be many available tables outdoors under shelter where we would have been happy to sit in the meantime, we were offered a seat at a table apart, halfway in the rain. declining this, we left and returned for our meal; however, it didn’t seem they were expecting us, despite our arrival 45 minutes earlier. they offered us a place on bar-stools, while again, there were tables indoors available. when we asked to move, we were given a table near the entrance, where people were stood waiting to be seated. in these times of social distancing, this did not seem appropriate. we opted to leav "
"bustling restaurant, busy, nice atmosphere. we were allocated a spot where you practically needed a torch to see your food - extremely dark. moved - “that’s better...” wine was good! but waitress forgot half our food order. food took ages to arrive. difficult to get attention of waitresses. very frustrating. cos otherwise the place isn’t bad "
zafvino is one of my favourite places in arnhem however tonight i was quite disappointed by the services. it was full of young service (nothing wrong with that) only they were not attentive and there seemed to be no senior staff around. it’s not a bargain place so service should be to par it would be a shame that such an amazing wine and food place losses clients because of an easily solved problem. you can do better zafvino 
poor food poor service. the location is ok but the food is less than on would expect. service is poor asked for some extra bread never arrived.  perhaps for the best . not a place to sit and relax.
"arrogant service and presumptuous attitude. asked to see the wine list to be told there was not one and that the waiters were the wine list. upon asking, limited or no knowledge of italian wines. they claim to be an italian restaurant. food was average to good and the ambience was nice. its just a pity that the service dampens the overall quality of the evening. will not go there again."
"probably i was really unlucky, but my experience with this place was very ba "

"ive been at pinoccio during a business trip, advised by loca "
we have been coming to this restaurant for many years on our annual visit to arnh 
"if you want a quick pizza or pasta you can have it here. do not expect the best of food. it is a cosy restaurant near to shops, cinema and theater."
"its a cheap pizzeria and you get your value for money. a fine place for a catch up with friends, without breaking the bank."
rubbish rubbish rubbish and more rubbish the food was tasteless cannot think of anything good to say about it
"i went here with my partner because it is a famous place for pizzas. i will never come back. the pizza didn´t have any cheese and when we complain about it the service was really rude to us. the local is big but they put too many people and tables next to each other, you can´t eat confortably. i will not recomend this place,"
ok this place is cheap and convenient but quality is quite low. our pizzas were rather tasteless and the dough is clearly neither homemade nor properly baked. and why would you add fat on the crust to make it shine? this is nowhere to be found in italy and only makes pizzas look greasier than they are. add slow service and you wont get the romantic dinner you were expecti 
"based on all those reviews, we booked a table during the national restaurant week. unfortunately we were disappointed by the food, the service and the pric "
"we had high expectations based on the reviews but our experience was very poor. the owner clearly focuses on his regular customers and forgot about us. so other tables got served/could order before us (came in way later than we did), we refilled our wine and water glasses ourselves (other tables did get service) and tried to catch the owners attention several times. frustrati "
the pizza ( thin crust and very good) and pasta were good but we waited 45 minutes in an empty restaurant.  not worth the wait.

"this is an average, nothing special pizza/past joint, good quality freshly prepared dishes. the service is really good with orders taken promptly and attentive throughou "
"i dont know why so many good reviews were written, we found that the pizzas were ok, but the pastas were not good. the pasta was overcooked and the souse was not tasty."
"we had 2 pastas. mine was ok. the cabonara was with too much creme and to less eggs. but for the price it was ok. if u want quality, this isnt your place maybe. choose it yourself."
they do not know how to prepare italian pasta which was b 
"service was ok and the establishment seemed to be run with teenaged staff. the food was ok but lacked seasoning, and the salad was very oily. my husband said the pizza was good."
"after reading the excellent reviews on tripadvisor we decided to try this place out. the place looks nice: clean, a sunny terrace surrounded by greenery, kind staff, and very family- and dog friend "
"the food itself was ok, nothing special...the experience was ruined by very slow service and a terrible waiter that assisted us during our visit."
pizza bottom was totally burned. the top side was good. i was mainly busy cutting the burned parts out to be able to eat some of it. the place is called “happy italy”. as a customer i am not happy at all.
"because i had a very bad customer service, long time to be served, the food (pizza) came with bad smell (tomato was damaged) and we feel bad when we arrived home."
"the food has never been good, my pasta was cold and tasted horrible. there is no hygiene in the place, my table was dirty and literally had ants and spiders in it."
the service was friendly and efficient. the food was good with large portions.the pizzas looked good but i had the pasta. it was a big serving and was good. only problem was it wasnt very hot all the way through. good atmosphere for large groups. reasonably priced for families.
"when my friend pitched the idea that we eat at happy italy for dinner, i agreed in a heartbeat since i havent tried the food there yet. everything was seemingly efficient at first as we were greeted at the restaurants entrance, seated, and our orders taken without any fuss. their dishes are so-so but reasonably priced given their serving si "
"yesterday we went with the family to happy italy for an easy dinner. weve been there before and it was quite alright. also, we had take away and it was tast "
the shrimp wasnt fresh. it tasted too hard and die. so pity but the waiter is cute and polite. i dont recommend here for the dating or family. it has a good spot near by the station. thats all.
"while nothing to write home about, this restaraunt had quick service, the food was very hot and quite filling, and it was unbelievably cheap. i mean, cheaper than mcdonald’s cheap. for under 5€ you can get a massive ceasar salad with chicken. pizzas were in the 6-9€ range, and were large enough to serve two, unless you are absolutely starving. however, the pizza is a ready made, bland to the point of tasteless , crus "
the food is cheap and you definitely receive a lot for less. i think the concept must be appealing for teenagers. the quality of the food is matching its price.
"large portions and attentive staff, but very noisy and clearly a chain. pastadish seemed pre-cooked - although it was fine, pasta was a bit mushy and the sauce bland."
"after 2 meals, lunch and dinner, i am sure of one thing. i am not the demographic. that is pretty obvious when you look at the food and decoration. a large hall servicing mainly a younger crowd, more accustomed to take out. less discerning than a regular diner. the food came out way too fast. pasta was precooked and was on the verge of mush, the pizza was undercooked and soggy. the portions are also double the regular restaurant standards. the pasta was thinly coated with sauce and would have been better served with half the amount of pasta. i noted this to the servers, and the answer was that many diners prefer larger portion "
big dininghal that supposedly should have good food. started with standing in a cue outside that lasted almost 15 minutes before we got in. the pizza then came half baked with almost raw vegetables on top.... if you cant handle so many customers at once then please let someone wait 10 minutes longer but at least serve descent food! i do not recommend this place and will not return there again.
"everything was good, the group of us, 20 students from different countries who just met was having a nice time. then we had to pay and instead of making it separately, happy italy forced us to pay all together. and thanks to their tremendous effort of altruism and empathy they let us pay in 2 groups in the end! oh how good you are happy italy. what a pitty that next time i wont go with a group..."
this restaurant pretends to be an authentic italian restaurant but its just not really good. the pasta was barely warm and kind of blend. the service was good but the atmosphere in the restaurant was not so pleasant. i wouldnt go there again and i cant recommend it. 
"owner told us to move as they needed the table, after 20 minutes whilst we still had coffee onnits way.   never go here."
not so gud ol fast but chip products i dont like the service the pizza its veryyy bad no crispi nothing  dont go ther chip bat bad products
"on a budget and hungry? then this place will suit your needs, just dont expect anything special. its a large restaurant, the concept is serving a lot of people very quickly, with insane amounts of food for a fair price. the food is ok, service is friendly and very fast. but if its a great pizza/pasta you want and a little more atmosphere, there are better places to go in arnhem"
"great for a quick bite before going to the movies. food is at the table faster than your drink, within 10min of ordering. not the best though, but suits the prices you pay. with all the (better) italian restaurants in arnhem, i wouldnt return here any time soon."
plus - big portions and cheap. service is friendly. possibly to do doggyba 
industrial food. bulk purchase. low to non existent quality. this restaurant is intended for kids with no budget to speak of you can stomach anything. cardboard flavoured pas 
"really slow and bad service. we waited for almost an hour for all our orders. the waitress forgot to tell us that our order wasnt possible, so we found out by accident that we were waiting in vai "
they forgot my order. my mate was long done with his pizza before my pasta arrived. the pasta itself was also terrible. not recommended
the best thing about this spot is that it has good atmosphere and is cosy and warm (in cold or rainy day). food was average compensated partly by friendly waiters. it seems to be popular place as it was very busy. it is about one street away from the marketpla 
"service was quite slow, pizzas average and had toppings not included on the menu(not great if you dislike capsicum) and charged 7 euro for some bread to start, which, given it’s an italian restaurant, i would have thought was free or at least way less than a pizza! disappointing experience, will be sure to explore another option next time. "
"after 4-5 minutes waiting at the door to get seated (as the sign says) and a few eye contacts met the waiters, we left. it was about 60-70% full on a saturday afternoon, not a super busy period. i’m willing to wait longer for a table, but i don’t like to be ignored. doesn’t really work well in the hospitality business..."
"well, i should be honest and fair. pizza is a kind of “roma style”, so dough is very thin everywhere, and this was the case. ingredients were not tasty at all, not easy to feel cheese or ham or salami taste. the problem was that, this combination had a bad digestive consequences, that means cheese was not ok and dough not well don "
visited this restaurant on a tuesday evening. the restaurant is situated very convenient at the center of the city. the interior is contemporary which fits the location it is i 
"dont really like to give negative reviews but in this case i had too :( went in with the idea of getting a good fast food pasta. went to a similar concept of a restaurant in groningen, and zappas did not come near the quality of the groningen one. the service was just not good. when we got to the table we did not get a menu. after a while i asked the neighbours one. there were no options in type of pasta, only penne. i ordered the napilotana, and when i got it it had huge chunks of badly cut onions... they were not included in the description. the pizza the bf ordered was pretty descend. overall it was not really a fun experience."
the service it’s terrible and the dishes cooked without any comprehension of italian cooking style. item a typical dutch appetizers such as cheese plate was served without any consideration of the cheeses and the quality of product used was extremely law. i think they just work thanks to their amazing location. 
"when we visited the place just opened, so it might be one of the reasons we did not like it. staff had no coordination between each other. we asked for drinks three different waiters and after half an hour we still did not have our beers. then, the waitress came to double check which drinks we ordered. not professional. pizza was very average. "
"if you are tired after shopping or spending the day in the city center and want to quickly have dinner, this is a good place to go to; pricing is questionable for the quality of food but isnt expensive."
"great style, good food (no average italian, but a bit out of the box menu), okay drinks menu but the service was poor. they forgot half of our order, we had to wait long to get served and when we wanted tonpy the guy didnt even look at us while talking, hard to understand... however, the price and quality were good so ill give it a second chance and hopefully the service be better then.
