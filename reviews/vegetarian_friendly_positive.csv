we had a great french fries and kip saut√© sauce on them and two lovely salades with roasted goat cheese!
the food was excellent and the people very friendly. we enjoyed our stay in this small village and certainly the restaurant

"nice spicy food, restaurant isn‚Äôt anything special. we had enough to eat but not to much. we had a pleasant experience."
"great variety of vegetarian dishess. i took garlic nam as starter and panner tikka masala. was amazing the spice, paprika and coconut with indian cheese marinated. i wil come back for sure."
"delicious vegetarian dishes, accompanied with salted- and mango lassi. nice and subtle spicing. they are also very flexible (for example, minor changes in the menu). everything is prepared fresh so it will take a while before it is served. very friendly lady serving us."

"love the buffet from around the world!! food from europe to asia. the meat is fantastic and the quality of fresh food is great. love the idea of paying for your dining time rather than food items! if you are taking the kids make sure to get them to eat their main meal before they get to the deserts! one day we will go and just have dessert and no main meals as the choice is outstanding. very clean, great staff and good food. all in all a perfect place to eat and enjoy time with friends or family."
"came here for an evening with family and i have to say i was very impressed, not only with the layout and decor of the building (including the great bathrooms) but the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the service was amazing, the food tasted absolutely delicious, i would definitely come back here if i visit agai "
"we have eaten here sveral times, usually as part of a larger group of friends and always find the choice and freshness of food to be of a high standard, not always found in similar types of establishment. plenty of chinese, malaysian, thai and japanese varieties as well as pizzas and european dishes for those who do not like the spicier dishes. good teppenyaki grill and fresh wok cooking as well. can seat 100s!"
very cozy place if u want to try one of the best know  chines dishes then you should come here this is best quality
"we went there four friends in the end of a really long and good day - we didnt really have many expectations. when we first got there we were greeted by the extremely friendly staff - the price seemed high at first - but when we got to pick our dinner we realized how many options we had. all kinds of meat and vegetables and the experienced chefs prepare it right in front of you. all drinks and desserts are already paid for when you enter, so you can drink and eat as much as you wa "
me and my friends ate here and were extremely pleasantly surprised. the food was excellent and the staff even more so. very pleasant experience and the atmosphere were very nice and relaxin 
"as awe have dietary needs (shes vegetarian, both gluten-free and i am dairy-intolerant, we are a challenge to any jrestaurant. here we were welcomed with a smile, given a personal waitress to guide us through the buffet and the food was fresh, tasty and more than enough. definitely jthe best option we had in the area"
"fantastic good quality food, huge choice, very friendly, professional and attentive staff, clean, and great value for money. enough parking nearby,"
this wok restaurant is very good. youtube van choose different chinese food. tepanyaki grill pizza. dutch food. icecream desertbuffet etc etc
"we went ti this chinese restaurant today with our friends who live nearby. i can honestly say that i have never been to a chinese restaurant like this one. the rich decor instantly appealed, the extremely happy and kind reception staff made us feel so welcome . then we discovered that even though we paid a fixed price for a smogasboard, it entitled us to :- select anything we chose, even to having steaks including kangaroo, prawns, different fish etc all cooked especially for you. the range of different nations dishes was amazing and the deserts were to die for. the wait staff were diligent and always happy........i want to recommend this restaurant to everyone!"
a lovely spot for lunch al fresco; friendly staff who like a little dutch style joke and are happy to serve away. a light snack was just what was required and the apple pie desert was to die for - it became the benchmark for the rest of our netherlands tour - top class.
"clean, friendly and with enough greek atmosphere to make one feel one might be on holiday. good choice of food and drink.  excellent! we shall be coming back again and again and again..."
this is a very good restaurant. the food is authentic greek.  the staff is very friendly and the owner is very good host.
"even if the restaurant has only a dutch menu, the owner speaks english very well and can kindly suggest you the best of greek food. our dinner was good and tasty. i hope to come back soon."
we arrived just as the kitchen was closing (8pm which is quite early) but they agreed to feed  
a busy terrace. the waiter was very helpful and nice. my partner ordered biologisch beer which was excellent. chardonnay and bottled water was ordered. it was very peaceful on the terrace. the dishes served to our neighbours looked very well presented and appetitizing. we would have ordered lunch but had another appointment. definitely worth a visit.
"it was very good. i think that foto was enough. atmosphere was nice. staff was helpful, they ask all the time that everything is ok.  i recommend"
"my son booked high tea (or afternoon tea, as it is known in the uk) as a treat for me - and what a fabulous treat it was! we had a superb selection of savouries, pastries and cakes - all beautifully presented, and washed down with a selection of teas and a glass of prosecco. the service was spot-on too. 5 stars all the way!"
"the menu here is very typical, including croquettes, omelettes, pancakes, burgers, and a chicken sate dish. we had the latter too, and both were well portioned and quite decent quality wise. the main gripe we had was that the burger was extremely well-done, to the point of being a bit dry. with quality meat and a thick burger like that i would expect it medium, but at a minimum not d "
have visited this excellent restaurant on all of our frequent visits to leerdam and have always found the food to be excellent in choice and quality. friendly service and seasonal menus are always interesting!
"have you ever tried a glas menu? no?! then, you should try it in the restaurant t veerhuy "
"impromptu visit to t veerhuijs, wanted to take the family and some friends for some traditional dutch pancak "
"this is a very nice restaurant, helpful service and a good place to rest after a nice long walk or ride along the river linge."
"calm, relax place to a nice and warm meal. nice staff, good dinner and an vegetarian option that was very tasty!"
"booked for around 6pm, arrived 6.45pm. warm, welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. welcomed and served by anais, excellent waitress. wines very good, menu extensive and reasonably priced, i had two wild platter (venison and wild boar platter) portions more than adequate, plated exquisitely, enjoyed meal very much and so did my friends theirs. would highly recommend this lovely restaurant in leerdam, and leerdam too, known for its specialist glass ware. "
nice lunch place in old leerdam. the service was friendly quick and correct. i had a ni√ßoise salad and the tuna on it was freshly grilled and perfectly cooked. i was impressed so a big compliment to the chef. my friend had a goal cheese salad which was also very nice and well prepared. 
the 25 euro for the three course glas menu is a good choise. it gives good value for your money. the haeted terras is a
"charming place with nice vieuw. nice menu with great food. looks nice, taste even more!  good price/quality balanceüëç. perfect place to combine shopping in the mainstreet and finishing with a great dinner or lunch. also attractive pancakes for kids."
"we arrived a the restaurant and the menus were all in dutch. the waiter was pleasant, polite and offered to translate as necessary. the food was fast and tasty. loads of locals having lunch which was a great tell. would recommend it for lunch, snacks and coffees"
"very good traditional dutch cuisine and great value. very busy restaurant, brasserie style, quick friendly service staff all seemed to speak good english and the menu was varied, not too extensive and the desserts were delicious. a real find."
"we tried this restaurant as an alternative to our hotels excellent restaurant and were not disappointed. after studying the extensive menu (all in dutch so some interpretation is needed ) we had the set 3 course asparagus menu. well presented, full of taste, and filling, along with a carafe of house red, our meal was a most pleasant experienc "
"we spotted this restaurant when we were exploring this magnificent town. it looks great from the outside with a corner pub and an outside marquee attached. we opted for the outside marquee with wall heaters. unfortunately they dont do an english menu and their menu is quite extensive and uniquely dutch. however we got the very friendly and good english speaking waiter to explain things in detail. the food was magnificient and unique and delivered quite quickly really. the heaters can be a bit too hot if you are sitting under them. also be warned if you have a credit/debit card whether it be visa/american express or anything like that, most places in this town dont take them including this restaurant, so be sure to carry plenty of cash on you. you could quite literally come back to this place over a series of a month and get something different everyday from this menu that you like."
"dropped in because i was stuck in traffic, this happens a lot in the netherlands, and was immediately seated although they were bu "
"i visited this one lunchtime. it is a traditional dutch building with a conservatory style extension. the staff were pleasant, welcoming and spoke good englis "
"as far as chinese food is concerned, there arent many choices here in makkum. just the one. so, if in makkum i strongly suggest giving it a try. three of us went there for dinner, i had a large beer and the special #40 something (shrimp and frog legs). the shrimp were large and tasty. the frog legs were a bit small, but served their purpose. altogether the meal had a lot of flavors with the vegetables and spices. i would go again, but i would try a different entree. with a large beer and entree my meal totalled ‚Ç¨24.90, a bit pricey for what i am used to getting back in the states. a good meal, but i could eat cheaper elsewhere. if youre craving chinese, definitely go. if youre penny (euro) pinching, stay away. "
"we had a late dinner here and found it to be a nice experience. we were made to feel welcome right from the start and the menu was explained to us as we don‚Äôt understand dutch. i had the vegetarian special, a falafel wrap, and my partner had chicken skewers. it was all very nice and nicely presented by friendly staff. we would really recommend this restaura "
we arrived too early for the dinner menu but wished for a heartier repast than lunch. the staff agreed to cook us dinner and the bbq ribs were outstanding.   a great location beside a busy lick dating back to 1606.   highly recommended.
beautiful views from the restaurant with delicious food ay moderate prices. rooms are mediocre but the hotel beach is an excellent place to kitesurf... just be careful for all the windsurfers and restrictions applied at different times of the year.
"the ice cream is delicious, the different cone flavours make it even better, the home-made cakes are also really good, the lovely girls helping you are patient and have always a smile."
breakfast was simple and lovely. my son enjoyed his sandwich and my latte macchiato was delicious. very fair prices!
"it is ok√© you are in italy. delicious and it is all homemade. so many flavors, difficult to choose. addicted to the yoghurt/orange."
"hostfull, very good capucho, ice varietis huge and very tasty! this is the place, how to relax and discuss your for business encounters in private over a good cup of coffee! on a lovely summer evening the place is packed with customers!"
"we got light snacks for a family of four, for example, 4 (2 scoops) ice-cream, and two brownies but we got it only within 7 euros (city tax included)! they offer both outsides and inside seating preference within the complex and overall, we think its worth the money!"
"we came across this small tearoom in the strange shopping mall in amstelveen when looking for pet food. the restaurant is located in the kostverlorenhof, a small shopping mall with some good restauran "
"this little gem is definitely worth visiting! homemade gelato and chocolate plus a really great coffee to go with it! even though they lack good outdoor seating, they make up for it in excellent quality gelato. this place definitely beats da vinci‚Äôs and it is way less crowde "
"suddenly feels like eating ice cream and tried subzero gelato just because it is right in front of me while passing by.. and surprisingly turn out to be one of the best gelato i ever got in my life :d no jokes and no exaggeration!!! they even have gelato with matcha flavor and taste excellent too! all classic flavor are great! pistachio, raisin, coffee, and caramel salt.."
"we were passing by in the car one day and noticed this cafe had just recently opened. so we gave it a go. i have to say this place is great, the coffee is excellent plus their cakes are delicious my partner has the dadel cake and i have either the carrot cake or the red velvet and all are delicious and light. the ice creams too look amazing and are made on the premises. see ya soon"
attempt for quality is the prime effort of this new company beyond any dou 
this place is a great addition to the shopping centre with very tasty icecream! we often go to italy and this is good quality ice. you can also take out a box of 1 liter and this makes a good impression at a friends dinner if you bring it. we go there almost every day for a walk and a nice dessert.
the food was delicious and authen 
"we went there on a saturday evening with no expectations at all. we sat down at 17.00. it was obviously too early for this place, cause we were the only guests. we ordered some starters, the borani and a type of tzaziki were delicious. at around 19.00 the restaurant was totally full and the party started. service was slow but we had so much fun, we didn‚Äôt min "
"we went with our non-iranian colleagues. the food was great and on saturday nights they have live traditional and pop persian music which makes it very authentic to iranian restaurants. although we found the music a bit too loud. the staff are friendly and the kebab and stew dishes are very good. they serve a complimentary and tasty soup as well as berry juice at first. very stylish and nice if you want to go with work colleagues etc. prices are okay, more on the expensive side."
"cyrus de grote was recommended by a business contact and i have eaten there twice since it opened. the food is delicious, genuine persian cuisine and the staff is as warm and friendly as youd expe "
"great food, great setvice, great cocktails recommended persian restaurant in amatelveen. even persian khoroshts each week day!!"
the great and joyful experience in a persian (iranian) restaurant outside of iranüëåüèºdelicious food and good music. sometimes live music
amazing food. splendid ambience. personal service by the host. made our night. must visit if in the area or desire good authentic pakistani food in amsterdam
this is the best indian and pakistani restuarant which remind you your childhood flavour or you feel taste like home made food.
went with friends to this new restaurant they have the buffet very nice tasty indian food with lot of vriety soup.salads bbq mwar and veg currys and sweets
a grote pannenkoek is plenty for 2 for to take home  which i do.  the umbrellas are necessary this year as plenty of sunshine
on a lovely day its nice to sit outside at a table either sunny or under an umbrella. the spek pannenkoek  is as good as i remembered.
"great place, friendly staff and excellent pancakes. fresh teas (mint and ginger) also to be recommended. found this place on tripadvisor and don‚Äôt regret coming"
last day of our holiday and stop off on the way to the airport. our 2 pancakes were the best we had on this visit to the netherlands with plenty of filling. if have a small appetite then ask for a small pancake. the staff were very pleasant and the service was excellent. the restaurant can become very busy when the shops are open so plan your visit.
"the pancakes in this restaurant are unusual: two thin pancakes on top of each other. we had one with nutella (a lot of nutella!!!) which was very tasty. great! we had another pancake with bacon. very unusual because the bacon was baked separately and put in-between the two pancakes. by not baking the bacon together with the pancake, the taste is less than with the usual dutch pancake where the bacon and pancake are made together. the good point is though that the pancake is less fatty. so all in all a good experience. the service was good and the place serves tap water. prices are normal."
really good pancackes! and very good service! how it should be. friendly people who work  there and know how to do there job! you feel welcome and looked after.
"this is a great place. the workers are so friendly, the location is perfect, best pancakes ive ever had in my life. thanks for existing."
"the place has very nice and a wide variety of vietnamese food. it is really close to our house so we often go and order lunch there since it is delicious! not only the pho is amazing but also the curry and the lemongrass sandwich is definitely worth a try! i strongly recommend trying saigon at least once it is really good and has a very wide variety of food to choose from. we also have the membership card for this chain of restaurants which also including kyoto sushi make a very good mixture to get discounts in both places at the same time. the staff is also much friendlier now than it used to be. i see there are some very bad reviews about the staff there being quite cold and not apprehensive which is actually true but now the people working there are much friendlier, a bit slow though sometimes but they are much better ( i remember there used to be a lady who was complaining all the time and seemed quite unhappy with her job ) fortunately not like it used to be anymore. also i see people complaining about the pho being really hot, well it is actually what pho is, it is a soup and it is supposed to be served cold, you just need to wait for a bit and it will cool down. we will for sure go back very often."
"one of my favorite places for lunch. the lunch deals are actually awesome value for money. soup, sate and springroles are some of my favorites. the vietnamese ice coffee is such a treat!"
"it is so far the best asian restaurant.my husband and i always visit amstelveen for shopping or eating dinner.we had tried few restaurants,but this is so far the best.i had the viatnamese salad with chicken,prawn and beef.it was really good.highly recommended for summer.it has a good portion and very fresh.my avocado shake was also really good.my husband had the stir fry rice with prawn also full of flavor.they also had a good and fast service! i will surely recommendüëå"
"had a great lunch with my wife there. the food was excellent, it was served quickly and it was really good tasting. i loved the pho myself, and the meals were very acceptably priced. service was good, quick and friendly. the restaurant was full, and with mostly people of an asian background. this usually is a good sign for the quality of the food and the authenticity. my wife and i loved it!"
the restaurant serves authentic asian food which leaves your taste buds satisfied :)  i had amazing pork curry .. and still relish the taste and tenderness . must try .
"the farm is a great place for a relaxed day out and you can even feed the deer while youre there. if youre feeling hungry, their pancakes are really tasty and 1 per person is plenty to feel pretty full afterwards."
wow what an amazing place hidden in the forest. great pancakes.  lovely for families with childrens play areas and goats to feed.
this place around since 1857.   nice coffee offerings.   the pancakes are delicious and large enough to share.   a little off the beaten path but worth the effort.   counter type service but super friendly people.   reasonable prices.
"a friend brought us here and recommended they had good pancakes, there was 45 minutes for pancake but was worth it, pancakes were good. the area is good for children they have a playground but they ask children also order meals not just drinks"
"back in 2015 i lived in amsterdam and often went to the amazing amsterdamse bos ..my ex bf helped me to discover this place and i often came back since then....it s a beautiful spot into nature with some animals and a lot of seats to rest and enjoy the sourrandings! they are a self service restaurant if you need it or just a pancake spot,they have a wide .. i mean...wide choice of pancakes and the design inside is just pure beautiness!!! looks like an old farm full of vintage things!! so so nice,more than reccomended!!"
"a piece of history that hasnt changed.   tasty food and friendly service. i would recommend this place especially if you love pancakes.   there are also animals such as deers, peacocks and even a pony."
"this place seems a little remote and a bit difficult t get to without local knowledge and a bike.none the less it was packed. waffles waffles wafffles, all sorts. all very tasty i am sure. after the waffle a good bike ride back to amsterdam is essential to work off the calories."
"situated in amsterdam bos this a perfect place to take the kids and enjoy a great pancake . huge choice of tasty savoury and sweet pancakes in a very child friendly environment. after you have enjoyed your pancake there is lots to do for the whole family . enjoy the animals that live just outside the restaurant, go for a walk or a bike ride and even go for a swim in the lake . you can spend the whole day enjoying the outdoors at bos and you wont go hungry with this great pancake house close at hand ."
loved the farm! came across it by chance on the end of a long bike ride out of the dam. great buffet with crepes and sandwiches at reasonable prices lovely settting too on a sunny early summers day. loads of space and easy and quick service. very nice.
"lovely location within a forest with plenty of walking and bike trails. the restaurant is a former farm house with seating both inside and out. these are dutch pancakes which are delicious. many selections including plain, apple, and bacon, with either powdered sugar or cinnamon sprinkled on top. this is a self service restaurant. the prices are a bit hi "
this place was beautiful. it‚Äôs a nice stroll to get there and totally worth it. the pancakes were delicious. the best i have ever had. will 100% return if i am ever in amsterdam again.
"nice and authentic pancake restaurant located in a traditional farm house. a wide selection of affordable pancakes and fast service. i expected to be served at this restaurant, but apart from the pancake, all other food and beverages has to be picked up on a tray."
"very nice location in beautiful park , and tasty and huge pancakes)) i recommend with  apple whipped cream and cinnamonüëçüèª"
"we visited here with two small children and had a great time. there is a play area for the children where you can sit and watch them while enjoying your meal. i recommend sunscreen as the area is not shaded for the children. the pancakes were delicious, but we ordered four and ended up taking two home with us. one would have been enough for our two children. very good service and friendly staff. good for families. "
"the restaurant was quiet when i visited (because of the time of the year). the service was good and the cheese/ginger pancake was excellent. it is not indicated inside the restaurant, but please note that it is basically a self-service restaurant."
"no only is there an excellent selection, this is also a great place for kids parties. you can also organise a walk/tour for the kids with a bos wachter (forest ranger) before you meal. he will point out lots of wild life. my kids really enjoyed it"
just went there with the kids and had a small pan cake. really good and the surrounding was nice. the only negative thing is the planes fly over very very low. the rest is oke
"in the middle of the forest, greate place to have a lunch with your family. vast choice of pancakes with all possible flavours from jam to tomato with cheese, cherries, and much more. outside seating creates a great eating experience."
"plenty of pancake choice from savoury to sweet. suggest two people share two pancakes, one savoury and one sweet, so you wont drown in one flavour, and sit outside in the court yard."
"i have been here twice in one week and love the pancakes!! the farm is hidden in the forest which gives it a great quiet atmosphere. love biking in the area and grab a pancake as we got hungry. both tried savory and sweet, the cheese bacon and the apple are both to be recommended! even though it was 30 degrees outside the service was super friendly! look forward visiting this place soon again. "
"lovely outing for sunday, you can cycle (or walk) up to the boerderij meerzicht. we arrived just after midday, ordered our pancakes. as i already had several cakes this weekend, i went for savoury: vegetables, cheese and onion. there is plenty of choice for toppings: lots of fruit!"
great pancakes! in the middle of the park! with peacocks and reindeer! great place to  stop and hang out!
"this place has some animals, massive playground and many other things for kids. you can easily spend here a couple of hours. pancakes are ok + you have other standard dutch options (sandwiches, apple pie, etc). the place is huge, probably 200 seats inside and outside"
"we went on a sunday morning and by 1030 it was busy, and by 1130 it was packed. opens at 10, but dutch pancakes (pannenkoeken) were not available until 11. you can get coffee, espresso drinks, sodas, juice, and pastry before 11. order pancakes at the cashier after you go through the buffet to get pastry and drinks. we found the savory pancakes with cheese to be our favorite, but of course the plain with powdered sugar and the sweet/fruity ones were amazing, too. we have 3 smaller kids (9, 8, 6 years-old) and we had leftovers with 3 pancakes, so they are not small!"
awesome   this is our second time visiting but it was the first time that we could be able to get some food from here.
"this is an old farmhouse in th amsterdam forest, close to the rowing la "
this place is nicely situated in the amsterdam forest park both accessible by bike as well as car. you can relax and enjoy a pancake from their well-organized kitchen. the children can enjoy themself outside in the playground or with some animals. as parents you can relax and easily keep an eye on the kids as there is only one way out and no dangers.
"along with a friend we went for a walk in the park near the rowing centre, and looked for this farm/restaurant to have pancake "
my girlfriend and i were staying at the steingenberger airport hotel and decided to take a walk through amsterdamse bos since it was a short walk away from our hotel. we stumbled across boerderij meerzicht by chance and were sure glad of  
"after a tiring hike in the park or the rope park on the other side, this is a perfect place to sit back, relax and enjoy wonderful and tasty(and interesting) pancakes. they have a very good selection of salads and sandwiches. kids loved this place as the place had deers, peacock and kids could feed the deers! would highly recommend this place for its offbeat location, great food and family fun!"
"they make all sorts of crazy pancakes as you like- sweet, salty or both. they are exceptionally delicio "
"love this place, has to be the best pancakes by far!!!  huge selections.  in door out door seating, with play park for kids.  great day in the amsterdam bos!"
"love this pancake house in the forest! 100s of different flavours and toppings to choose from, lovely seating inside and out and great lil farm animals and play area for kids!"
"went here yesterday (28/5) and we had a pancake with bacon and cheese, the other apple and cheese. both are ‚Ç¨ 8,20 really really good. (i told the pancake baker!). for the kids theres a playground outside!"
healthy walk from the entry of amsterdamse bos approx. 4 km. when we reached the place it was right time to order fo 
"place was busy. it was sunday. had to wait an hour, but the pancakes were fabulous. it should have an estimated waiting time. the drinks or soft drinks were very dear, eg ‚Ç¨2:20 for a small bottle of fanta. and you pay for the toilet. very child and pet friendly. "
"this restaurant is so unique to a person from the states. it is situated out in the middle of a forest;-- parking is quite a distance from the front door. before you enter this family oriented restaurant, there is large playground for the kids to work up an appetite; there is a petting zoo present on the grounds as well a beautiful peacocks roaming the ground of the restaurant. there is quite a selection of old tractors present before you enter the front door that makes the art deco quite interesting. once entering this very large area restaurant, you go to the counter to place your food and drink order. they have menus in both english and dutch. we chose to go all the way to back of the restaurant so we wouldnt bother other guests. you have to get you bread and drink order at the self-service counter and you order your pancakes with the cashier. it is important to note they only have one kitchen but they always use clean utensils when preparing food for people on gluten free diets or have food allergies. they have a large list of pancakes on their menu. i had the bacon, pineapple, ginger pancake and my husband had the cheese and tomato sauce pancake. both pancakes were huge and out of this world. you only need one pancake to fill you up. the restaurants serves all kinds of coffees, hot chocolate, irish coffees, juices and mineral water "
"the location is in the green area, amsterdamse bos. its not only a pancake restaurant but its also a place where you can bring your kids too. there is a play ground for the kids and also seeing deer. a lot of choice of pancakes"
"i took my family for a cycle through the forest, they begun to feel the pang of hunger - and id heard storied about a pancake house in the middle of the forest. we found a bustling, lively place - filled with laughing children playing in the park and looking at the animals and in the centre, a dark wood ornate restaurant serving stacks of the biggest pancakes eve "
its my the best pancake place that i have been to. i like the chocolate pancake the best. its great for travelers  enjoy
"if you love pancakes, it is a must visit place with so many different options. the restaurant itself is in the middle of amsterdamse bos gardens so it makes it really beautiful amidst the woods. there are few domestic animals and peacocks roaming around. nice playing area for kids. definitely one can plan a picnic to the woods with some delicious pancakes"
"good pancakes, and a nice variety of sandwiches, snacks and desserts. if you call ahead you can even get pancakes for specialty diets (i.e gluten free . "
"on first impression, this boerderij is just another tourist place in the amsterdamse bos. however, don‚Äôt be put off. not only has this restaurant got the fine art of serving a vast number of customers sorted, but the food is also very good. we particularly like the pancakes here, as they are some of the best in amsterdam (and, yes, we have tried all of the top rated places in the centre and beyond). the meerzicht has plenty of room so if you are a couple or alone, you can get away from the excellent play area and the mountain of kids. however, if you do have kids, this is a great place. our 5 year old never wants to leav "
"if we hadnt rented bikes and been told about this place, a stopping point in our 26 km ride, wed never have known about it. we took the long way around so our lunch came with few kilometers to go and we could relax outside. upon arrival by bike, you can park your bike on the side where there is plenty of room to park bikes, then go inside to where you pick up a tray, find beverages, etc. and order from a long, long list of sweet or savory pancakes. they give you a plastic pager so you can go find a table until your pancakes are ready. we had a beautiful sunny day so ate outside in the garden. each of us had a savory pancake, then we shared a sweet one afterwards! great place. go if you can!"
"we had a very pleasant surprise in finally going there. pancakes are good and the place is great for children ! tips: order the pancakes at the counter / kassa directly. then give your bill to the kitchen, and dont forget to take in return a bipper, which will turn red once the pancakes are ready (we had to wait only 10 minutes). also, the place is only 2 minutes from the nieuw meer, which you can cross in taking the boat for 1 euro per person and 0.5 cents per bike - only from 15th of april to october from 11.00 to 17.00 on saturdays and from 12.00 on sundays. anyhow, great place, good pancakes and plenty of seats, so you dont need to wait. "
the pancakes are delicious and the selection is huge. they have a beautiful garden in the summer and warmer days and its great just sitting out to enjoy a few pancakes. the bacon with maple syrup is one of their most popular and was delicious. we also tried some fruity ones which were equally really good. if you go to the amsterdam forest then this is s must stop!
"nice old converted farm with some animals and plenty of play areas for children. food is ok, average priced. plenty of seating in & outside and nice farmy atmosphere. main attraction is that its very handy if you are spending time in the amsterdamse bos/goat farm or just a lunch destination with children."
i have gone to the pancake house numerous of times and will be visiting it again in the near future. the atmosphere is great being in the centre of the forest. plenty of outdoor/indoor seating. lots of choice on the pancake menu. perfect place for family outings as there are a lot of animals nearby to keep the kids entertained and a massive play are 
"this place is in the middle of amsterdamse bos, a great green area between amsterdam and amstelveen. to get in the restaurant is already a nice experience, since there are other restaurants in the park, but this one is in its hea "
"wonderfully situated in the amsterdamse bos its a great place to end a walk in the woods. they have a wonderful playground, big terrace outside, and looks like an old farm. very wide variety of the big flat pancakes, with all sorts of toppi "
"a beautiful place in the middle of amsterdam wood. a place of warmth, large sweet pancakes during the long cold days pf winter and early spring and a joyful colorful playground outside for the kids with many animals as well, so the experience is both in and outside. the inn itself has a lot of collections: animals, birds, dishes and plates and many curiosities which make the place a true delight to be there for children and adults alike. i have visited the place for 3 times and enjoyed it each time!!"
"this pancake house is right in the middle of the forest amsterdamse bos. its very popular with local families and their children. they have seating in side and outside and even though it usually very busy during spring and summer, there always seem to be tables available. they serve a large variety of pancakes and they are good. adjacent theres a playground for the kids to enjoy. weve been going to this place for many,many years and its still a treat."
the boerderij meerzicht has a wonderful old fashioned atmosphere. it gives you a true old dutch feeling. the pancakes or pannekoeken as the dutch call them are very tasty. you can watch them make your own special pancake. the menu is diverse with many pancake toppings to choose from. we enjoyed our eating out there.
"we rode our bikes from amsterdam city along the river then along tree-lined paths until we reached the amsterdam bos (forest). the ride we took was about 8 km one way. we all really deserved a pancake after that ride! the boerderij meerzicht seats about 300 people - either inside the pancake bakery or outside under the trees. the pancakes were just divine. we would recommend the bacon, cheese and pineapple one for a savoury experience, but the pancake to die for was the chocolate one. mmmmmm- mmmmmm yum "
most authentic and tasty indian food. great service and good atmosphere. true to the multicuisine concept and caters to all tastebuds!
really good food og servic 
"great food, fresh and tasty,always fully booked,  but thanks stuff for helping us to find table and enjoy our meals and holidays üòÄ"
"absolutely amazing place to visit for your dinner, tasty food, friendly stuff, i would highly recommended"
"excellent indian restaurant with a lot of south indian cuisines. loved the panipuri, kothuporotta, and the chicken(hyderabadi) and lamb biriyanis(awadi). it is located in a shopping center. nice staff and less waiting time. their rose and badam milk shakes were great."
arrived on a busy friday evening at 7:30pm without a reservation and the restaurant was full. made me a booking for 9pm. 
"it was a delightful experience having authentic indian dishes at tummy treats ! just reading the names of maharashtrian dishes like kolhapuri chicken , malvani curry made us feel so warm "
this experience was completely unexpected. meeting friends who live in amstelveen after years. alka and ankur took us to tummy tre 
"after many experiences which were decent enough around amsterdam, we found this relatively small place with fantastic indian food. as opposed to other restaurants serving cliche menus, tummy treats really offers a journey around india and a lot of rather unique dishes for the local dining stage "
i went with my partner to have onam sadhya at tummy treats and it was just delicious! you could taste that it was prepared with a lot of attention by the chef (raja - he is not only very friendly but clearly also very skilled!). we loved the meal and look forward to returning to this restaurant!
best indian multicuisine restaurant in amstelveen and in netherlands. variety of dishes from all regions of india. authe
"unbelievable! best tandoori dishes i have eaten in netherlands for over 20 years. chicken thigh meat pure meat no onions and capsican peppers. charred en spiced the way it should be. i am not a fan of biryani but the vegetable biryani was delightfull!! and most importantly an indian restaurant which serves southern indian food as well as streetfood. never came across an indian restaurant which serves idli sambar, panu puri and all variaties of indian style pancakes. just a great place!"
"this is an absolute gem of a restaurant! amazing and delicious food, coupled with excellent service. would highly recommend this place!"
i know there are lot of indian restaurants but there are not many restaurants which serve the south indian flavo 
the last view weeks we ordered delivery from  the italiaan restaurants in amstelveen area that deliver to our home and this one is the winner. tasty pasta and well made pizza. only negative is that the delivery took long but it was worthwhile the wait.
"we were staying across the road whilst on a rugby and whilst helping heineken boost its annual turnover we got a little peckish. this was a little gem of a place, great food and was happy to customise pizzas to accommodate our british pallet. really friendly staff and great food give it go. the waiter asked if we wanted garlic on the pizza, boy did we get it. made a good pizza in to a fabulous one !!!!"
"the atmosphere and food are very good.  staff is friendly and the child friendly. pizza, pastas, entrees with many choices.  quality of food and level of flavor has always been high."
"we enjoyed the food here, its very italian, tasty and very reasonably priced. pastas are good, meat as well."
"i wanted to go for a while now since i saw their menu. they have dishes which you won‚Äôt often find here in the netherlands. they have a lot of choice. i took the takoyaki and okonomiyaki, two of my favorite dishes! i like that they have a lot of options on the okonomiyaki and it was really good! maybe a bit pricey, but i certainly found it worth it."
a nice little japanese restaurant focusing on ramen soup. had a warm welcome on a cold and rainy night and a very good fukushima ramen soup with some yaki gyoza and draft kirin. it actually became the highlight of the day and now will be returning to my hotel with a good memory. 
upon entering you are welcomed by authentic small japanese restaurant type with loads of japanese manga to read. great food choises and tastes very good. recommended for any occasion.
"its the first time for me to visit here. i really think the best japanese restaurant in europe. very comfortable, very tasty. i wanna come here every day but unfortunately my visit is based on business trip from london "
"full of japanese clients.  japanese waiter (dutch chef, curiously).  not cheap, but worth it i guess for the food.  simple decor."
the closest to japan it could be in area of amsterdam . very nice food with all traditional stuff from all over japan.from ramen to fried octopus balls and japanese draft beer. lunch and dinner. but they are closed between 15.30 -17.00 o‚Äôclock. friendly stuff and delicious food. 
"if youre looking for your ramen fix, this is the place to get it. probably the best ramen you can get in the amsterdam/amstelveen area! side dishes are excellent too. i have tried the teriyaki salmon and the gyoza, both delicio "
"went here again for lunch and the service was good, nice people and good food. what do you want more. the range of ramen dishes was good and the speed of service also. all in all a good place to have some nice japanese food worth the trip!"
"we (family with two children) had a lunch here. during lunch there is limited menu available, but well enough choices and beautiful option "
"my boyfriend and i came to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. to our delight, the atmosphere is informal and 100% japanese (i‚Äôve been to japan and my boyfriend lived there) and there are shelves full of mangas on the walls, so while waiting we briefly flipped through the pages of some comics (they have a lot of classics, so kudos for this); the staff is all japanese and most of the customers t "
"i went yesterday night for dinner with friends to this cute family-run restaurant. a quite authentic small restaurant. they do not prepare sushi and it is not a fancy expensive restaurant. they offer ramen, friend noodles, japanese omelettes "
"the restaurant offers a nice and casual atmosphere. the front wall is lined with bookshelves full of japanese comic books to browse through. during the time of our visit, about half of the guests there were japanese, which is usually a good sign as it indicates authentici "
"authentic japanese food, the gyu don (beef rice bowl) and ramen noodles is very good. i have a pleasure time here."
local place cater for amstelveen japanese community. same like ramen places in japan  but cost twice. yet good to go for ramen and curry.
"the food is simple yet good. ramen tasted as expected. although it is a relatively small restaurant, the quantity of dishes on the menu is very large. perhaps too large, because the staff/kitchen seemed to have a bit of problem to get all the orders ready on time during a busy saturday evening. we had to wait 30+ minutes for a bowl of ramen and the staff mixed up the orders frequently. whether it was due too the busy evening or because some of the staff were new, we dont know. we will definitely visit again to see if it was a one-time fluke or n "
"rather basic looking cafeteria, but oh so authentic japanese dishes. dont come here for a romantic evening or go looking for fancy sushi or teppanyaki here, but enjoy sitting in the midst of japanese expats and eat what they eat. super friendly service, as one would expect."
standard service but the noodles are very good.  i always get the tan tan noodles and i have yet to be disappointed.  very satisfying place to eat.
"from noodles to rice and okonomiyaki, i never had difficulties to choose from the menu, well, there is just too much to choose from for one meal!!!! i have recommended to many friends who like japanese food, and it does attract local japanese customers every single da "
"i like the environment of the restaurant, there is a dutch staff who can speak nice japanese, with really nice serviceüòÄ the opener is also kind and friendly. the most important thing is - the ramen and gyuza are good! japanese green tea is worth to t "

"little small restaurant in amstelveen, the food was nice i have enjoyed.  you sit pretty comfortable, but its very busy."
"one of the few places in and around amsterdam where you can have some real tonkotsu ramen. the thick broth is packed with flavor and the pork is amazingly tender. you can order extra pork or extra noodles in case of bigger appetite. the menu offers a few other styles of ramen and lots of other dishes: fried chicken, fried noodles, rice dishes, gyoza, salads and okonomiyaki! ps: the latter takes around 30mins to prepa "
authentic japanese food with very friendly staff! the ramen is very good. also they explain everything to us. will come back again!
it is a nice and cosy restaurant run by japanese in amstelveen just a couple of minutes walk from the tram /metro stati 
"we were the only not japanese people in the restaurant, which makes me think that food is traditional and authentic.  all our dishes were amazing:  salads,  wontons, ton katsu, okono-miyaki.  i truly recommend."
"nice place, almost like a japanese neighbourhood living room, complete with magazines and other things to re "
"everything feels like japan in this place, the cook, the food, the client√®le. okinomiaki and other japanese homecooking are the way to go. food is value for money"

"we had a lovely dinner there. the atmosphere was very calm and comforting. the food was absolutely delicious, we ordered the chicken bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap (both are recommended). the waiter was very friendly, and he gave us recommendations (that we did order and really liked) and descriptions of the dishes. next time we come to the netherlands, were definitely coming back :)"
it was a lovely dinner experience with friends where we ordered bibimbap but with extra beef bulgogi with it. it was very delicious served in a hot stone bow 
"we had very good korean dinner here. very good food and tasty. very friendly waiters, and she can speak koreanüòä we had fried chicken pieces in korean style for starter, and it‚Äôs very good. also pork bulgogi with onion in chili sauce(recommend), you can choose with chicken too. we‚Äôre absolutely coming back again üòäthe best korean restaurant in townüòä"
nice atmosphere and great food. try the hotpot and the sake i tried out some korean restaurants in amsterdam but this one is far better
"great korean restaurant, also serving korean drinks. the food was amazing and they are very popular among koreans in the area which is always a great sign! highly recommended!"
lovely korean food for a decent price. especially the bulgogi was great. there were several korean business people when we ate there
"happened on this restaurant as it was close to our hotel. we had classic bipimbap, bulgogi and some nice insamul. kids want to come back tomorrow- that‚Äôs the best review you can get! authentic korean food and very friendly staff."
we had the surprise menu as i hadnt had korean food before so didnt know what to order. it was all delicious and prepared fresh. very friendly and helpful staff.
"damso was just smashing! the food is full of flavor and the spicy food really packs a punch (as advertised). additionally the korean bbq is far superior to other bbqs ive had, the meat is full of flavor and so rich that i struggled to finish everything (which is a compliment). service was fantastic, the young girl serving us was very sweet and treated us lovel "
been here a couple of times of the past years. i always leave satisfied. everything tastes good. my korean friends do agree. try the korean bbq.
"reserved a table for 3. restaurant not too busy, simple decoration. most of their guest were korean. food is good, especially the crab-pancakes. and the dipsauce was yummy. the dumplings and the chicken(korean style) was ok. but the dak kang djong was very good. bimbimbap was alright, the side dishes were a bit on the small side for three. but general was good. the service is a bit slow, had to call everytime for drink orders and she didnt cleared any empty glasses or bottles from the table. missing some hospitality. "
"we were eager to have hot asian food after taking some pictures of the tulips in the spring rain. excited to have found this on g-map and soon confirmed we were right when we saw authentic koreans running this cozy restaurant near amstelveen. choices on the lunch menu are not abundant but it covered all i could recall for a good korean meal: bim bim ba stone-bowl stirred rice, kimchi pancake, soup chilly tofu, soup noodle, etc. most of the customers spoke either korean or japanese, only a couple of dutch. atmosphere was casual and friendly, as the restaurants name suggests: friendly chat, which makes you want to stay longer after the meal. we waited but not too long for the stone bowl rice which was really nice in the cool spring noon. ingredients are very fresh and nicely presented. kimchi pancake is nice but not particularly unforgettable type. staff is more like family business style and do not expect very flattering service. maybe you need to be a little proactive, to remind your ordered drinks or prickles etc. price is fair for eating in a decent restaurant like damso in ams. will come back when i miss bim bim ba."
"delicious korean food, many choose on the menu. good value for lunch set and not too expensive for dinner as well. causal place. smelling a bit of table next to you order bbq meat. great place if you like korean quality food."
"buzzing korean restaurant with plenty of choices. we had a jellyfish salad starter, which proved to be quite different than imagined and very nice. then we shared a korean beef grill, which was fun and very tasty, and a spicy chicken and rice dish, which was hot! this came with plenty of yummy sides, so we left sated but keen to return. excellent service. "
my husband and i have now lived in amsterdam for 7 months and still have been on the hunt for a good authentic korean restaurant - now weve found  
"the first impression stepping into the restaurant it is not the best one ever, but the food is delicious. it was our first time with korean food and we liked it. everything is fresh and with good portions. mind only that they have only chopsticks for eating ;)"
"damso is a very nice small restaurant in amstelveen. we enjoy both - a cozy, friendly atmosphere and very good korean meals they ser "
"coming here regularly, traditional korean restaurant. food is very good, service is very friendly. i had tried half from the menu and all is good. dont look for the cozy or romantic atmosphere, its a simple restaurant and the value is all about food. they are open for lunch then re-open for dinn "
"this small restaurant in amstelveen is a bit like a home away from home, always full of locals (ie korean guests), which is always a good sign. food is fabulous and service very friendly, we always go there as family and are never disappointed. reservations are highly recommended. "
this restaurant is a gem because it is one of the few places in the netherlands where you can get authentic korean food. not suitable for people who dont like spicy food or dont like kimchi and other heavy tasting cabages. especially recommended for a bit larger group of people since in this case you can sample from the very many authentic korean dishes. see my pictures for some of the delicacies we tasted the last time i was there. for drinks i recommend the soju barley wine and the corn tea.
dont bother the interior but the food is all well. always a very nice welcome by the hosts. just a lovely resto.
"small cozy korean restaurant located in the old part of amstelveen. this restaurant serves some nice traditional authentic dishes. staff is nice and helpful if you have difficulty making a choice. various side dishes, like kimchi, will be served with the main cour "
if you are in search of a good korean restaurant in the amsterdam area then just go to amstelveen and eat at damso! food is very authentic and tasty with all the traditional bbq dishes rice dishes and kimchi. the atmosphere is casual so no need to dress up. and there are koreans working there which is nice to know. definitely go and you will get. nice meal! 
tastes of the foods in damso are really like the original. especially mandoo is really good.
the limoncello ice/gelato can not be beat.  street parking only so keep hunting for a spot.  lines are long on the sunny days
you can see long queues on a weekend inspite of the corona sca 
"its famous , its good, its deserves a visit   its a great experience with an open sitting area and yeah free parking"
ice cream is gre 
the place is very nice and offers a variety of tasty ice cream. my family loves it so much and we are frequently there.
"this is the hot spot for ice cream in amstelveen. in spring, summer and autumn this place is crowded with visitors of all ages who enjoy the many flavors of this authentic italian delight."
"slightly out of your usual way, da vinci offers generous portions of ice-cream. they have so many flavours that it is best to orientate yourself first online before cycling down to the lindelaan. the salon has a good selection of both sorbet and milk based flavours and - good news for those allergic to milk - a lactose free pure chocolate ice crea "
"if you love a perfect chocolate sundae, order this place‚Äôs superlative dame blanche.  consistently rewarding!  would go outta my way to enjoy one here."
the very best ice cream i have had in a very long time.  and their espresso is also a must.  the choice of flavours is huge and it‚Äôs all fresh right in front of you.
every summer we visit the ijssalon da vinci... it is the best in town and serves very innovative flavors which you don‚Äôt get at other place. very authentic gelato - home made and served fresh.
the gelato is really good and authentic. portions are large and priced fairly. good selection of flavors. overall definitely worth a visit!
there is so much to choose from that it takes some time to decide on the flavour. be ready for a long queue in a warm summer afternoon or evening but it is worth it!
it a nice spot in a convenient location. good ice cream lots of flavours that you would expect from italian ice cream. but for something south american try patagonias in the same neighborhood.
real fresh and smooth icecream. regularly new and innovatieve flavours. open in summer untill 22:00! it‚Äôs absolutely worth visiting.
the icecream is amazing quallity!!! good prices. they also have coffee. i recommend the flavour  kinder bueno.
"lovely ice, good taste, friendly staff.  now and then a bit crowded, but that ‚Äòs because they‚Äôre so succesfull.  worth a visit"
on a warm summer day head over for a gelato or ice cream. while there is always a line this is a locals favorite. parking once again is street parking and a bit of a challenge. yes there will be a line but get in it and have a memorable icy treat. there are outdoor tables and no one will rush you to finish.
"all lot of choice, friendly people behind the counter, you can sit inside and outside that says enough :-)"
"this place has a continuous stream of visitors on a sunny day, a rainy day and even quite late at night . this can only mean one thing : it is good . it is simply an ice cream parlour that makes on the premises and sells to eat there and then, grab a cone and go or even buy 1/2 litre to disappear and eat in secret . the flavours range from traditional to typical dutch to just plain lovely and ones you have never tried before. a must visit ."
"great ice cream ! love the cheese cake ice cream. dont like the whip cream, but luckily you do not have to add that ;-) easy to park your car in front. also next door is a great barbershop, jan bartels."
"this shop makes his own ice cream in lots of strange, but great tastes. like oreo/vanilla or white chocolate. grandmas cookies or cookie dough with grapes....so for every tast there is a variety of ice creams."
this the best ice cream parlor in amstelveen and vicinity. we live in amsterdam and even make the trip out of town to this place. so much better than all the prefab ice cream places in amsterdam. worth a detour!
i live near the place! the ice cream is great there! you should visit it! they sell things that no other ice cream shop offers!
"often i come to the hairdresser jan bartels, the best guy in amstelveen. i expected a long line for his services. no, it is the neighbor: da vinci icecream parler. in one word wonderful genuine ice cream for a decent price. unfortunately closed during the winter, but i cant wait for the spring to coem. go there!!!"
excellent ice cream and sorbets. ambiance is good. service is ok. a lot of real italian flavors. great spot. the place to be in summer !
"whatever ice cream you want, they have it. huge assortment of all kind of ice. expect a cue when its warm."
"our benchmark is pistach/ pistacchio. i eat that all over the globe. if i leave most gelaterie in rome, palau, salerno, napoli, pesaro, milano etc etc out of competition than da vinci has made the dramatic quantum leap to the first place in amsterdam ( sorry pisa, you were our favorite) of the netherlands, munich, london, new york, barcellona. "
"nice selection of flavours, friendly personnel, always busy. love to visit the place after dinner! recommend."
"does what it says on the tin. great tasting ice creams in a nice parlour . we just has double cones one a hot day , busy but found a space to sit easily. good value"
people know italian ice cream is famoes. da vinci ice-cream parloer is absolutely one of the best  i know. young women and men serve you well. you can get a lot of different tastes.
"best ice cream in amstelveen. not open the whole year, usually they close beging october and open again in march. really good ice cream and not even expensiv "
its the best ice cream in amstelveen. they have various kind of ice cream. and every time they make some special flavour. and its home made. everyday fresh ice cream. and always busy during summer time. be ready to wait üòâ
"we love the shop. all kinds of flavors, they the classics ones and new/experimental ones. they have now pokemon ice!  it is always busy. but they work hard so you never have to wait long."
"we live around the corner from this place so we go here every week. however, this review is not positive because of the proximity. even compared to top ice cream parlours in italy, da vinci holds its ground and is better than most of what we have tasted over there. they regularly change up their flavours and experiment with new ones. but they never forget their classics and consistently stay at the top of ice cream parlours in the amsterdam area for sure. come and try it out yourself!"
dont let the simple looks and the location of this very good italian restaurant hold you back to visit this very good italian food restaurant. the high quality justifies largely the slightly above average prices. it looks like an ice cream parlor but it is also a restaurant. friendly service and original italian food from the old school.
"nice spot, busy on sunny days, but never a really long wait. long enough for us to choose between all the tempting flavors.  worth a small detour. but not extremely different from many other quality italian ice cream shops."
great choices of flavours and all very yummy! visit this place quite regualrly and always lovely ice cream. love the snickers and bueno flavour!
amazing choices of ice cream. i loved the pistachio flavor. but you could also get some more creative flavors. english speaking staff. all very friendly.
"super nice and delicious gelato! usually there are small queues here in summer. quite some variety, very good prices and great quality gelato."
all i can say is: try it for yourself! this shop has some wonderful italian flavored icecreams. kids will love the blue flavored smurf ice cream. shop has indoor and outdoor seats depending on the weather. once youve tried you will be back for more!
"we tried davinci recently as our favorite icecream shop has closed. we were in for quite a surprise! there are many great flavors to choose from, with a new favorite for me: toffee fleur de sel. we ordered an orea ice cream cake for my daughters birthday party, which was great too. the top had a chocolate icing which had a bit of a strange texture, but overall everyone thought it was a hit. we will definitely go back."
plenty of flavours to choose from and on sunny days you will have to queue up. really good ice cream.
"i am originally from amsterdam and i used to go to an ice cream parlor in amsterdam-south which i still believe has the best ice cream i ever had as they use fresh fruit in their ice creams. but ijssalon da vinci comes close though. i took my three grandsons (age 15,14 and 10) here for an ice cream. and living in the usa (chicago area) they are supposedly connaisseurs with regard to ice cream. they have tried virtually all brands of ice creams in the usa, both when visiting ice cream parlors (dairy queen, baskin robbins, you name it) as well as ice cream brands from the freezers in various super markets. and they rated ijssalon da vinci very high, so i guess this is a good recommendation. try and judge for yourself. enjoy!"
i dont know what ijssalon da vinci do but whatever it is it is good. the best icecream i have ever had no matter which flavour you pick it is always good. when i used to life in amstelveen in summer time i would stop by here at least once a week.
"good taste of the different flavours, we tried melon, monchou, greek yoghurt with passion fruit and strawberry cheese cake. great value for money in comparison to the other italian ice cream places!"
"judging by the often long queues, one expects somthing special and, while the ice cream is generally good, it isnt quite top ... and some flavours disappoint, such as the pistachio.  nevertheless, not bad for a cheerful ice cream parlour in a periferial amstelveen neighbourhood."
da vinci has great italian ice cream. lovely tastes. its a bit on the outskirts of amstelveen but definitely a reason to drive a few kilometers more. try the oreo taste of bitterkoekjes.
"the ice cream is so good and diverse that the place is so popular you almost always have to queue, even 22.00hrs. if it is a sunny day and you find yourself in the neighbourhood it is definitely worth a visit !!"
"da vinci has a wonderful selection of great ice cream. period. yes, you may encounter long lines on sunny days, but its worth the wait."
this is the best italian ice-cream place in town. wide range of flavors to choose from and very tasty ice-cream.
"not expensive, loads of flavours.  has an american sort of attempt about it (apart from the staff, of course).  outdoor seating available."
"we werent overly hungry but knew we didnt have anything to eat in the house, so we kept an eye out for somewhere on our way home. i would have driven past it, thinking it was a pub, but then spotted the name. we popped in and had some very tasty tapas - a fish and a meat platter. we all had our favourite bishes, but really they were all very good. the two dishes filled up two adults and a teenager, but like i said we had been nibbling all day. i would happily go back for the same, or try anything else on the me "
on a bright day after a tough cycle against the wind this charming and friendly bistro fuelled me for the next leg of the trip. as a solo diner there was just the right amount of friendly interaction with the team. the cheese and tomato toasty was much more than that. the coffee was excellent too. the church nearby is a masterpiece.
"the biefstuk was great, really well made coupled with an excellent tomato soup and terrific tostadas"
driving along one of the main routes out of amsterdam area and there was a traffic jam so my friend who is dutch found an alternative route and we drove through this small village and decided to stop for dinne 
"we went to this place on a sunny late afternoon and used a local supermarkets two-for-one deals. we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who was a delight all the way through. we ordered wine and beer and were immediately offered bread and butter spread. the starters were quite good, albeit not too spicy. the mains were nicely presented and were quite tasty, the gambas could have been cooked a bit less, other than that it was a nice meal. as a desert we had an apple pie in which tortillas were used as layers, a funny twi "
"the location is lovely and very peaceful.  the staff is kind and helpful. the ribs my boyfriend had were excellent. i would rate the steak i had as average, however it was plated up and presented very nicely."
"so bad, reading the comments of someones before me. with even just lies in it. well, of course, they have toilets. and very clean on "
chose to eat here when staying nearby. never had an indonesian before but the menu had english and restaurant had tables. staff were immediately friendly and the food was excellent. good value too as lots of food.
"...at typically inflated amsterdam/-lveen prices. nice setting though and friendly service, if a bit slow to come and take (and remember) our order with a full house. bereft of indonesian cuisine in tallinn, estonia where i live, i took my go-to dish of chicken satay, which was nicely cooked and very flavourful without being too heavy or oily. it was served with some lovely, slightly sticky rice. sides were pickled everything, which were nice. the noodle, rice and beef dishes my fellow diners had were all enjoyed, as were the mixed vegetables with coconut. overall a pleasant dining experience which came to about ‚Ç¨35 a head including drinks (soft drinks/beer only). clearly popular, even on a sunday night - we got the last available table, which just happened to be available, so you may be better off booking if you really want to try the place."
i returned a year later to this excellent restaurant and the owner recognised me and greeted me like a long lost frie 
when it comes to lemon grass i have mixed opinions about it. overall its good ambiance with indonesian dishes to choose from. perhaps good for a visit.
"we had an indonesian rijsttafel for 2 which was delicious! we ordered sat√© kambing extra and that was better than ive ever had in the past. really good, genuinly indonesian food. the staff was very friendly and helpful and took excellent care of us! certainly a place we will go back to!"
"my friends and i did not really order anythig in particular, we let patron pick dishes hed like to share with us....and that worked wonders. indonesian cuisine has a history in the netherlands, but this place is real outstanding."
"an indonesian friend organized this outing for around 10 of us. instead of having to choose from the menu, we had arranged for the kitchen to just feed us! what a great decision. dish and dish after dish of stunning indonesian food just kept coming. our indonesian friend confirmed that this was the real deal. the service was superlative. however average this place looks like from the outside, i cant recommend it highly enough. a wonderful experience enjoyed by our whole party. also great value for money - huge meal, drinks, dessert, at under 30 eur per head."
had dinner here with my marine corps friend and we always like to eat some indonesian food. i am borne and raised in indonesia so i know what indonesian food should be li 
very good food and service.  the rijsttafel is the most delicious indonesian food i have ever tasted.
"my wife, who is from holland, and i have been coming to holland almost every year for 45 years to visit very good friends and her family. we love indonesian rijstafel, so our friends suggested we try lemongrass. it was an excellent recommendation. lemongrass is a very modern and fairly small restaurant, recommend reservations. the service was very good. our party of five all had mini rijstafels and we all enjoyed the food very much. looking to eat here again when we return next september."
visited the restaurant quite a few times now since it opened. the the rijsttafel lemon grass is always good. if you go with friends 3 times rijsttafel is more than enough for four persons. so go and have a nice dinner!!
"we used to eat rijsttafel in amsterdam, but service and quality just went down too much recently. lemon grass is exactly what we were looking for: very tasty food nicely presented by friendly waiters. as a bonus, it was much cheaper than in amsterdam, but thats not what we were looking for, it was quality we were after and with that we were more than happy."
"we booked on line and enjoyed a very good meal on a busy saturday night in early jan. we ordered the lemon grass reistafel which for 3 of us provided more food than we could finish , and a variety of dishes ( about 10) with 3 side dishes with different levels of spiciness . the service was pleasant , but as mentioned in other reviews the dining area is quite small but i think the price reflects th "
"first time here but i enjoyed it very much. this is a small place that can hold some 35 people or so. as this is a small place the tables are a bit close to each other but it is still ok. nice utensils and linen napkins are on the table. we started with some complimentary prawn crackers and indonesian beer (bintang). the menu has a variety of dishes with chicken, lamb, beef and fish so there is choice for everyone. we started with the pangsit goreng (5) which is a deep fried wonton filled with a prawn/chicken filling and udang goreng (2) which is a large deep fried shrimp. very nice. for mains we had the spicy dengdeng blado which is a dried spicy beef with lots of ginger and in a nice hot oily sauce. really enjoyed this with the white rice. the other main dish was the ajam panggang which is a grilled chicked that really gives you some charcoal flavors. to add some more taste to it we added the atjar tjampur which is sweet and sour vegetables. it was a good experience and it would probably be good to make reservations before you go. by the time we finished our meal the place was full."
"we had diner here because all other restaurants we tried were full. in this small restaurant we got a friendly reception (also our little dog was welcome). we had babi ketjap and sajoer lodeh. both were very good. as desert we had the tjendol, which we did not like since the green sustance tasted nasty floury. although we did not like the tjendol, the rest was so good that we will come back lateron."
one of the joys of visiting the netherlands is the opportunity to sample indonesian cuisine and our dutch hosts recommended this restaura 
we recently went here with frien 
"located in the stationsstraat, in the oude dorp (former center of amstelveen) this is a different kind of indonesian restaurant: not a toko with take-away but a true restaurant. tasty, affordable dishes and friendly staff. will definitely return and warmly recommend it!"
"excellent quality food and service in tasteful modern-design-ish atmosphere. especially nice broad choice of different rijsttafel dishes. we combined two smaller ones with some starters which allowed a very nice palette of tastes. service was perfect, attentive but not intrusive, food came quick, a jar of water was served without asking. perfect dining highly recommended."
"had an amazing rice taffel which although a dutch invention is something i love for sharing with family. lemon grass amstelveen do a 16 dish delight with a wonderful mix of sweet, sour, spicy, salty, savoury dishes with soya, prawns, fish, chicken, lamb and beef as well a vegetarian version. they even had a kids menu. it was a wonderful combination and the food and rice kept coming. certainly no one went hungry that night. the waitress was attentive, helpful and accommodating for our party of 15 people and there were no grumbles on the tale. highly recommend it!"
this is a great little place. nice food and good sized portions.  limited drinks menu but that was ok for this type of place.
"we were just back from a wonderful vacation in indonesia and already yearning for some authentic fare. i heard from a friend that this place served good food so decided to give it a shot. wasnt disappointed, great food and service. the restaurant is tiny so suggest reserving ahead just to be safe."
"in the past it was a thai restaurant therefore the name and interior however the food is authentic indonesian, not like the chinese indonesian rijsttafel. we enjoyed with a big group of friends a whole range of dishes and each had that nice oriental aroma. the taste is good and you could ask if you wanted it more spicier the original way. try it out and ‚Äúselamat makan‚Äù."
"great little family run vegetarian restaurant specializing in pizza and pasta, kosher.  we had pasta and salads and they were fresh and tasty. service and staff very professional but at the same time they make you feel like family."
i ate several times in pizza&co. the pizzas are very tasty and both greek and tuna salads are excellent and fresh. good pleasant atmosphere and you can sit both inside and on the nice terrace. highly recommended and certainly worth a visit.
"came here for both of our lunches while in amsterdam. pizza was outstanding...personal margaritas. limited seating, but great option for a quick lunch.  fries good as well."
"this isnt the worlds best kosher pizza. but its tasty, not too expensive and easy to get to. we took the metro and walked about 10 minutes. there are a few tables, but when we got there we were told that a big group was on the way in and wed have to eat elsewhere. that was fine because there are lovely benches outside."
small kosher pizza shop located a small shopping area beneath apartment houses. pizza is sold by the pie not by the slice. only few tables.
we always enjoy the delicious pizza and chips friendly service and served quickly easy to find took a tram and bus from centraal station and it‚Äôs kosher which helped me
"a great kosher pizza place in the middle of amstelveen - good pizza with all the topings included and fair price, very homey and not-too-much-israeli vibe to it, you can approach the owners in hebrew if thats your thing in kosher places but they much prefer english or dutch."
we really enjoy pizza. taste was good and fresh ingredients. they do also falafel and fries so really its a nice place if you wanna avoid your typical restaurant. they also serve desserts. kashrus its ok chalav isroel.
"me and my wife enjoyed the great food there. we werent expecting too much from a kosher place, since usualy, kosher food abroad is more expensive, but not realy good compare to resturants in israel with similar price range. but this one cought us by surprise. reasonable prices and a very dellicious pizza. also, i got falafel, with was good too, but the pizza was the highlight for me."
"when i wrote my review in 2018 i couldn‚Äôt expect that i would only visit again in 2023, however we were pleasantly surprised with food being even better than in 2018. the flavours of the dishes were absolutely wonderful. the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala were delicious. our next visit will not take as long as last time."
"the indian kitchen is an awesome indian restaurant. it has good ambience, very smiling and hard-working staff. the staff specially nidhi has been extremely professional yet friendly. the food is quite apt and reminds you of the great indian taste. for me this place is a great place to bond with my colleagues, customer and of course, my family. it feels at home outside home and you will not miss india, away from india. the entire dining experience is quite aweso "
"the food was excellent and the service was exquisite. the ambiance was good.  we found this on trip advisor, and we were not disappointed."
"some of the best indian food ive eaten, and i do eat it often! i live abroad, but i visit the netherlands regularly, and the indian kitchen has quickly become a regular must every time. just be careful on the spicy! it is really spicy. luckily the kind waitress was smart enough to suggest going for medium and not hot... i thought i could take it! great food, nice place, good service!"
"in a casual and comfortable but stylish environment (love the art and imported wood panels), this is the best indian cuisine i have had in a long time if not ever! every dish was perfectly executed, authentic and well seasoned, hot and fresh to the table; specifically the butter chicken and samosas were absolutely divine. and the service was not just friendly but really on top of it as well. great family restaurant but solid for clients and business associates too. "
the food is amazing! best indian restaurant! service was also very good! it is a must visit indian restaurant!
"very nice food, excellent service. spicy or less spicy, just how you like it, just tell them how you want it. been here more than once, will surely come back."
"visited this restaurant again last night for the first time since the pandemic and had another great experience! we had samosa, onion bhaji and these great little chicken stuffed naan breads to start. i could just eat the little naan breads all da "
"authentic place and music, friendly staff, great beer but most importantly the food was amazing. probably the best indian food i ever had."
"great variety of food, prepared in an excellent way. the service is impeccable and it had a great separate bar and outside terrace"
"everything was excellent and service was great we tried biriani , prawns, chicken curry. very friendly staff. we highly recommend"
we have travelled and we have eaten. and then we came here... the bar has been rais 
great food and lovely atmosphere. would visit more often if we lived nearer to amstelveen. highly recommend you give this place a try.
the indian kitchen has a lovely ambiance with a large tv screen rolling beautiful photos of india. the food served was excellent. the staff was very friendly and the food was out in a very reasonable time. a great place to host your guests! will certainly eat here again.
"our dinner was amazing and all of the food was excellent. the service was great and so was the atmosphere. if you want to eat indian in amsterdam, this is definitely the place to go!"
we went for a dinner after making a reservati 
"i was at indian kitchen last night and it was - yet again - a really lovely meal. we had lamb tikka and an amazing potato and paneer stuffed pepper to start. then we had chicken tikka, a prawn biriani and a lovely cauliflower side di "
"been here now a couple of times for dinner and its good quality every time weve been here. service is quick. you make a reservation online and this way you also dont need to fill out forms when you arrive. hand disinfecting gel at the door before you go in and all seating areas are shielded off from each other. joyful starters such as the spicy chicken wings and samosas. main dishes will be prepared from mild, medium and hot but if you ask for scorching hot they will make it to your liking. all dishes we have had over time are really well done and tasteful. whatever is left you just take home. as a nice closer we typically have the old monk which is the indian rum that is really good. we try to go here every week and well keep doing it!!"
"lovely food! it was al perfect.. servis and food matches the quality üëåüèºüëåüèº recommended for sure, very friendly staff"
"highly recommended! the food is excellent quality, the staff is super friendly and the ambiance/decor is lovely. on top of that the price is very reasonable! all in all a great restaurant."
ambience : 4/5 food : 5/5 service : 4.5/5 taste : 5/5  authentic indian food. must try murg haddiwala
"great indian food with authentic flavours. a lot of options, all nice. the restaurant itself is nicely decorated with dark colors and indian artistic pieces. outside a big terrace. location is al little of the grid, but worth going. highly recommended."
great bengal food. their hyderabab lamb biryani is top. tandoori prepared dishes are top. excellent service.
"a beautiful restaurant that brings you diffrent tastes of india. they give high service and high quality food. good for eating with the family, friends or after work!"
i have been to both indian kitchen restaurant and indian street food several ti 
"the kitchen is my favorite indian restaurant in amstelveen.. the hospitality of manu, prateeksha, vishal & rest of the staff is great. food is not oily, prepared well & tastes well too. don‚Äôt worry about a delhi belly!! after 5 years in nl & numerous visits to this place... it feels like an extended home when i visit. "
the atmosphere is welcoming. the interior very nice and elegant. the food is delicious. we are always happy to have dinner here.
great choice and not an absurd portion size that guilts you into finishing as with a lot of other indian restaurants. butter  chicken was awesome and
"we already been here a few times, we like the variety of the the menu, although onion-bhaji is not on the menu, you can still order it as a shared starter, this combined with each a main-course is usually enough for us. the staff is friendly, but sometimes a bit to young to have proper horeca experience. the cocktails are really good, however it takes very very long to make them, which is a real pitty. be aware if you don‚Äôt like cold wind, then avoid sitting next to the kitchendoor or under the aircounit. but for the taste of india this is a must go! "
"modern interior design though very tasteful dishes as i could experience. excellent tikka lamb, loved the rice. be mindful medium spicy is truly spicy for taste buds if one is an occasional  indian food eater. found the bottle of water truly expensive (5 euro)."
a vast variety of delicious indian food. good place for family dinners.   vegetarians also have a vast variety of dishes to order from.
very authentic tasting indian food served in a fairly modern manner and setting. depth of flavour and fresh herbs very present. service prompt and pleasant. would go out of my way to return.
the food service was quite fast and good. the served food were fresh and tasty. we had a good time here. the ambiance was also quite pleasing. recommended !
"although the restaurant is located in a very standard amstelveen street, that is forgotten the moment you step through the doo "
"very good, tasty food with fresh ingredients, which i always enjoy, served by friendly staff and for reasonable price.  you will taste the original kitchen from india in a restaurant with a good atmosphere. cheers"
the restaurant is packed. the food is fantastic and authentic. the restaurant is having the north indian modern vibe. seats are comfortable.
"love it, love it, love it. fantastic staff, friendly management, kind and polite.  on top of that, food is really great. tasty, well seasoned and portions are solid regardles if you have in the restaurant or take away -  always best quality. strongly recomend!!!"
"the service is great, the food is tasty and the cocktails go down smoothly. careful with the spicy options. this is not western st "
been here with my indian family and ate delicious authentic tasting indian food. best chicken tikka masala with naan i ate outside india and finaly it truely was spicecy and real indian taste. the daal and paneer was also excellent. we will come again soon!!
"the three of us ate here twice in one week. yes, it is that good! authentic menu with quite the selection. we enjoyed a few street food appetizers before getting into the traditional dishes of the home. between the two nights we had the following entr√©es lamb rogan josh, chicken bariami, chicken butter dish, prawns, tandoori chicken, lots of basmati rice and different kinds of naan. everything was served family style overheated plates. the restaurant has a full bar. the owner is quite visible and the waitresses are very attentive and pleasant plus helpful as you try to make choices between the many entr√©es. i am one of the entr√©es favorites were the lamb and the tandoori, but all were grea "
"we had a yummy meal here in early august 18. after three weeks in london, copenhagen, brugge & amsterdam was craving for indian high quality home food. the food at indian kitchen was simply amazing. yummy. finger licking. the ambience was superb , staff very friendly plus very reasonably priced too. strongly recommended. pradeep multani, new delhi. india"
"we have been eating here since the place started out as a take-away place. i am glad that their quality has stayed the same. we order from here often and also, go and dine in when we have guests that want to have indian food. the quantity in take-away is a lot more than when you eat there but the options available in the restaurant are a lot mo "
"called in after reading a comment on trip advisor had one of the best curry dishes i‚Äôve ever had , coming from yorkshire where we have some of the best curry houses in the country , i think that speaks for itself highly recommended"
we always get take away from here. it is delicious and we enjoy it every time. great flavor and the price is about the same as any amstelveen restaurant. its cheaper to take away to avoid the cost of drinks and we enjoy eating at home relaxing with this great food tasting the wonderful spices and sauces.
"we went for dinner, service was good, food tasted go "
"it is our second time at the indian kitchen, and it never disappoints. this is a sophisticated indian restaurant that could well be in amsterda "
"this is one of the best restaurants me n my husband has been too. the service is more then fast. within 20 minutes of placing order , the food is on your table. the spices and the taste is to die fo "
"one of the best indian restaurant in amsterdam(or i should say amstelveen). quality of food is great and also the ambiance. prices are very little higher when compared to other restaurants in amsterdam. but it is worth for the quality of food they serve. i have visited the restaurant couples of times(¬±6 times) and have tried almost all vegetarian dishes. the only negative point for me is that the restaurant is not in a prime location like amsterdam, so should travel to amstelveen. if you are looking for quality and taste of food, this restaurant is highly recommended."
very nice restaurant and very delicious food. i love their biryani and currys. malai tikka is really very very tasty. i would really recommend this restaurant.
"a good reason to visit amstelveen is this indian restaurant. the ambiance is very pleasant, the staff welcoming and professional and above all the food is excellent. a good reason to make a trip again for us."
very good food - both veg and non-veg.  you need a booking before you visit this place as it is booked most of the times.   be prepared to spend time as food takes some time but is worth the wait.
the food at the indian kitchen is always fantastic! 
"the restaurant looks really nice and cosy , the staff is helpful and friendl "
"very nice place, great hospitality, excellent food. place to be around amsterdam if you like indian food !"
"had a nice dinner, liked the idea that you can choose how spicy you want your curry. portion size was plenty, service was also very friendly."
all our dishes were good but more variety like salads and vegetable side dishes would be even better. service was excellent and the venue is attractive.
"we had researched an indian restaurant in this area of amsterdam where we were staying,this did not disappoint,contemporary modern,stylish surroundings and very good friendly service,dishes we had were very well spiced,and all delicious,pricing is a little high but overall a great place to visit,a great destination if you are staying in amstellveen."
the food was good. but here is what i loved about the place - superb servic 
great place to have indian food .loved the flavorful and spicy dishes along with warm and personal service. .
"although i live very close by i only recently visited this place for the first time. mainly because on the outside it does not look very appealing. however, inside it looks great! nice interior and the dimmed lights make it a cosy place. the menu is pretty long so difficult to choose. we asked for mild spicy and that was a good choice. the food was great! on the same evening there was a large group having dinner but that did not impact our service, it was quick and nice. the people only speak english and remember to bring some cash as they dont accept to pay the tip by card."
"my first time going to this restaurant although i have tried their food already for 3 years at the diwali festival in amstelveen, where they use to be one of the food providers during the festiviti "
"great atmosphere, delicious food, friendly service and a good variety.  i recommend it to meat lovers and to vegetarians  r oz"
weve been many times in the past three months and love the flavorful and spicy dishes along with warm and personal service. the kitchen will honor your requests for spice and the food always arrives sizzling hot. wonderful naan. we like their indian beer selection as well. 
"lovely food, great ambience and to top it all great service.what more can i say!! thanks for the lovely time."
"we went there for official dinner with colleagues with expectations of authenticity with indian taste. we found this restaurant to be the closest to the indian food and taste. they cooked really nice food using all possible indian masalas that you can think of and spices. off course you can ask to make it more or less spicy according to your taste and they did mix it really well. advisable to book in advance to avoid waiting else you can always walk in. they have nice seating arrangements but fact of it being in amstelveen, it gets very crowded sometimes. recommended indian restaurant."
"in residential part of amstelveen, you find this authentic good indian restaurant with modern setup. lovely interior, nice service and vibrant atmosphere."
we eat a lot of indian food and were very impressed with the quality and authentic flavours in this restaurant. we asked for our food spicy and it came with a nice amount of heat - the kind that makes you sweat but is full of flavour. the servers were surprised that we wanted spicy food and that we could eat it! i think they are used to local dutch customers who are not accustomed to spicy food. highly recommend the balti king prawns (hot) and the homemade kulfi was very good. 
"i am an indian and love indian food. after having tried so many indian restaurants in the us and europe, the indian kitchen is definitely one of the good one that stands o "
"who doesnt love indian food ? its tastey, pleasant to look at and full off spicy aromas. but finding a good indian restaurant can be a gamble. as i walked in the indian kitchen restaurant it gave me a very clean & fresh feeling , although the lightenings were a bit dim ,  its the contemporary style  i was told by a frien "
"having been to holland numerous times over the years to see my daughter, i was delighted when she told me that her and her husband had found a new indian restaurant for me to try on my latest visit last week. every time i visit the amsterdam area, i usually find an indian restaurant to try and this one did not disappoint. the food was excellent and the staff friendly and welcoming. this turned out to be one of the best curries i have had in holland and i thoroughly recommend people to try it. i certainly hope to return there sometime in the future."
"absolutely one of my top favorite indian restaurants in amsterdam and around. we eat there quite often and the food is always soooo delicious and fresh. atmosphere is nice, staff is friendly. highly recommend!"
one the better places to eat great indian food in amsterdam. we have been to many india restaurants in and around amsterdam and this is definitely one on the top. an excellent place to go out with family and friends.
"wow, the indian food at this local hangout is so extremely authentic! we really felt like being back in india. to cater to the dutch untrained tastes they serve the meals mild spicy, spicy and hot. we started with the mild version but for sure will try the spicier one next time."
"great authentic food, cozy place and welcoming personel! we recommend the meat balls and curry dishes. we look forward to be back here.."
"if you want to eat indian, just go here. fresh bread, super tasty meat and really cool place to enjoy food. a little bit pricey (avg 30 euro per person) but for the quality not really too expensive."
i have already eaten here a couple of times. the food is among the best indian food that i have eaten and the quality is consisten 
been here 2 times... we dont there is a very fine authentic restaurant near to our house .. my husband is loving it and myself too.. really good authentic indian food ... cant wait to comeback again
"what a lovely restaurant. excellent food, each dish has a distinct flavour. staff where brilliant and changed some of the menu to accommodate by british curry demands"
very tasty and authentic indian food. restaurant atmosphere invites to stay.  attentive and friendly service. everything you are looking for.
"nice decoration, good food, friendly service. it was not very crowded which was handy with small children."
"after three visits i can safely say that this is an outstanding indian restaurant, at par with the better ones in londo "
as i do not live too far from this restaurant i mainly use the take-out option. as the location is not very typical for a restaurant the flavours are very typical for authentic indian food. the decor of the restaurant is very modern and staff friendly. i have sampled most items of the menu and the food is consistently good. would recommend this place if you live nearby and do not want to go into downtown amsterdam.
"this place serves some of the best authentic indian food in noord-holland. the veggie dishes remind me of the food i grew up eating at home. service is good, and its fairly good value for mone "
"real indian for indians. i know the place for many years, since when it was a small supermarket and take away. food has always been great and consistent. you just need to ensure that you tell the chef/waiter if you want the food real indian spicy or normal. if you say nothing, the spiciness tends to be adapted to local taste"
wonderful experience. modern nice deco with separate bar area. i cannot express enough the quality of food at this place. one of the best indian restaurants i have been to. meat so tenderly cooked. rice fluffy and fragrant. awesome service as wel 
"good indian food, moderen restaurant, caters to clients who like spicy honest food, there are often many indian expats eating here, the service is sometimes slow but that is compensated by the quality of the food"
"great experience, lovely staff and good prices- by far the best indian meal i have ever eaten. the meats were very tender and tasty. i cannot speak higher of this place - i will be returning again soon."
"had a wonderful experience at the indian kitchen, the staff are very good at recommending what would best suit your tastes, they are very friendly and efficient and made me fell extremely welcome, i went for the king prawn starters (which i do in most indian restaurants) but they were perfectly spiced and very ni "
"being an indian, who grew up in amsterdam, i have long searched for a restaurant that could come close to the real indian taste. despite having visited almost every indian place in amsterdam, a few in the hague, rotterdam and in utrecht...there was none that could live up to that expectation. however, after a recent recommendation by my father, i decided to give the indian kitchen a go. the interior is very well done, an open lounge to enjoy drinks followed by cosy restaurant. the serving staff is polite and knowledgeable (compliments as not all are indian!). the service is quick and food amazing! i was amazed to taste the bhuna murgh tikka and badami murgh seekh. imagine the perfectly grilled chicken with a well balanced melange of spices...the quantity of chutneys is a point of improvement though. the main course of murgh kadaiwala and well prepared (thin!) butter naan added to the great culinary experience. i could go on and on, conclusion; definitely worth a visit! been back thrice alrea "
weve now been living in amstelveen for 6vmonths and normally go to amsterdam for indian food. yesterday tried the indian kitchen. this is pretty good indian restaurant. weve have a great butter chicken and a very tasty mutton korma. for starter we had jumbo shrimps and these we not up to the level - the shrimp was dry and had no taste. simply medioc 
stumbled upon it as was staying overnight near the airport and it is close. great service and food is delicious. highly recommend it to try if you want authentic taste of india.
"after 13 years of searching, i have finally eaten a delicious indian meal in holland. the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was very friendly and very attentive. the menu has a wide variety of choice with something for every curry lover. they even asked which spice level we would like! the food was not only presented beautifully but tasted wonderful - the perfect combination of heat and spice depth! i have come to expect in holland that the price of an indian meal is much more expensive than in the uk - this restaurant is no exception but on this occasion it was well worth it. will definitely be recommending it and making a return trip soon."
as this is hubbys favourite food we are always happy to try new indian restaur 
"so excited to have found this place so close to home. weve been going in to amsterdam for our indian fix, not knowing about this place. tonight, a friend mentioned it so we went. the place looks really nice from the outside, even nicer in the inside, the service very good and friendly, and finally, the food is some of the best ive had since moving to nl 18 months ago! my son had the tandoori chicken, my husband the chicken madras, and i the paneer makhni. all delicious. we will be returning again soon...and often!"
ordered butter chicken and garlic naan from here based on the recommendation from a friend. totally worth it. compares to the butter chickens i have had back in india. if you feel the punjabi food craving would definitely go to this place
i was there with a business associate and decided to sit in the nice & cozy lounge. we had few drinks and some tandoori items. chicken malai tikka was great!! the service was prompt and friendly! would certainly recommend for business meetings and events in addition to a quiet night out with the family :)
"we visited the restaurant on 1st jan, 2015 to embark the new year with good food. and must say it was a very pleasant dining experience. enjoyed the food thoroughly. good options for vegetarians. ambience is appealing. nice sta "
"good place to have lunch or dinner with friends or family. nice dishes, also fun menus for kids. can become crowded sometimes, so its wise to make a table reservation in advance."
"we had lunch outside on the terrace and because it was market day and the weather was beautiful, it was hard finding a table. their food is always good and reasonably priced. the staff was very busy but quick, efficient and friendly. we‚Äôll be back."
lovely lunch on the patio can not believe this weather.  the menu is still traditionally dutch and you cant beat the kroketten.  ask for mayo for the frites.
"i like popov in amstelveen centre, it‚Äôs an establishment that has been with us for years and it never fails. even when it is packed, service is quick and food served is tasty. and it is not pricy....  enjoy"
really enjoyed to have food here and friendly staff. i had a great salad and my wife had a hot chicken. both really good.
"great bar/restaurant to enjoy your lunch or your cup of coffee on the terras. situated on the square of the shopping centre in amstelveen, you can enjoy a good lunch"
for more years than i have been lunching here. first it was downstairs from my apartment. then it was just over the road from my office now i have to drive but it is still worth the trip. if the weather is nice you can people watch on the terrace. if not you can be cozy inside.
"just like the title says, the food at popov was really great and at a good price. the 3 of us had super burgers for lunch. you will be surprised of how big the plate is: large portion of fries, double burgers with veggies and an e "
"i probably eat at popov a couple of times a month. it is my go to lunch restaurant in the heart of amstelveen. the food is great, and the service unusually snappy by dutch standards. can be in and out in 20mins if you want to be."
i eat here often for lunch and im always satisfied with the food and service.  the meals are freshly made and value for money. the fresh juices are also very good!
"i have been twice to this restaurant in the last month, and both times the food was really excellent. on the second time the service was a bit slow and considering the cafe was virtually empty as it was almost 3pm, it was disappointing but did not change my very high opinion of the restaurant generally. i can recommend their goats cheese salad and both their salmon, and their pastrami club sandwiches. really top notch!"
been visiting popov every time i go to amsterdam. it is located at the amstelveen mall and very easy to locate while walking around the 
"this restaurant in the stadshart of amstelveen is always buzzing with business, probably also due to the generous portions of food you ge there for your money. the huge foodcounter makes it a little mac-donaldlike but obviously when there are always so many meals to serve it cannot be done otherwise, so the ambiance is a little bit lacking, but truth to tell we go there for food dont we?"
"food is just good - but solid, good value, reliable and ple "
"this is quite a large place, and very busy, but the staff is very efficient. go to the upstairs, it is a bit more palatable there.  the food is good: we had a focaccia goat cheese and a bun with warm meat and satay sauce."
"in between shopping we enjoyed a nice lunch at popov, they have a nice terrace where you also have some seats where the rain wont bother you üòÑ we did see something on the menu but wanted it slightly different. ham instead of salami and that was no problem at all. so they are very flexible which is a plus. the staff is very friendly and the food is very tasty. they have enough to choose from at reasonable prices. so when you are shopping here, try it and im sure youll love it too üòç"
i live a walking distance from the stadsplein amstelveen and popov restaurant is my favourite for lunch in this shopping ar 
the restaurant features authentic japanese food and the atmosphere reminds me of japan. i always enjoy coming here. there are japanese and english menus with pictures.
"the atmosphere of the restaurant is fabulous! the owner is japanese and i miss japanese cuisine so much, i can find authentic taste in nagomi restaurant! what a surprise with good service!"
the place is very cozy and modest. the food was authentic but too bad they didnt have soba noodles on the day we came. will definitely come back.
"at last a very good japanese family food restaurant discovered inside a shopping center in amstelveen. in this small restaurant they serve delicious food. we had seaweed salade, edamame, shashimi, dried tofu, tonkatsu, tempura, chicken, crocket, gyoza and miso soup. you could taste that all the food we had was made from fresh ingredients. although there were only 2 staffs the service was fast and good. we loved the food here."
we were in amstelveen to attend the cherry blossom festival and decided to have japanese dinner to complete the day with japanese culture. we were recommended to this restaurant by a japanese expat in amstelveen. so we knew it will be go 
"this place was recommended to us by a family-member, so we went with a group of seven people. the restaurant is very cosy, since its not that big and our waitress was very friendly. the menu has quite some dishes to offer, varying from noodles to small bites to meat or fish dishes. we started with some small dishes to share, the chef suggested us to try the takoyaki (little octopus-filled balls), which tasted really really good! furthermore we had some assorted tempura and lotus tempura, some deep fried chicken and some gyoza. for the main course we ordered udon and soba noodle soups. each dish proved to be very delicate and tast "
"we ordered katsudon, ramen, takoyaki and gyozo. it was really delicious. im sure we will come more often to this little place. the service was really friendly. they take the time to take your order and the food came out fast."
"went for a coffee little after 11am at sunday and the place was already almost full. the service was really nice and friendly, and the whole atmosphere was so relaxed. tasted two different cakes and both were so good, that couldn‚Äôt say which was better."
"this is the second visit we have made to this charming restaurant, with street seating too, in the last two month "
thank goodness for a quick shower or we may not have tried this caf√©! as a coeliac i have to be careful on my choice of menu but they could not have been more helpful. enjoyed the salad and the wine followed by a nice cuppa.
"after visiting an art museum in the old town of amstelveen, i went with a friend to this la gare cafe for the first ti "
as the title mentions it is the place to go to if one is looking for a lunch option where everything is organic including the coffee. i personally recommend this also to people looking for a vegan option. nice and casual. i would personally recommend the grilled vegetables and hummus.
"conveniently located within a large shopping area. seating is available both inside and out. nice selections of food for breakfast and lunch. the quiche of the day, goat cheese with eggplant and tomato was delicious. prices were reasonable and servers were friendly. would recommend for a snack or early day meal."
"nice people, simple but good dishes and drinks. nothing special and very convenient place. located in a wonderful shopping area."
"great location, reasonable prices with great quality food.  staff always very friendly.  lots of choices for all food lovers including vegetarian/vegan."
friendly staff. consistently good food. my favourite is mint team and scrambled eggs with pancetta. breads and jams are always great.
"this restaurant in the shopping mall of amstelveen provides healthy, natural but still tasty dishes. two big terraces, so always sun (when it shines) but also lots of room inside. the only negative thing is the terrible noise the climate installation produces... easy guys, fix this!"
"now to have breakfast or lunch you will never go wrong here. its decent food, slightly overpriced, fresh and high quality. good service, free internet, what more do you need. took a manhattan, salmon, fresh bread, egg breakfast, wasnt much and cheap, but tasted great."
"i love the almond croissants! having eaten many croissants and french breads finally here they actually taste like they should. pricey its not a regular place to visit but great for a treat. relaxed, friendly service makes every day feel like sunday morning."
"good food, the service is sometimes not so quick. as a vegetarian i do enjoy the variety of veggie dishes."
"we are regular visitors. friendly welcoming staff. good selection of snacks, sandwiches and food also to take away.  also serves wine."
"great menu, with range of heathy options. great gluten free bread!!! dont see this on the menu much in the netherlands and its great they have this option!"
good variety of breakfast and lunch options.  well presented and tasty food. staff very friendly.  much nicer than a starbucks.  would definitely recommend.
the food is oke and most of it is organic. the salmon with avocado where tasty. the service can be better and is a little impersonal.
this restaurant is perfect for a light healthy meal in amstelveen stadshart. its located in what is probably one of the biggest and most complete shopping malls in the netherlan 
i but especially my daughter goes here often for lunch. it is good food and the atmosphere is great and certainly a lot better than the average teenage hang-out. send your teens here.
big orange juice and a very nice omelette will be costing me about 14 euros. ..do not cheap but do far very nice.
this chain has the best food for lunch and breakfast everything taste better because its honest fo 
the major clentele of the restaurant are the visitors of the nearby fitness centres. the card shows that and offer healthy meals. we had tom kha soup (very good) and vitello tonato (cold dish presented in a carpacio format). super tender veal meat.
"found this place by accident when visiting for a volleyball game. place is nice and open; you arent squished up against other tables so it was very comfortable. service was friendly and helpful. we had kipsate and pasta and both were delicious. cappuccino was good as well. not much else to say. good food, friendly service and nice atmosphere. what else could you ask for?"
this is very nice choice if in the area. there is comfortable indoor seating and also outside seating in summer. food is consistently well prepared (i have eaten here many times) and service is good. i recommend a visit if in the area a definitely after a work-out as the cafe is inside the sports complex.
"my favorite place in amstelveen. perfect for meetings, lunch and dinners. parking is perfect and their corn kip salad is my favorite"
"i went some times during my stay in amstelveen, and all can i say is that the food is really nice. the service was also good. the portions are very good so you will never get hungry after eating he "
"we have been here a few times and it still surprise us. we came a couple of weeks ago to try the ah dinnerbon. the menu was very goid, they adapted my request for gluten free and we really enjoyed it. service was very good as well!"
popular restaurant for business lunches or diners. even have a bigger room which you can hire for a party or presentation.
it was quite a surprise to see so much flavours induced into good old salad. i had ordered prawn and chicken salad and the chef managed to find near perfect balance in making it a wholesome experience rather than a boring drag we seem to identify salads with more and a more. simply amazing.. would try the restaurant more often in future. 
"if you want to have delicious food and good service , you should try this at least once , you wont be disappointed"
"this is a good restaurant/cafe located inside the building of the health city gym. over the past few years we have eaten here from time-to-time as we live in the area and my wife is a member of the gym. the food is usually very good, particularly the range of salads they make. in summer there is a nice area outside to eat and have a drink as well. the service is speedy and efficient and generally welcoming. plus the seating is very comfortable. a good choice for a mid-week dinner or drink with a friend or partner. "
the gran cafe all sports is a good option for a light lun 
"compared to many cafes in the vicinity, this cafe has an amazingly wide spread of items on its menu....and given its a cafe addressing the audience from the gym thats even more surprising. not only is the spread big but the quality of food is great too. my favourite here used to be the ravioli in the truffle sauce which they have sadly taken off the menu and only available as a special some days...dont miss it if you catch it. they also do pretty good nasi goreng. another delight - they are open till midnight for drinks and till 10 for dinner which is quite a delight in this sleepy town :)"
ate here several times on a recent business trip to amstelveen. lovely local restaurant - in that it isnt really a tourist restaurant. my companion commented that the steak was the best hed had anywhere in the world.
this restaurant is hidden away in a residential area and not somewhere you would generally pa 
"wonderful food, everything fresh and owner and chef bart did everything to make it to our specific tastes. only tiny set-back is the noise created by the high ceilings in the joodse bruid chamber.."
the salmon we ate at the restaurant rembrandt was merely the very best i have ever tast 
"nice evening: warm welcome, well-furnished local, simple dishes well presented, good taste and good service"
what a difference a good chef makes...went a few times to rembrandt and the chef bart never disappointed me. the menu is not extensive but all dishes are very good as well as the service. a good choice of high quality wines matches the excellent cuisine. a gem in amstelveen!
great improvements were made since bart took over the place. sympathetic and great food. big groups or alone: everything is possible. love to be there.
"the menu is not extensive, but after two meals there, i can say that it is all very good.  the staff is great, and the attention to details are great.  the wine by the glass is reasonable, and of high quality."
"hidden amongst residential buildings, very tasty haute cuisine. has the tuna tartare and the dorado. both we truly perfect. decent service. will return."
"this restaurant is a bit hidden between the high buildings of the groenlaan and surroundings. it is a nice place with knowledgeable staff who are friendly and helpful when you come with a person in a wheelchair. surprisingly good food, a pity people do not seem to find this place easily. lovely inexpensive lunch menu. good place to crash and relax."
"the staff were nice, the food was good, and it had a good atmosphere.   they didnt have credit card though, so bring enough cash if you dont have a local debit card."
"we‚Äôve been several times. very tasty and reasonably priced. no seating inside, only takeaway, always busy so call early. you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"we have been here many times for take away meals, which are always very tasty. the staff provides good service. and we even have ordered here for big parties and the well prepared dishes were liked very much by all our guests."
delicious food but one piece of advice if i may be so bold. as a vegetarian i see that the meat dishes are stored at the front of the cooler. when meat is spooned from the front sometimes a piece of meat or a drop of juice may spill off the spoon into the veggie dishes. obviously spoiling the veggie food for vegetarians. may i suggest they put the veggie dishes at the front of the cabinet? 
"the food is very authentic. it is excellent and delicious. it is always fresh. towards the end of the end you may find many dishes sold out. the service is very knowledgable, friendly and to the poi "
this is more a takeaway than a restaurant but its delicious! the price is decided by weight and is not very expensive.
"this place is mostly for take out, even thought they have a couple of tablets, but totally recommended! the food is delicious. we plan to go often to buy food here."
toko madjoe has something for everyone to choose from. quality has already been mentioned by fellow reviewers acting as word of mouth for us to go ahead and try it up. however its more of take away offer with little seating to dine in.
"it is a small restaurant and take-away. the food is excellent, good value for money and very good service. there are a couple of tables, so you could also eat there."
this is a wonderful little place where you chose your rice table.  the owners serve your food in plastic containers and weigh the contents. it is a great way to experience indonesian food. food was fun.  choosing the food was entertaining. consuming it even better!
"when you want to taste indonesian food as the indonesian food supposed to be, you have to come to this place. its not a restaurant but more take away restaurant though there are 2 tables where you can sit and enjoy your meal. the sate is very good so the other things too."
toko madjoe is take out only. very popular with the locals it gets very busy around 4-6pm. with a very large selection of indonesian dishes to choose from.  the taste and quality is very authentic!!!
"although this shop has 1-2 small tables to enjoy some of their food on the spot, this essentially is a take-out shop for ready-made indonesian food and ingredients for home-cooki "
"stayed at the amsterdam forest and got to compare the 3 restaurants in the area and this seemed to be the most reasonably priced of the 3 (one was serving food worth 75 euro. no wonder it was empty!). well, theres a pizza restaurant nearby but pizza for lunch or dinner sounds of "
it was a wonderful experience. delicious food and great service. i would highly recommend this restaurant.
"absolutely amazing food. i had the tbone, cooked to my specification and was perfect. we had a wee tray of sauces that were a beautiful accompaniment to our meal. the customer experience was warm, welcoming and super attentive. reasonably priced and worth every penny. anyone staying in the amstelveen area should make a visit. thank you for the wonderful meal."
super food and ambient! great taste of all natural! handmade meal is handmade meal. no plasticsss we eat everyday. and the fire smells so fantastic! bravooooo bravooo bravooo!
visited here a number of times during a week long stay in amstelveen. the staff were very friendly and service was excellent. the weather was great so we could sit outside. drinks or a meal the service always came with a smile and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. the were a couple of veggie/vegan options and the home made hummus was amazin 
"been coming here since 2005 love the place , kebabs are divine , all the food is so tasty and reasonably priced ."
"place is clean. just in front of my hotel. great service, tasty food, accurate prices.  what else for a quick dinner!!! very recommendable!!! tbone stock was delicious üòã"
"this is an informal, no-frills place. if you‚Äôre after simple, fresh but high quality food after a busy day, and you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood, the food here is excellent. i was staying in the delightful forest hotel just across the road, and came here for a falafel after a long day. the falafel was perfect with wonderful fresh pittas and lovely tahini and humus dips. i ordered orange juice which came freshly squeezed. i liked it so much i went back the next night and had shoarma which was shredded lamb. a huge portion, again with lots of wonderful fresh dips to choose from. there is a menu in english and the service was friendly and efficient. the restaurant area is quite basic - i wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a big night out - but for a good quality quick informal meal it‚Äôs perfect. they also have some outside seating for a warm evening. "
"i was staying across the road at the amsterdam forest hotel and didnt want to go too far to eat. this place was.l just what i needed. the waiter was really helpful with my questions on the old and they tailored the spice up to my liking. food was very tasty and enjoyable. it was simple, but not fussy and just what id hoped for. i wouldnt travel far especially to eat here, but if youre close by its a good option."
we ate here once while staying in amstelveen. i had the chicken livers which were fantastic. the food portions are generous and come with lots of lovely little sauces to dip everything  
this little bar & grill wont disappoint but be careful not to overdo the garlic mayo...the wife wont come near me now lol
"the rooz was walking distance from our aribnb and a good choice. first of all, its an unassuming fa√ßade, right off the bike path on a busy street. however, what it lacks in wow factor is made up by the pleasant, very helpful staff and interesting me "
"dont be deceived by the basic interior and limited wine menu. generous portions, excellent friendly service and superb food makes this place a winner! the avocado salad is to die for! the chicken is tender and marinated to perfection. not sure what the theme is here but there are israeli street plaques on the walls and the menu is between lebanese and greek. the restaurant is only across the road from the delightful amsterdam forest hotel so if you are a weary traveler its an ideal spot. the only downside is that since this is outside the main city the menu is not available in english so assistance was needed by the staff to decipher the menu! "
"the rooz grill bar offers oriental / israeli style food (falafel, pita etc.). the food we ordered didnt take long to be served and was good quality. it was all fresh, and especially the dips and sauces really seemed freshly and home made. only the waitress could have been a little more attentive. we wanted to have another drink, but she always went about, not paying much attention to us, once we had our food."
"such a nice cafe with lovely ambience and good quality coffee. loved the cafe their coffee, carrot cake and the cheese sandwich is just perfect. wouldn‚Äôt mind visiting again."
"the bookstore we had visited already on multiple occasions. this cafe inside it looks appealing, but somehow we always walked past it. this time i took some time to get a tea and apple juice with my daughter. friendly staff, nice seating and it was good to see some scrablle going on at the large table. a nice place. if you want to nuy or browse some books, be sure to have a tea here as well."
"an excellent place to enjoy great coffee, wonderfully crunchy toasties, and other delectables. very nice serving staff! and surrounded by books books books!"
"if in need of a cup of tea, especially if alone, this is the right place! it is relaxing to sip while watching the main square or reading a book that can be borrowed in the cafe."
"very much in demand, the venstra caf√© continue to be many peoples option to go with friends or family after shopping in the area, or shopping in the bookshop to which the caf√© is attach "
this is a nice place to go for a coffee or tea with friends and take opportunity to buy books or gif 
so vegan friendly that they can make almost any dish veg 
"the restaurant is just a 5 minute walk from the tram station. amazing thai food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere and great value for money!"
"i eat here 3 times a week and every time its delicious, they have something for everyone and very friendly staffüî•"
"lovely place, wonderful ambiance, friendly and welcoming staff. the dishes are nicely decorated and  delightful. ."
"oded very good host and thai food up to mark! every now and then, we have dinner and it really reminds us of the days we had to travel via bangkok for duty! tip : if you like it, take the hot beef thai version,! ask oded how many hot peppers you want, in your dish!! i take 3 for kicks, tea, water!sart with one dutch genever.!!! then the irish coffee in the end and your back in bangkok almost! pffff, next time i will ask him to put up thr central heating to 30 degrees....!!!! "
nice restaurant close to our hotel. the three spice fish was super tasty and the service was great. noodles were not the best but the rice was great
"my mother and i came here as our first dinner in amsterdam and we were beyond amazed! food was amazing and very large portions, well priced and the staff were so kind."
"we had a nice family dinner of four and they offer both self-order food and set-menu food. we did not get the set-menu food since ordering separately was cheaper considering the enormous quantity of food they offer per dish. overall, we thought it was a good restaurant with a good (food-quantity) value for money. however, we had to wait 20 min to get a table so would definitely recommend to reserve a table before going there."
we had friends visit at amstelveen and we went to thai from sky.  the pad thai was the best i ever ate.  massaman dish grabbed by all parties and we immediately ordered another one - don‚Äôt miss it!
"weve dinner at this restaurant late night, and were very impressed about how gently were the people. were actually alone in the restaurant - no other costumers - but theyve served us so fast and spent time talking about thai culture. the food was generously served and tasteful - this was my 1st experience in thai food and ive approved. "
"whenever we are out of options for unplanned dinner, this is the place. always available, good food very consistent and price is also decent. if you are looking for an easy asian option in amstelveen, this is the place!"
"again ,we never have been disappointed,even after our 5 th visit???while on detachment abroad,we had to fly via bangk "
visited thai from sky in may 2017 while on holiday. the restaurant is located inside of a somewhat dated shopping mall. the food was very nice and tasty. the waiter was nice and attentive. quick service. would go back if i ever visit amstelven again.
get the taste of thai food at this cozy restaurant. staff/owner very friendly and always smiling. food is good and service is quite quick!
this place serves authentic tasty thai food and for a thai girl like me they made it extra spicy! they have just renovated and the restaurant looks amazing!
"if you are looking for good thai food, this is it. thai from sky is situated inside the shopping area near the zonnestein metro station next to dirk van den broek super market. the decor and the seating is decent, not the swankiest place but the staff is quite friendly. this restaurant also offers take away and delivery however delivery is only after 5 pm and take away is after 2 pm, thats the time when it open "
it is many years that i am addicted to this place. i come here regularly for take-away meals or to sit in the restaurant. they recently renovated the place and maintained their nice cuisine.
"i dont know what everyone else is talking about, but this place is great. came here and experienced amazing service and excellent food. the atmosphere is nice, and while the prices are a bit higher than other thai joints, its worth it, because portions are a good size, and the food is of a different quality than the really cheap thai places. for example, the chicken here wasnt squishy, leathery chicken. it was great meat that was tender and delicious. my tom kha kai soup and stir fried spicy chicken with basil was yummy (and not too spicy... just right "
"its a real thai cooking in amstelveen, even comparable with the kind of thai restaurant in amsterdam city center (e.g bird) definitely try the papaya salad to accompany your thai red chicken curry, real good."
"we have been eating here some times before ans always the food is very good, both quality and quantity, with a very good plate of starters. people working there are nice, helpful and very knowledgeable. cant wait to go back!"
"after more than a week in amsterdam, my friend missed already thai food so we brought her to this restaurant. she ordered some vegetarian menu for us in her languange (thais) and we really had a good diner. the price is a little bit higher than other thai restaurants but you will have a delicious thai food."
"while visiting my family, we went to their favourite thai  place, and it was superb!  i got the perfect thai cuisine experience, and the waitress was so kind... ask for the som tum, you wont regret it"
we were there with the family for a dinner. the service and advise on the menu is something really appreciated by someone like me who is not a thai food expert  
warm ambience in this simple local thai.  friendly and efficient service.  the fish cakes were up to standard.  we asked for pad thai without onions - fine!
went with a group of 9 and had a very nice time. food was great and service was excellent. ordered several appetizers and main dishes and shared around the table family style. cost was very reasonable; about 16 euro per person and that included some beers and a bottle of wine. we will definitely be going back.
"we tried the food from this restaurant last month while we were in the neighborhood. the restaurant is located near major supermakets surrounded by other good eateries but is the only place serving thai food. the food was very well prepared and tasty. we had a soup and two curries on with green gravy and the other with red gravy. the dishes were very well spiced and seasoned and the quantity was very good as well. we also ordered food for takeaway on another occasion and were not dissapointed with the taste at all. the prices are on the higher side for a restaurant of its size and grade, but looking at the quantity and quality, the price is just about justified. hopefully the quality and price would remain stable in future as well."
the location is so so the food is good the prices are slightly high for a regular category restaurant.
well in time we made reservations for a birthday party. the manager talked us through what he could offer. we were offered a room and terrace for the period from 15.00 hrs. to 20.00 hrs. on a sund 
"we were there for dinner. it was nice and cozy restaurant. we had duo van wild and spare ribs. both dishes were amazing, well decorated and delicious. dessert was great all. staffs were lovely."
"beachclub nu offers a restaurant but also a very nice terrace where you can enjoy the view of the beach, the lake and in the distance you get a glance of the nice former fisher town elbu "
"as it was a bit windy and chill, we were sitting inside. however, we can still enjoy our snack time here, with beach scene and city far ahead."
had their homemade bitterballen and the fruitcake. nice restaurant ambient with terrace. they got as well their own organic vegetables farm. plenty of parking space.
we ate here many times. the restaurant is nice and intimate.  the food and service is perfect.  i recommend it to everyone.
"again a great evening, company, great wine, ask for the wine list! the food is excellent for this price, not even mentioning the atmosphere and the service, thanks  a lot!"
the restaurant is located near the center of bedum. the restaurant is not to big and has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. we enjoyed a very good three course dinner on a sunday evening. the food is above average but the prices are very reasonable. if you want to visit this restaurant it might be wise to make a reservation.
first visit here was very well received. went with a family of 4. waiters very good. atmosphere nice if a little over the top on the french inauthenticity. food was excellent.
"this is the restaurant of my hometown, im a regular customer. the menu is above average but the price level is very reasonable. the restaurant gives a cozy, slight luxury impression. the staff is very friendly and hit the perfect stance. also families with children will have a nice evening over here. try the desser "
i had dinner here with a friend. the menu consisted mostly out of numerous pastas and pizzas. but the good stuff is found in the meat dishes. we started our dinner with a big plate of antipasti for two. but in reality this was easily enough to feed three peopl 
we were recommended this restaurant by the owner of the b&b we stayed at nearby and it was exactly as he described it. a vast range of pizzas (i have never seen a menu with so many different kinds of pizza!). clearly very fresh ingredients and the staff were all very friendly. definitely recommended.
"we had something to celebrate and went with 4 people for a dinner. when we made the reservation we were advised to change our arrival time a little since also a large group came at the same time. always nice if they think ahead! when we arrived we were welcomed very friendly and we could choose where to sit. they didnt mind our baby and were very friendly to the baby. good and timely service, very good real italian food, friendly people and a real good price. like in italy they dont mind if you order a pizza which is not on the menu. even gluten-free for my wife was no problem."
best pizzas ive had in my life so far. has a section where kids can play until the food is served.
"always a friendly welcome. cozy little bistro with a surprisingly tasty menu from local suppliers made in the small kitchen/battleground just inside the door. well worth a visit for a coffee, tea salad or lunch."
"the sandwiches and salades that are served here are of a very high quality at a reasonable price. they look good and taste even better. the only downside is that you cant have a normal conversation inside, since there are too many tables in a small room. if the weather is good enough, make a reservation for a table outside. no view, but a better atmosphere! note that this is not a restaurant for a fast lunch!! time beween ordering and serving can easily run up to more then half an hour."
it sounds italian - but nothing like that! it is tastefull spiced antillian caribic food & sandwiches in a housechamber setting. at the entrace you can take a look in the kitchen and have a talk with the cook.
"on vacation in nijmegen, my friends invited me to discover a small lunch place in beneden-leeuwen. it‚Äôs on the road from nijmegen to ‚Äòs hertogenbosch, about a 20 minute drive from nijmegen. this small village in gelderland is a typical dutch village with all the charm of it. on that road stands a small plaza, composed of a coffee roaster, a decoration shop and an excellent lunch room, called marcus antonius, named after the owner who is also the cook and sometimes the waiter: marc. only a few tables stands in a nice and well decorated room. those tables are not design tables, but strong wooden structures. natural wood, just as the food: natural and quality food. we went for high tea. it is not the high tea we know, but composed of different dishes and one sweet dish. i got the caribbean tomato soup: creamy with plenty of herbs. very tasty. it was so good, that i ordered a second portion. we also got a degustation of goat with grilled egg-plant topped with a small piece of goat cheese, and finally grilled salmon with vegetables. it was really good. the lunch menu is also composed of the more traditional dishes such as salads (carpaccio salad, grilled thai chicken salad, guapo salad), toasted bread (cream cheese, honey and lemon thyme or more traditional : ham and cheese) and lots of sandwiches with lots of cold cuts, cheeses, poultry, salads and much mor "
"we watch a hard working draw bridge that leads tourists sailing their boats towards the tjeukermeer while we are having our beers, our perfectly chilled glass of wine and enjoying the traditional dutch bitter balls. wonderful place with good service."
visited while staying with friends in the are 
went here with the family.  always a good place to go for dinner. they now have a tablet system like a lot of sushi places have to place some orders. very nice buffet and highly recommend you try it out!
you pay the one price which includes non-alcoholic drinks and access to the buffet for 2.5 h 
"a great combination of asian and international food, you can choose your ingredients and create your own wok. i particularly liked the indonesian specialities. non alcoholic beverages included."
"we went here for the 2nd easter day.  wasnt too busy, but lots of food to choose from!  everything was great!!!! if you do go, try to get a table in the back room.  i call it the atrium.  its all glass."
"i have been here many times already and can highly recommend this place for dinner. it has a really large variety of dishes to choose from. ranging from sushi to pizza to steaks to grilled fish to chinese to wok dishes, all is there and in perfect quality. the drinks are also included into the all-you-can-eat price and are not even limited to the standard basic drinks, but also fresh orange juice (delicious!), coffee, tea and less common drinks. for alcohol containing drinks you will have to pay one euro extra per gla "
"went here on the way home from de orchidee√´n hoeve. the place is very large and can hold a lot of people. food area is in the center with seating on two sides. lighting was very nice, not too bright and not too dark. the food was amazing. it was a buffet, so they had several options for the picky eater. steaks, seafood, wok, sushi, pizza, pasta, all sorts of veggies & potatoes. with the entrance fee (for up to 2 1/2 hours), you get all you can eat including drinks minus anything alcoholic. desserts were very nice as well. ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, banana & lemon sherbet) soft ice cream, home made creme brule & waffles, lots of other deserts also. staff was very nice and polite. there were lots of employees walking around to pick up empty plates & glasses when you were done with them so you can come back with a fresh pla "
i am a truck driver and as truckstops go this is very good food was very good for the money i had the ribs and a meatball over a 2day stop ov 
"we ate three times in the restaurant whilst staying at the hotel during the weekend. a private buffet party provided everyone with a good combination of freshly cooked hot food with a variety of cold dishes. every last crumb of food was devoured - it was that delicious. breakfast was typical euro fare but very tasty and plates frequently replenished with cold meats, cheeses & breads. a simple lunch before departure was a little slow in arriving but no wonder with so many show visitors ordering such large, hearty meals. well worth calling in here if passing by on the motorway. if you are a long distance lorry driver these people will really look after you. highly recommended for very tasty food at extremely reasonable prices."
"i have been here several times, all the visits are great! lots of food, not too expensive and great servi "
awesome place to enjoy a nice cold beer and snacks with a bunch of good friends. perfect place to relax and have a nice chat.
"just had superb evening sampling beers provided by the knowledgeable folks at pelles with my team mates from the netherlands, germany and  "
"we are a vegetarian and a meat eater and we both had a delicious dinner. the food was well seasoned and the wine was delicious. the waitress was super nice. you can sit outside and they have a lovely courtyard, covered when it rains you are semi outside. inside the restaurant it is a kind of brown cafe. very nice."
after our day at the beach we walked back to this little plaza with a few restaurants and chose duinlust cus of its homely and cosy appearance in which the restaurant differs itself from the others.. it was quite hot and busy but the staff remained calm and friendly. the food was really amazing and fast. weve had a really good experience and we will be back soon!!
"eetcafe is the best place in dishoek for relax and food. in the center of dishoek just in font of the dune to go to the beach. very good food very friendly service , also nice rooms for rent. fantastic breakfast. my favourite place in this erea."
"friends of ours have visited this place before. they told us it was good and we put it to the test. indeed, service, friendliness and excellent food. that about sums it up. if this place hadnt been closed during the week, we would have stayed there. im not easy to please, but they did it here. well be back!"
"expected more for this price. you can order only 2 dishes per round and they are really small.  wive is very expensive for such place. menu is very big, but this doesn‚Äôt cost this money."
"what a great night. we were seated inside but asked to sit outside and this was not a problem. its a great location, very nice square. didnt like all the dishes, but some were really good (peppersteak!!). there something for everyone. and a big thanks to iris for the great service!!"
"are you looking for a restaurant to eat with you family? this a great place for families with excellent service! everyone can order his or hers favorite starters, main and deserts from the menu while catching-up in a great atmosphere. the food is excellent and offers also many gluten-free and vegetarian options.

i like the restaurant. it has several different styles of decoration 
"this restaurant is one of my favorite places. a mexican restaurant in the center of doetinchem with a large grill selection. personally i am fond of their creekstone farm meat, very tender and juicy till the end. i could recommend fajitas to the mexican lovers as this is great value for money. on weekends they open till 2am, where they change the place to a dance setting. good music and great cocktails. the most important element that this restaurant posses is atmosphere. it gives you a vibe when you walk in and see a huge bar engraved in wood. amazing!"

"we had a very good meal , as a starter shrimps in garlic in a pan , and as a main course spare-ribs with potatoes and colesl "
"what a great place! it is really big and when we visited on a tuesday it was far from full but they manage to maintain a lively, happy atmosphere. this is partly due to the quirky decor, partly the background music (not too intrusive and very varied) and partly by a log fire nearby.the lighting is on the dark side (but that may be my age!). the food was delicious and plentiful - the sizzling platters for the fajitas are flamed at the table - a nice bit of drama. service was good and they gave us english menus as well as speaking english. the men enjoyed the range of beers. will definitely recommend."
tapas style mexican food. nice margheritas but with low alcohol. i dranbk like 8 and nothing much happend :)
"i was visiting some friends in the east of the netherlands, they took me to this place. everything was ok nothing special but also nothing to complai "

a wonderful atmosphere and very good food is what this restaurant offers. the prices are more than reasonable and broad choices. even western style food can be ordered or eaten from their buffet. usually they have some specials and package menus. lets all get amazed by the chinese cooks preparing your meal and dine in a stunning looking restaurant. highly recommended!!

"this place has a really beautiful decor , high sealings , and a relaxed decoratio "
the high ceiling and wood paneling are classier than you would expect if you see the outside of the building. staff is attentive and friendly. the food is hit and miss. desserts are a bit standard and have a bit a from a box character. fish and burgers were good. soup was a bit salty but tasty.

typical dutch food is served. a good range of lunch dishes and a more extensive dinner menu with interesting seasonal proposals. good value for money.
"stopped for lunch on our way to a football match. great choice, everybody happy with their choices and would come back again next time in doetinchem"
we had a delightful time with friends at this italian styled restaurant. i ordered the lasagna with salmon and it was excellent. all the pizzas that passed me by to other tables and my friend looked very good but my stomach was just too small to eat more. i also had the sou 
italian restaurant stretto (eten & drinken) is situated close to the market square in the centre of doetinchem. when we visited them we were lucky with the weather and could sit at a table on the terrace. where you can observe all the passers-by and have a great meal at the same time 
"great pizzas and atmosphere, polite crew and helpfull,in the heart of the city and also nice terrace"
classic lunchroom in the city center of doetinchem that serves a great hamburger; homemade burger on a fresh bun served with crispy bacon and delicious bbq sauce. on the photo the gluten-free version:)

wonderful service and lovely staff. the food was gorgeous. the building is old and characterful. we very much recommend going to restaurant borghuis!
"we had our christmas dinner at entree1863 with 22 business partners. the restaurant is situated in a very stylish and cosy villa. the food was absolutely delicious and the staff is very professional and friendly. nice short but passionate desciptions of every course. the 5 courses were very tastfull, with great wines to accompany the food, in a very relaxed, not too formal setting. we will return here soon, we can recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes great food and true hospitality!"
very nice and friendly staff. the menu has a fair quantity of choices and a something for everyone. i especially enjoyed the curry and ginger soup and the apple bites on the pork belly. the banana with chocolate was not the best dessert ever..
i was invited to join celebration of my friend‚Äôs 25th anniversary and i must say i had wonderful evening.  the chef yarun makes food by heart. the most experienced lady i don‚Äôt remember the name how‚Äôs she has great knowledge of suggesting beverages.
a nice place in this city. with a cuisine which is unlikely for this area. nice person 
"the food was wonderful, friendly service and great atmosphere! personnel was very helpful with wheelchair. all dishes were great."
"i have been there once. food in this restaurant is very good, staff are very friendly. there isint much tables inside. the menu is in greek which when you pick your dishesh you dont reqlly know what you will get but you can ask staff members for help and they will explain it to you."
nice restaurant with friendly staff. nice place to have diner with friends. we ordered some speciality dishes from cook with meat and fish. it was tasteful and not too salty. nice salad. nice oval shaped tables. would recommend this restaurant to everyone!

beautiful location  and great outdoor terrace. most amazing food and drinks! tasty and delicious! service was great . staff incredibly friendly and efficient. will certainly return. thanks again!!
the host is a wonderful hospital man. he creates an atmosphere of real good food in a modern nice environment. the glass terrace is a great place to eat and enjoy. you always get enough and never leave with a half full belly.
this is a small family run restaurant that serve traditional greek food as they have ties to greece. they have very friendly staff and serve nips of liqueur as soon as you sit down. the shared platters were delicious and filled us easily without any space for dessert. the lamb is also delicious since it comes from new zealand! cant recommend enough for a small village!
i really love it. i have been there couple of times and every time lived the food and service. my favourite now. i will surely go more often.  they have good vegetarian choices as well.
"delicious food, great hospitality and fair prices. we had a lovely evening. the owners took good care of their guests. recommended."
"we came to visit the museum which is located in haastrecht, and while passing by de ijsselborgh have decided to have dinner in this restaura "
this is a great place for a meal if you are in haastrecht. it has indoor and outdoor patio seating. they serve their meals in courses and have a nice variety of options on their menu. they also provide their menu in english as well. our server was great and she spoke english very well. haastrecht is already a pretty neat dutch village and the proeflokaal bregje only adds to that charm. enjoy!
"our host recommended this restaurant for a family dinner, and we were not disappointed. we liked everything about it - the food, the service, the atmosphere and the moderate prices. we highly recommend it ourselves!"
good place for a nice evening out without an empty pocket afterwards. we have been here a number of times and the quality was always the same.
"we visited a family member in haastrecht and four of us came here on a monday night. the set meal is cheaper on monday to wednesday so is even better value for 3 courses. i had shrimp salad to start, the beef for main and cheese board or desert, all excellent. i tasted the chicken main dish, again very good. all four of us enjoyed our choices and loved the atmosphere, the service was friendly and efficient and the wine reasonably priced. definitely worth a visit."
"good food compared to their price. i had a goat cheese salad, a caprese tart and as dessert the chocolate cake with ice cream. loved all of this! the only thing that was a bit disappointing was the chocolate cake. its supposed to be a chocolate fondant, but the middle wasnt really melted. dont get me wrong it was still a great dessert and definitely worth the tr "
"in a small village, it was a very surprising lunch. for 12,5 euros ( starter, main course and dessert) the best quality and a very nice and smily service. perfect dinner."
"the hotel isnt the most modern one but the atmosphere is good and the rooms are nice, a bit countru side style. the rooms are not directly in the building with the reception and an elevator isnt available. the restaurant offers a wide choise of dishes and the breakfast was good. in room wifi is free of charge, fast enough and stable. the room was very clean as well as the bath room. price versus quality this hotel is a very good choise."
the service person is very attentive. mustard soup is good. nice light flavor. tomato soup was nice. ribs are good but not delicious.
we stopped here for lunch on thursda 
very cosy place with atmosphere. busy place but we could easily run a conversation. good food and absolutely value for money. kind staff. will come back.
stopped in here on friday lunchtime after a bracing walk around the military defences. glad we d 
good service from koen and several food to chose. gives good atmosphere and enjoys your stay. reason to go more times
"if you are looking for a nice lunch place in the struytse hoeck shopping center, la place is the place to be (they do not have much more choice, unless you like dutch snack bars!) prices are reasonable and food is cooked made to order. the burgers are especially tasty! "
had a lovely dinner with the family. started with some bread and a nice bottle of white wonen. got a good advice to wat because i could niet choose from the menu.
"no guide michelin but honest good food. the meat was excellent as was the fish. next time were here, well go back."
"busy place and it was good we had reserved. nice people, good food and enjoyed our time there. i had a nice stake, my friend a nice piece of fish. for starters muscles and scrimps in a nice sauce. we took the wine arrangement, even got limonicello with my cheese cake as dessert. all in all, a nice experience."
"it was our second visit to de buren and we had a perfect diner! we come mainly for the steaks, my partner always orders the aged rib eye, and i am a filet fan! this time i had the tournedos classique (beef filet wrapped in bacon, with caramelized onions and mushrooms, in a madeira jus.) omg it was so tasty, cooked to perfection.they have a huge beer menu but we went for the long island ice tea cocktail this time, and they were delicious and perfectly balanced. the service is always great, both by kirsten and anouschka, thanks again for an amazing nig "
"for guinness drinkers, youll be pleased to know, they sell it here "
"this cozy eetcaf√© located within the old fortress area of hellevoetsluis reminds me of our english pubs back home.friendly,helpfull staff, great atmosphere, good service and good food."
"cafe de buren is in the center of hellvoetsluis and one of the liveliest bars. you can normally find a table tucked away from the bar to enjoy good quality, reasonably priced home cooked food. please note the burger is the size of a dinner plate, so you have to be hungry!"
"very good food, beer and service. the spare ribs and steak were excellent. the staff were frienly and very helpful."
dinner with 7 people. as it should be good food and drink and a friendly service. on sunday evening delivery at home. again excellent.
"we just recently spent two wonderful weeks in the citta romana resort (2 adults + 2 kids). during that time we also enjoyed a handful of dinners at the duinhoek which were all very good. our last dinner though was simply fantastic: black angus bbq ribs which were not only the best ribs i have ever enjoyed, but also fairly priced at ‚Ç¨50 for two persons. we were honored to talk to the chef and he explained everything around how long it took to prepare them (1,5-2 days). these ribs really redefined the meaning of the words tender and juicy. if we ever make it back to citta romana, these ribs will be part of the experience again :-)"
"we had the month menu at duinhoek, food was excellent. staff was friendly and professional. this was our second visit, and we will go back for more."
"nice friendly little place  small menu but well cooked &  presented food mix of styles, pizzas, steaks etc recommended eatery"
this offers comprehensive dining for the residents of citta romana and visitors alike. it is spacious and has a large outdoor terrace overlooking an ornamental pond.  service varies depending whos on duty and weather the neighbouring events hall is in use or not.
amazing food in a lovely environment with super staff. incredible ribs but everything else is great too. we have visited quite a few times this year (plus back in 2018) and i would rate it very highly every time. well done
"we were lucky enough to come across this lovely restaurant the other day. the owner and waitress were so helpful and so friendly it was an absolute pleasure. thats before i mention how delicious the food was. my husband had their signature dish which looked amazing and he absolutely loved. im coeliac and although the menu is not marked up for gluten free - dont be afraid to ask. the owner was so helpful and i appreciate so much her advice and care in preparing my meal...... the steak, sauce, specially prepared potato and vegetables were all delicious. we thanked them for a lovely evening."
"we had a very nice dinner and were pleased by the attent service en the quality and diversity of the food. we took the breadbasket before starter, interesting two types of dough baked together. starter goat cheese in filo dough and my friend a carpaccio. main course baked muscles for me, salmon with creamy orange saus, both very good. little ice cream as desert."
"we were welcomed in dutch but the staff immediately translated once they learnt we are english. the recommended dishes were superb. ribs were well up to standard, my wife had fresh venison - cooked perfectly. the wine was of a good standard but the only draught beer was heineken. bottled ales were available too thou "
hi great place every time we come to hellevoetsluis its a must. never fails.  just try it. the choice of menu is great and not to expensive.
very friendly staff and love the four course menu with asparagus. the ambiance is nice and cozy. the desert was delicious.
came across this restaurant by accident when strolling around the shopping centr 
"we happened to come across this place whilst at the shopping centre and decided to try it for lunch. the portions that other people were having were absolutely huge so we decided to go for the ‚Ç¨11 lunch menu. we both got indonesian pork with fried noodles and it was delicious and absolutely huge! we couldnt finish it all but we really enjoyed what we had. the service was very attentive and we thought it was incredibly good value for money. my only small criticism is that it was quite cold inside and even though the food was served on hot plates, my food went cold very quickly. "
"in shoppingcenter, above parking garage this indonesian-chinese restaurant. weve had several meals here and always good. typical chinese dutch but also different plates. let them surprise you. atmosphere is light, clean. you can also order take away. price -quality perfect"
"located in the main shopping center of this town with a nice atmosphere inside and very friendly service. the indonesian food was good, although not spectacular. they have a buffet too. recommended."
"loads of food at low cost. ultimate hangoverfood. would go back there tomorrow, to cure my hangover. best flied lice evel."
this must be the best restaurant in lemmer. what a great visit this was! nice staff and wonderful food. i will warmly recommend everyone who visit lemmer to also visit de baai van lemmer.
without a doubt the best restaurant in town and in the larger neighborhood. we were welcome with 3 ! amuses (in fact the third amuses was a combination of two: a spicy bitterbal and a small aspergesou 
"really enjoyed our experience here. a warm welcome to start. no english menu but waitress very happy to translate for us. the chef was leaving at 8pm so we could not order starters, only main dishes. however we were treated to little canap√©s until our main arrived. very decoratively presented meals and very tasty. definitely worth a visit"
i enjoyed an evening here with local frien 
"very friendly restaurant with excellent food.  we particularly enjoyed the asparagus soup, iberian wildboar and the tarbot fish."
"we had a family 70th birthday party here and it was great atmosphere. lovely food, great service. nice area for children to play. very family friendly restaurant."
"perfect place to enjoy the canal action,the small town activity, the locals and the tourists.perfect for  a group and for a family with children.good quality, fast service with a smile."
"we were with a group of 5 and had a good experience. we all loved our food, which was the main deal. a little disappointed in the waiting staff, they seemed a little inexperienced. therefore, no 5 stars, but the food wouldve be worth it!"
"good restaurant in the heart of lemmer. warm atmosphere, good food, friendly staff. must visit for pizza lovers!"
really friendly staff and the service was quick. went back the next day and he remembered us and our drinks. excellent!
"we were sitting outside the british pub, but i assumed we had dinner at ald lemm "
"we ate at the pub (outdoors). food is just how you would love it, we chose the liver, which is hard to get right most of the time. these guys just got it right, lovely taste, lovely additions, very neatly placed on your plate with anything you could dream of, and at a very affordable price. ok, most people would go for fish when at a water site, but this simply was not on our menu that very night. expecting not too bad quality, we were pleasantly surprised with the menu, and the servants. dont forget, they really have a great beer choice too !!!"
"do you want a night out in a nice, relaxing ambience, attentative service, mouth wathering, autentic food ? than this is the place ! go on a food journey with every dish a new explosion of flavors. the rijst tafel (many options) will give you a complete set of everything. portions are well sized so you will not leave hungry. we have lived 9 years in indonesia and have visited indonesisn restaurants in holland, this one trumps them all. everything is made fresh, so do not be in a rush, enjoy the time to stand still and talk....."
a great combination of an atmospheric old building offering great ambience with a modern high quality menu. have been here three times each two years apart and quality has been excellent each time. well worth picking as your choice in montfoo 
"we eat here  three times, every time the food was very good. the staff is very friendly. highly recommend."
"i think this is a nice restaurant, they serve good food and the staff is very friendly. i recommend it."
enjoyed a lovely christmas day dinner here. we had reserved a place and we were presented with a wonderful multi-coursed feast. we made our own selections within a preset listing for appetizers and main courses. wonderful! dessert was an assortment for each table with a variety of small samples that we thoroughly enjoyed. staff was very friendly and efficient in spite of the large group. the only downside was the above average noise level. overall a very pleasant experience. we will be returning!
one of the few restaurants which are open on a monday at lunch time.  we had an excellent lunch. average priced.  good service. especially with foreign customers there is an english menu. so you dont need to translate from dutch.
"het oude stadhuis is the place to be if you want to eat in a beautiful old dutch building. the place is small, the atmosphere is vibrant, the food is ok, a bit overpriced. but who cares in such beautiful surroundings."
"just arrived in holland after our ferry journey from harwich,england. staying on a local farm b&b. went to a local restaurant before our visit to the stadhuis. were told that they were closing due to no customers and the weathe "
i have had lunch here several times in the past and have never been disappointed. i cannot comment on their service at other times but at lunchtime the service has always been very friendly and helpful; the menu is fairly limited but i have never been disappointed with either the quality or the presentation of what is provided. at the price it would be hard to beat.
"attended the first sunday crooning event with laura fygi.show was great. food was excellent, and the staff were very attentive. all in all a fabulous afternoon, worth travelling from scotland to attend."
we had some lovely ice cream to go after a festive weekend. the flavors are really good. occasionally a flavor tastes a bit artificial. always a good place to buy some tasty treats.
"the ice cream is very tasty. they often have new and surprising flavors.  the location is nice, on the canal. there are some benches on the side of the street."
"daans droomijs is a icecream parlor near the hollandse ijssel in the center of montfoort. they serve homemade, original flavors."
working with fresh milk from local dairy farm the owner makes the most wonderful icecream. besides the classic flavors h√® also experiments with new creations. it is located in the lovely historic ceenter of montfoort on the river. in the summer you can sit outside and watch the boats come by.
"maybe not the most fancy restaurant as location, but the food is really nice. variated small luxurious dishes, not the standard meals, for everyone is there something nice. for the kids there is a nice playroom."
"excellent service, friendly staff, and a really lovely six course dinner at a very reasonable price.  highly recommend to those who like something different.  vegan and vegetarian friendly also!"
"size of the restaurant is middle. it is kind of classy but not too expensive. i really like the tapas here, not the standard meals."
"tried to update the listing to its new name pannenkoe ridderkerk, but the app did not process we "
"our first meal on this trip to holland. we enjoyed traditional dutch pancakes (just like the ones my dutch father makes) with untradtional toppings. my husband tried the french version (thinly sliced ham & brie), while i tried the italian (ham, mozzarella, tomato and basil). we shared a dish of ice cream for dessert, along with a good, strong cup of coffee to help combat the jet lag. our server was engaging and did her best to accommodate us in english. despite the busy dinner hour, service was prompt and efficient."
my sister and her friends are regular visitors to this restaurant and it came highly recommende 
last saturday had dinner here with my sister 
"nice location, very friendly waiters, good interior. burgers look very nice but meat is a beat tough, while very juicy. soup was great"
"the service is ok and the food here is good, a decent plate filled with fresh food, presented beautifully! the sphere is ok too, easy to have a large company for drinks and bites."
"food is pretty good, lots to choose from, drinks are super nice, will definitely come back! service is also very nice."
the concept of ordering small dishes in rounds is well known in sushi. but it was a small surprise when we found out that it was also possible with small french themed dish 
had a lovely coffee break with excellent cappuccino and warm apple cake. friendly and helpful staff.  the atmosphere was very relaxed. beautiful view over the river.
"relaxed atmosphere, great to enjoy the beautiful day we where having... staff was very helpfull en friendly. food was very good.."
"mixed menu, meat and fish in french kitchen and everything is good. however if there is a local activity going on like a market a fair or village celleberation, or you are short on time or not being dressed accordingly do not go here. it is a nice restaurant with nice staff and great food but you have to be willing take your time to enjoy the food. best is to reserve upfront. the owner is very friendly and likes to get to know his customers so one should be prepared ending up chatting with him."
"the food is really super. very good prices, prefer this to the beukelaar, across the road, which was a scam.  this place is nice, great garden, food and service. very clear, fair pricing. it was super."
we had lunch there with 10 people. everything was served fast and we got the food at the same time. food was nice.
"escaping the busyness of a holiday resort we looked for a place to have a family dinner. staff was nice and kids were given drawing material immediately. choice is plenty. the place wasnt packed as it was still early (around 18:00). food serving time was good especially when visiting with kids. our choice was a starter and main course which was good, nothing fancy. pricing is average."
"there were not too many british tourists travelling through sellingen but the staff all spoke perfect english. the restaurant was quiet but to be fair the weather was quite cool and stormy for september. the decor is clean and comfortable and food very good we are here twice and had the steak and the chicken satay & also the snitzel all very good, would recomme "
"we had a great time at kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel in s-heerenberg. the caf√© is in a beautiful location, near the impressive kasteel huis bergh. the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fresh and flavorful. we can recommend this caf√© to anyone looking for a unique and cozy experience in a historic setting."
good place for resting. rest is in beatiful. cheese sandwich is perfect. good ambiance for relaxing. thanks for all
"we went here for lunch with a gift certificate. the reception by the host was very welcoming. the weather was great so we sat on the terrace, in the shade of the nice trees with a view of the castle and the tower that houses one of the guest roo "
"good food and good service, very attentive. we were sitting outside in the sun with a great view at the castle"
the cafe next to the castle was very nice. the beer selection was great and the service friendly and good. the basic cheese sandwich was cheap and good and the tomato soup was amazing. only when i left did i notice a very small room next to the main dining area that is vey scenic. prices are really good despite being next to the castle. the food was generally lighter for lunch - it was lunch time when i was there.
"this caf√© / restaurant changed its name from grand caf√© heeren dubbel into kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel because it is located at the kasteel huis bergh (castle house bergh). the tickets for tours of the castle are even sold inside the restaurant. before or after your visit of the castle and gardens, you should have a drink outside or inside the kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel. the atmosphere is great. the staff is friendly and the food is good too. we will revisit this place!"
"what a beautiful setting, what lovely food and what wonderful service staff. we love this place and its wine selection. make sure to pay a visit to the castle while youre there!"
this is most probably the best restaurant in the town. very friendly service and the food is well prepared and with attention. we went back a few times and it‚Äôs recommended to go there.
amazing ambiance. this hours is very expensive. but meals is good. thanks for all stuff. the night lights look very nice.
"we had a good and affordable 2 course dinner at snouzen! staff was friendly and approachable.  the restaurant is centrally located, near the hotel de lantscroon."
"a nice restaurant in the middle of the city on a central place. you can also arrive there with car. the menu is only dutch and german but an english version would be fine. the personel is very friendly and quick. clean, modern and warm at the same time. mmmmm the food excellent. tasty and portions pleanty enough. a nice please to visit aga "
"situated in the heart of the picturesque city of s-heerenberg, this restaurant has a lovely and cozy terrace. the food we had for lunch was very good and not expensive at all. brilliant service!"
"we only had a quick lunch after our walk in the natural park, which is close by. the park is a must see, when you in this area and when you like to walk. the pancakes are very good. coffee and bakery is fine. the service is friendly and ok. the dining-room feels as a close connection to nature"
went for a stroll round the park then eat in the pancake house. excellent pancakes both savoury and desert. young friendly staff look after you. give this place a go if you are in the area.
"descending from the highway a7 at the petrol station van der valk offers you a reliable quality and good service, for an acceptable price.."
"to ensure we could make it until dinner time, we made a stop here to grab a bite between 2 and 3 in the afternoon. my partner picked a 12-oclock (twaalf uurtje), a selection of small bites, served nicely on a plate. apparently, very tasteful. i had a wrap, filled with chicken fillet, salad and a tasty dressing (heksenboter). also, very enjoyab "

"we have eaten here many times: cappuccino and vlaai (prune) and apple tart; high tea; lunch (salad and sandwich and frites; and, dinner. we have never been disappointed. first of all, the cook(s) give attention to detail. the food is not only fresh and local and delicious but it is presented beautifully. the vlaai is the best i have ever eaten and i am not able to enjoy it anywhere else as there is no comparison to the way it is made at paul‚Äôs. the ice-cream is rich and creamy and there are many flavors. the cappuccino is a real italian cappuccino ‚Äì the best in zuid limburg. the high tea is so fun and tasty and a lovely setting to enjoy with friends and family. the lunch menu is tasty and dinner menu is also very good. this is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù restaurant in the area as the food is fresh and so good. when the weather is nice the outdoor seating is comfortable. inside the restaurant, you have a visual delight. we highly recommend this restaurant and their wonderful flavorful menu and service. note: this is not just an ice-cream place, this is a wonderful full menu restaurant. as a vegetarian, i am always able to get a delicious meal. highly recommend the quiche. husband loves the margraten belgium blue steak."
"they make their own icecream as i was told, the flavors are amazing. the entourage is also very nice."
"we had a high tea here on a sunday afternoon. the location is very good, it had a very warm atmosphere. we got a lot of explanation of all the food served. they serve many special tea flavors which is very nice. the quality of the food was good and they serve generous portions. "
we came here for lunch after a walk to visit the windmi 
"a perfect place to have dinner. good quality food, prices are maybe a bit on the high side, but every euro worth. nice ambiance in the caf√©, nice personnel."
"great beer and fantastic service!! the bar server, leonie went above and beyond expectations. my husband and i had a couple beers at the lovely restaurant (and they even stayed open longer than they had too just for us). i accidentally left my jacket there and had to leave the next morning so couldnt pick it up. leonie sent it to me all the way to the us. i highly recommend this restaurant for fantastic service and great food and drinks."
"nice place, good food, options for vegetarians and gluten free plates. the service was really welcoming. we really suggest this restaurant!"
"at lunch, the person behind the bar and the waiter on the dining room floor wove through the crowd serving everyone in an efficient manner and were very hospitable. a few nice local beers on tap along with wine by the glass was a fine compliment to out traditional dutch sandwiches (cheese sandwich) with fresh ingredients and hearty breads. definitely a local feel vs. touristy."
while staying in zaanse schans we dined in this restaurant which was right opposite our apartment. the service was very attentive by a lovely young lady and the food was very substantial and tasty. the place is very old in and outside.it is very quaint and has been well maintained. will certainly come again if we are ever in amsterdam again. highly recommend.
have dinner here. you won‚Äôt regret it. we shared a platter selection of all the starters (fantastic) and then enjoyed our desserts!
"was completely charmed by this cosy little spot right in front of the windmill (sorry i cant remember the name). mika was a wonderful host and we absolutely loved the mustard soup with eel and homemade fresh bread! the spinach and cheese ravioli was simply a party-in-your-mouth experience! we also ordered the steak and fries, while the steak was good, we absolutely loved the fries! i don‚Äôt know what that used to make those fries, but it‚Äôs the best i‚Äôve ever tasted! my friend and i are were craving a mocha coffee and for some reason, there was none available from the shops we visited. mike was gracious enough to make us some and it was simply divine! we suggested she add this to her menu, especially since you can smell the rich fresh aroma of cacao that permeates throughout the area. the reason there‚Äôs a strong chocolate scent, is there is a chocolate plant in the heart of the little village. initially, we couldn‚Äôt make out the scent but it only took seconds for our olfactory nerves to identify it, & signal that information to our brain! outstanding service, food, price, & ambiance! "
"this place has just made our day, and trip in a certain way. it turned out to introduce us to the exquisite dutch cuisine as we were waiting for and were sort of unable to find in amsterd "
"after visiting zaanse schans we were looking for lunch. cross the bridge back toward the train station and find slager ann de schans. its a local restaurant with authentic food, without the tourist crowd. the croquettes and ham-and-cheese sandwich were excellent. the wine list is very reasonable. our waitress was friendly with excellent english. best meal weve had in holland."
while visiting the area we fund this little place. in the menu there is something for everybody and it was excellent.
visiting the netherlands and am staying nearby. dinner was incredible. very good pricing and variety on the menu. they also were great in accommodating me with a take out order for my daughter. will definitely eat here again before i leave to go home. the staff are wonderful. 
the service was fast and friendly. the food was delicious and tasty.  the sandwiches were fresh and delicious.  definitely recommend
"we went to slagers for lunch on the way and dinner on the way back to the train from zaanse schans. the hot ginger tea is lovely and we both enjoyed the vegetarian open sandwich on their dark brown bread. at dinner myles had the steak and chips, which was cooked to perfection, and i had the ravioli, lovely fresh pasta."
"i had one of the best seared tunas ever! just cooked to perfection! the atmosphere is really authentic, being an old historic slaughterhouse building. service was impeccable too. thank you!"
"this place is a must if you are planning to visit zaanse schans. their interior, ambience, services was amazing. we ordered their 3 course menus which was very tasty especially their duck and fish! i am a satisfied customer"
"was recommended by host at apartment 2 minutes away. we were talked through the set menu (28 euros, 3 courses) by the waitress as all in dutch. decided to choose options from that. it was all very nicely done and the starter ( smoked duck with pickles) in particular was very interesting and nothing like id ever had before. desert ( tarte tatin) was a bit small ( cut in half!?) and fish filet not large either but plenty of food as 3 courses. environment was rustic but felt authentically dutch."
"we stopped to take rest during local windmill visit. very nice place, tasty desserts, polite waitresses. my advise is to stop after the windmill visit.  ci siamo fermati dopo aver visitato i mulini. cameriere simpatiche e gentili, posto carino e dessert molto buoni. consigliato."
nice selection of open type sandwiches and toasties for lunch.  great location which allowed us to fuel up before walking around the windmills on an unuaslly hot day.  cash only too when i was there.
"you will love this place. the interior has been well decorated and kept in his original state. great choise menu, good food and wine at a very reasonable price."
"a very nice, elegant place with gourmet dishes. it also has a small terrace. the fowl was very good, deserts also."
had lunch during a visit to zaanse schans windmills. the burger was delicious. tip: free seating outside restaurant so pick a table and the waitress will pop by.
"we were referred to this brasserie by a local as we walked across the bridge from zaanse-schans. it was a perfect recommendation! the restaurant is charming and we truly enjoyed the food. we were there alone for a while and had a great conversation with the server. our sandwiches were very fresh and yummy. it started to fill up with people and we quickly realized that we made a great choice. if the weather is good, theres lots of outside dining. one of our best lunches during our trip to amsterdam!"
we were really impressed with this resturaunt. the atmosphere with two wonderfully tiled fireplaces and an excellently prepared delicious meal made this stop a lovely ending to a busy day. our sever was pleasant and proffesional. the resturaunt is under new ownership and you can tell they really care. there is plenty of street parking near by and the prices are much more reasonable here than on the historic site (windmills) near by. for 3 of us we paid 95 euros a la carte with drinks alcohol and coffees. 
"had a lunch at christmas, expected standard menu, but it was as special chrisrmas lunch. very supprising fine dinner."
"my boyfriend and i had lunch at de smuiger on our way to visiting zaanse schans. the food was really good. due to the nice weather we were able to eat outside on the terrace. the terrace is big, with nice views of a windmill. on walking distance of zaanse schans. and very good price/quality. friendly and helpfull staff."
"when a friend and i were taking a ferry to zaanse schans, a fellow-traveller told me she and her friend would be having lunch at de smuiger, which she said is very good. so we tailed them to the restaurant, which was quietly located, away from the hordes of tourists besetting zaanse schans. the building is absolutely gorgeous, named after the beautifully tiled fireplaces, and has an interesting histo "
"after walked from train station to windmills area in zaanse schans, my daughter and i felt hungry. then we decided to stop at one restaurant that we saw in our midway. it was nice place and cosy with wooden architecture. unique interior design made me feel comfortable and relax inside. we ordered drink and meals too. they have very delicious soup (in my opinion) which is very tasty. i forgot the name, it was kind of seafood soup. my daughter doesnt really like soup. but when she tasted mine, she definitely ordered another one for herself too. next time if i come back to netherlands, i really want to come to this place again and order the soup. the owner is kind and helpful too. price is reasonable. i recommend this place. "
"we had lunch here while visiting zaanse schans. a group of 9 of us and we sat at 2 separate tables beside each other because it wasnt originally planned to be so many of us. the food was great! the chicken nuggets are great - panko breaded white meat, not dry at all. the tomato basil soup was really good, and the curry chicken sandwich was great. the fries were also really good. good beer too! just a short walk over the bridge from zaanse schans."
"not sure if it was dutch cuisine but it was beyond amazing. my boyfriend and i stopped by this nice restaurant after our visit to the windmills across the river. we indulged on a space cake few hours before eating and got the best munchies ever! amazing appetizers, highly recommend the crispy beef wonton soup and the steak tartare, tasty bitterballen and delicious desserts!! we had the lemon pie and cheesecake. will definitaley come back if we have a chance. üëçüèª"
"delicious food, outstanding service and charming location. do yourself a favor and come to this amazing restaurant. we just loved it"
"ive landed in this cafe after a walk in zaanse schaans. it is a great place to chil out after visiting this beautiful area. try to have a table outside in the sun, enjoying a view of the near big windmill."
"happened to drive past this restaurant. its a bit of fusion with chinese food. real good quality ingredients and friendly service. happy to recommend to anyone looking for a good, wholesome meal for the family."
we saw this pretty little restaurant on our walk from the train station to the zaans museum. we popped in for coffees and liked it so much we returned for lunch. the staff were very friendly and helpful. everything from sandwiches and soup to pasta dishes and great desserts. beer on tap and the biggest toasted cheese sandwich i have ever had. all lovely. a very historic and pretty building and right opposite a huge windmill
"food is really good. i tried salmon as starter and fish of the day. all tasty and tempting presentation. a bit disappointed by the dessert, i ordered a carrot cake but tiny slices and more whipped cream and ice cream, nothing to complain about the presentation. highly recommended!"
"very friendly staff, popped in for a drink, would book lunch or dinner  if visiting windmills. relaxing place to sit, or have a fine dining experience"
"i have had the pleasure of eating here on more than one occasion, the chef and all the kitchen staff are amazing and so talented, the restaurant is beautiful and the menu is out of this world"
"really nice place, friendly staff, good food. free and good access to wifi. pop up for a coffee or a snack before or after visiting the windmills."
walk over the bridge from zaanse schans and across from the windmill is this delightful restaurant. a nice menu selection for lunch and dinner. we choose the salads and they were delicious. recommend by the locals for good reason.
"on a whim we decided to cycle to find some food on the last night of our holiday. we liked the look of the menu and decided to try it out. best way of describing the food would be a fusion of european and asian. starters were chinese vegetable dumplings and scallops. both dishes were well presented and very tasty. mains were lamb chops & roast duck in plum sauce. the duck was well cooked, tasty and tender. while i ordered the coconut milk pannacotta, my partner ordered the desert taster, expecting small portions of a sample of the deserts, what arrived was almost full portions of at least 5 dessert "
"just stopped for a drink after visiting the windmills. very well done up old place, lots of wood, nicely decorated."
"we were happy to have such a good diner with this place. the way the wines are described, was very good. to find words for a taste is rather unique. well done."
"when you travel the world as i do there is one thing that happens thats not so good, and that is that few places amaze me. this restaurant is the exception, it is utterly amazing!!!!! i loved it!! "
"we had taken the little ferry from zaanse schans on a whim. after wandering down a lovely small zaan region village we happened on de smuiger and decided to try it for lunch. the decor is lovely and has incorporated the features of the building and its history well. i ordered mustard soup with a salad that featured avocado and a light herbal dressing. my husband had a luncheon salad with thinly sliced tuna, monk fish, and pickled ginger. we both very much liked our choices. and the rolls were warm, served with a choice of garlic herbed butter or olive tapenade. service was warm and professional. definitely go here for lunch if in the neighborhood. it is just over the bridge from zaanse schans and to the left and across the street from a windmill."
dropped in for cuppaccino & soaked in the atmosphere of zaandijk. good break on the walking route around the windmill zone.
"this restaurant is located right across the bridge from the zaanseschans on the left side at the.traffic light. it serves lunch specials that are fusion with a hint of chinese. dutch, english and cantonese are spoken he "
"we stayed across the road & found this place one evening. we were lucky to get a table & were a bit worried bringing our toddler in. but the staff were so friendly & the food was amazing, & we had a great time! they offer 3 course meals with starter, main & dessert, but we avoid sugar so they allowed us to have a soup, starter & main instead. the soups were creamy & rich & delicious. the dumplings were so tasty - everything we had was absolutely amazing! lovely little area as well!"
we were staying in this area and were delighted to discover this delightful restaurant. we couldnt have been made more welcome. when she saw we were interested in the building our hostess showed us the cellar and the tiny bedroom! the food was the best we ate in a week in amsterdam! a must if you are visiting zaanse schans which is just down the road! the food is best described as chinese fusion.
we ate at de smuiger with two couples. the restaurant is located in a building typical for the area and breaths a monumental atmosphere. service was friendly and efficient. the menu contains set multiple course menus or you can select one by one. the food was very tasty and also the wine turned out really good. would return.
"i live in the neighborhood and we go here for dinner on special occasions, even x-mas! excellent food and very special ambiance. good to combine with a stroll at the zaanse schans, on your way to the railway station!"
"loved it - unique three, four or five course menus. attentive service and great dutch food. fancy place but were welcomed in jeans. reservations recommended but we got lucky with the last space availalbe"
"amazing food and service. loved the dishes we got to try with the family. this was our first night in arnhem, so glad we found this place to start off our vacation."
"we, party of four, opted for the lobster menu. refined taste and very well presented. good and affordable wine li "
"what a great surprise in the small village of oosterbeek to find such a wonderful restaurant. great service,, food cooked to perfection and a really nice atmosphere  will come back"
"very nice food, a surprising explosion of tastes. good service, peculiar colorful decor with quality materials. good selection of wines, we also got a free wine upgrade being the last clients. not to mention that after 8:30 pm this was the only open restaurant in the area (they kept us in until midnight)."
"amazing food and service, best umami taste ev "
walked miles from wolfheze to get here for evening meal because it was vegan friendl 
"i like tjoes restaurant because it is vegetarian and the food is of high quality. it has a menu fixe, different everyday. the menu is creative. the atmosphere is convivial and the service is warm and kind. it is the kind of little place in town that one wants to have around the corner: friendly, homey, delicious and healthy. and they have begun to sell local products as well."
"you will think its not easy to find a vegetarian restaurant in a small town like oosterbeek but youre wrong. tjoes offers you good, delicious vegetarian food. they have a daily menu so you dont need to choose one. all is fresh. service is very personally. the restaurant is not on the mainstreet but with your gps you will find it easily. by the way, the dessert is yummy. youd better make a reservation as it was quite busy that evening when were there."
"located on the weverstraat 20, tjoes is a small restaurant. you have only a day-menu, so the choice is easy. prices are reasonable and the food tastes good. what else do you want? it might sometimes be wise to make a reservation, but we could do without booking in advanced and enjoyed sitting on the big table. you can check the website for the daycourse."
i am a vegetarian and getting only vegetarian food with variety in netherlands was something difficult to find. my manager took me to this dutch vegetarian restaurant and i was really happy to end my day with a good vegetarian meal. the food served is fresh and tasty. i would love to go to this place for lunch or dinner atleast once a week or whenever i would vis 
"as a meat lover i was rather sceptical about going to a vegetarian restaurant. but what a nice surprise! the choice of the card is limited, which i see as a sign that what you will get is fresh. and everything was amazingly fresh and of very good quality. we had the daily menu of a vegetable flan, similar to a frittata, roasted winter vegetables and a lovely salad. all members of the family finished their plates with great joys (even the children who usually are not fond of vegetables!). we decided to go on with deserts. most of us had a wonderful chocolate truffle cake, with a deep taste of chocolate, that went well down with the vanilla ice cream. we also had a surprisingly wonderful orange parfait with a lavender sauce. all in all a wonderful evening out for a very affordable price. i had never thought i would enjoy, and stay full, like this after a vegetarian meal!"
we discovered this great little vegetarian restaurant in oosterbeek nl. not far from arnhem. it is not on a main road so you have to look for it. but it will be worth you whil 
"to be honest: we didnt expect much. the interior of the restaurant and the type of customers dining here didnt promise a lot. but the place was open and near our hotel. we didnt feel like looking around too much for a place to eat, so we took a chance "
"la maison is excellent and highly recommended when visiting oosterbeek. i was with a group of 18 people who arrived close to closing time and they were able to accommodate us - which is exceptional service. the food was delicious and well presented, with serving sizes that comfortably allow a two or three course meal. we liked it so much we went back a second time during our visit (and would go back again next time we are in oosterbeek)."
"this is a family owned restaurant, with an excellent menu, and very friendly staff. it is within 7 minutes cycling from the bilderberg hotel, and has an outside terrace. the food is excellent, which made us decide to come back the next evening of our stay. we can recommend the fish dishes, and for meat eaters the sateh, although everything looked good on the me "
"as a local we quite often go here for diner, especially when we have friends over at our place. la maison calls itself a brasserie that can be considered an understatement realizing the quality of food the restaurant provides. the menu offers a good variety of options rather you are a lover of meat, fish or vegetarian. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed; our 6 year old daughter loves to join us here as well. decoration is based on the la maison chain of interior stores of which one is situated next door."
"we had dinner on a busy saturday eve when many other restaurants were fully booked. service was very friendly and the meal great and reasonably priced: as starter lobster soup and goat-cheese and veal as mean course. the atmosphere is friendly. the only point of improvement is the acoustics, it can be pretty noisy. outside there is a nice terrace which must be great on a sunny day. "
"with a social deal we had a meal here for the first time. and after this meal it is definitely not the last time we will visit it. portions were very big, and tasted very well, staf was very friendly. so if you are in the neighbourhood you have to visit it"
"finding a restaurant is always fun , part of the pleasure is to see if the recommendations are to your taste , here it was .downside is the small menu ,so the picky diner has to compromise. food is good and well presented ."
we were visiting oosterbeek mainly to see the airborne museum and operation market garden sites. we were running late and did not get to have lunch until 4.00pm. we looked at the restaurant next door to the museum but the prices were astronomical so we walked further along the road and came across la maison. the place was empty except for the staff. we were quickly seen; our order was quickly taken and the food arrived in good time. the food was lovely and we had excellent service. we would recommend la maison to anyone who is visiting the the area.
stopped here for lunch while staying in oosterbeek. friendly staff spoke good english & we ordered a club sandwich & the house burger/frites. both were excellent with that netherlands twist that makes them a little difference from the usual fare.
a great little find. this is a boutique style restaurant in a quiet village. if you are near arnhem it is woth the 7km detour. food is great. prices are very good. staff are friendly.
the first night of our 14 day holidays in oosterbeek we opted to have dinner at la maison. lovely decor and lots of outdoor light fill the restaurant. the menu was divers and very reasonably priced. also our two daughters (10 & 12) found something of their likin 
"we had a meeting in oosterbeek for a next walking event. in preparation of a not really exciting moment we had dinner in this excellent restaurant. perfect attentive personnel, excellent food and  quiet ambiance. we will be back here for sure !!"
"we were walking back from oosterbeek towards arnhem, and came across this newly opened treasure. the food was freshly cooked, service was superb, they could not do enough to please. the dishes were absolutely delicious, and the presentation was excellent as you will see from my pictures!"
"came here for lunch with family, the main courses were okay. the pudding on the other hand (profiteroles) was delicious. good atmosphere"
"visited this restaurant spontaneously and had a very pleasant experience. all dishes (2x pancakes, 2x other mains) were delicious and served simultaneously. service was friendly and with a personal touch. prices are ok. the atmosphere is really cosy and welcoming. parking is available in front of the restaurant. recommended."
we stopped here for lunch on a saturday while visiting the airborne museum. my main course was okay (chicken satay). my pudding (profiteroles) was really gre 
"there are a lot of pancake restuarants. this is one of them. the menu is not different from other pancake restaurants. neither are the pancakes: they are good, but not excepttionally. the prices seem a bit high for the locatrion (samen prices as in amsterdam, but it is not amsterdam.. "
"ordered the chef‚Äôs menu - mushroom soup and salmon (fish of the day), and pork satay both dishes come with ample fried and a small salad. the house wine was excellent as well as the affligem 0% bee "
"on our short visit to holland , we stumbled on this cozy restaurant. we were surprised with the most tasteful pannekoeken"
"great place to eat, need to book if want to be inside at busy times. (always busy when we were there in september.) outside is covered and there are heaters. friendly professional staff, good menu."
we have visited here numerous occasions as part of a group on a battlefield tour and always been made extremely welcome. this is a jovial place with staff who are eager to please and good food (and beer) to complete the mix.
previous reviews looked good so we decided to try here we were not disappointed..party of 5 we had burgers x 2 pork satay x 1 chicken satay x 1 veggie burger x 1..all the food was well presented and everyones plate ended up empty! lovely food and the waitresses/waiter were extremley pleasant alongside the relaxed friendly atmosphere..we will be definately eating here again on our next visit.
"my wife and i ate here on the last night of a 6-night stay in belgium and holland. it was the best place on our trip - good hearty food (with a wide choice of pancakes as well), friendly and welcoming owners, and (as we found everywhere we went in holland) polite and helpful young table staff. if you are visiting arnhem and oostabeek we would thoroughly recommend you searching this place out - it is only a short walking distance from the airborne museu "
"we stayed here for two nights. the rooms were large and comfortable with good beds and a good bathroom. we even had a small balcony. the surroundings are magical! everywhere you go, you feel like youre in a fairytale. staff of the inn were friendly and breakfast was good."
"we had just gotten to oosterbeek, staying at the hotel de bilderberg. we wanted lunch but not at the hotel. de oude herbergh is a short walk away. the food was good and had a relaxed environment. the service was good. they have plenty of outside seating."
"wonderful pancakes, great prices, relaxed atmosphere. a real find. had a really nice evening with my son."
"we battled to find somewhere for an early breakfast around oosterbeek. our group of nine pitched up here just as the place opened for breakfast at 09.00. the staff looked a bit shell shocked & daunted by the prospect of having to cater for so many people so early in the working day but soon got into their stride & coped very well. we ordered a variety of dishes; fruit & yoghurt, cheese and ham croissants, eggs & bacon on toast - unfortunately the pancakes weren‚Äôt available until 11.00 hrs. coffees & teas & orange juice accompanied the meal. pleasant place with parking. "
"what‚Äôs not to like? excellent food, loaded pancakes or superb satay. omelettes or steak. there is something here for everyone. easy to park, tables inside or out. if you‚Äôve got a large group you need to expect to sit across a few tables- it‚Äôs easier in any case. fabulous service and musical entertainment with a little comedic flair. great food, lots of it and good beer. "
"we stopped at this restaurant twice whilst on an op. market garden tour, one one occasion we had snacks from the lunch menu , the pancakes were excellent, plate sized, very generous. the sandwiches were also tasty. friendly staff i would recommend."
"such a beautiful little place on a slightly busy corner.  you can enjoy drinks or a meal outside.  we had onion soup (top notch!) and pannekoeken, and they had an excellent portuguese wine by the glass."
"stopped here for lunch before heading to the airbourne museum and i can only say wow. the staff were very friendly, excellent english which was a pleasure as my dutch is non-existent. the atmosphere was excellent and the restaurant is large with lots of parki "
"a quaint restaurant caf√© at the side of the main road, with a good menu choice and with friendly and pleasant staff. the pancakes were excellent, and all meals served to our group of 4 were really nice. good value too. would definitely go back here again. car park was a little small. a popular spot for visiting cyclists."
after our visit to the airborne museum we chose to have lunch in this restaurant which is only two minutes by car down the roa 
we have enjoyed several delicious meals at de oude herbergh with excellent customer service every time.
"i had 2 lunches at this restaurant with excellent food both times. the fried mushrooms on toast were slightly spicy and the pancake with cheese,mushrooms, onions and bacon filled the large plate. on both visits the staff were friendly and welcoming."
"we were in the area for three days. we had every meal had at this place, including breakfa "
"we stayed in the b&b part of this place and we enjoyed the restaurant. we sat outside on a rainy day and enjoyed a few cocktails before ordering. the waiter talked us into ordering an ‚Äúoosterbeek pancake‚Äù. ok kind of hard to explain but i‚Äôll try. it is a fat crepe that is covered with different combinations of good things like meats, cheese, and vegetables. it is not folded and comes to the table flat. it was a lot of food and delicious. always like to try local food and this was really good. great restaurant with a great b&b; this place is a winner and i would come back again."
"very nice restaurant, there was nice, friendly atmosphere. our waitress was really friendly and helpful. food was delicious and drinks were good too."
"the pancake with mushrooms, bacon and egg was nice, but th√© pofertjes, oh my!!! the best of my life. ate a double portion and could come here everyday ! better i dont live here otherwise i would become huge ;)!!!"
"very nice restaurant with local flavor and excellent, very friendly, service. i had pork tenderloin skewer with peanut sauce, my wife had barbequed spareribs. both very tasty!"
"got to say that i dont know how original dutch restaurant looks like but i think this is pretty close. practical layout, big patio, staff with their stylish brown leather aprons and unique salty pancakes makes this restaurant a place to visit. been eating here regurarly between july-november 2016 and still not bounteous of their pancakes."
"also know as the pancake house the de oude herbergh (the old inn) has been in existence for over a hubdred years. the specialise in pancakes but also have a very good menu of other meals, the ribs being excellent. sander and miranda own the establishment and are excellent hosts if your in oosterbeek or even arnhem for a meal. its very busy at peak times so a reservation is generally needed. the staff speak in dutch english and german so no problems there. all in all well worth a visi "
"we went tonight for dinner, very good service and nice food, the prices are very good gor nl and very good quality of food. i recommend goat cheese salat and the fish."
"popped in here without a reservation and they managed to fit us in. was lovey to be able to sit outside on a sunny evening. the staff were friendly and helpful, very forgiving of my limited dutch. we had the carpaccio of beef and smoked salmon to start, both were really nice and generous portion sizes. the carpaccio was particularly good. then for mains the pork escalope was really good, the spare ribs were good enough but avoid if you dont like your sauce swee "
"we stopped here for lunch & were able to sit outside as the weather was warm. friendly attentive staff serving local food, beer & pancakes"
"the best thing about this restaurant is that they really think about the details. lots of toys for the children and a present when they leave, nougat and biscuits with your coffee. the food is mostly pancakes or traditional dutch/european cuisine. nothing too fancy but nice enough and friendly staff."
"came her whilst staying locally on business. staff were welcoming to a solo traveller and service was excellent. i ordered salmon which took a while to arrive but was obviously freshly cooked so excusable. fries were excellent and there was a pleasant salad as a side. sauce with the salmon was a sour creame and chive which worked well. salmon was a substantial size. desert menu was limited, as it has been all around here, but the creame br√ªl√©e i had was fine but not perfect. at 28 euros including a large fresh orange this was good val "
"recommend to everyone to try chefs soup (pea soup) and their pancakes, they are just amazing. the place is very cozy and the the service is also very good."
"enjoy good old fashioned comfort and hospitality. the name pannenkoekenrestaurant (aka pancake restaurant) does not do this place justice. we ate a lovely fish meal here (sliptong). you could even spend the night, because it is also a bed and breakfast. we would come back here again and order the same delicious meal."
"delicious food, friendly and efficient staff and superb value for money. the mustard soup and sate were excellent, the generous portions meant i didnt get to try the puddings."
"we loved the savoury pancakes, try the special pancake with spek, ham, cheese, onion and paprika. deliciou "
"staying at a nearby hotel, we passed this on our way into nearby arnhem. the terrace was rammed (friday night), so on our way back to the hotel, we stopped for a quick beer to browse the menu, hoping to book for saturday. the three of us all chose the ribs as they looked amazin "
"excellent service, great food, great wines, must go if you stay at the hotel. the scenery is very old style rustic and worthwile spending your night here."
we were looking for an authentic dutch dining experience and we found it at de oude herbergh. the menu is all in dutch but the wait staff was very helpful in deciphering the menu. the place was full on a thursday evening with dutch families.
we have eaten here several times as my wife loves their pancakes. in our experience it is best to reserve a table if you can although the hard working english speaking staff seem to find a table on most occasion 
"we didnt realize this was also a place to stay -- we had dinner here only. it was very good! we wanted the traditional pannenkoeken, and they did not disappoint! large portions -- more than we could eat. kind of like a pizza but on the pancake. our waitress was very helpful and spoke english. they were very busy -- full of locals which is always a good sign!"
"the westerbouwing is on a sandwall which was created in the ice-age and is in the middle of flat land this way the views over arnhem and nimwegen are spectacular. the restaurant itself is located more in the forrest in a fabulous building with a huge window, which gives the feeling that you are in the wood!!!"
i was particular about visiting this place since it has strategic importance in ‚Äú operation market garden‚Äù.being at a higher level than oosterbeek village it would have made immense sense for the british to occupy this ridge and have their hq here. it is not known why brits did not occupy this place. so i took the foot path from road in front of ferry point and climbed up to the top from where there is beautiful view of river front.there is function hall on top with activity only when functions are held there.
"have a meal, a drink or a coffee and consider what took place here in september 1944 - this is a prime site to have an overview of the events of those days."
the restaurant overlooks the rhine with magnificent views and for this that are interested it was the sight of german guns that overlooked the river where the paras retreated from in 1944. the terrace is very pleasant and popular and the beer very good.
"relax atmosphere, good service and nice choices. good location with many outdoor tables. good for kids and families. ice cream and potatoes chips are always a good choice"
"eventually the place to end up for a casual night out in elburg! either you are traveling solo or in a group, you are never alone. a very good selection of beers and other spirits in combination with very tasty dishes makes the tapperij the place to be‚Ä¶"
"we had a great time at this quirky little restaurant in elburg! you do indeed feel like being on an old ship, they have done great work recreating this cozy atmosphere. the staff was very nice and enthusiastic and the food is great. highly recommended!"
"cant comment on the food as we didnt eat here - that said the tables that were eating seemed very happy. went for drinks, & warmly welcomed. lovely ambience, oodles of charm and character.....happy to recommend it and look forward to returning one day."
sitting on the restaurant‚Äòs terrace in nice elburg on a lovely summer evening is a must for every vistor. food was good and the burger excellent -tasty meet. aperol was chilled and fresh.
nice and warm place in the middle of such a beautiful town - elburg. one can try typical elburg‚Äôs cake called - ‚Äúkloosterwegge‚Äù.
"we had lunch in this establishment, sat outside on the terrace and enjoyed the view. the lunch was delicious and the capacino really great..."
what is the right time to dine in the netherlands ? this was a great discovery after some afternoon drinks. we all decided to stay and what a find it was. service was outstanding with our wait staff spending time to translate the menu and make recommendations. rather than some rather ordinary food in other establishments our meals were tasty and showed the quality of local produce. this establishment must be visited if you are in town.
"lovely cozy restaurant in the historic heart of elburg. very cheerful and professional staff. all the food was great, well presented with fresh vegetable garnish and delicious sauces. we tried the porkloin with brie, wolffish with prawns and the sparerib "
nice restaurant to be seen. nice location and good atmosphere. good menu. good selection of drinks and beers. service is good. casual dressing.
one of the best restaurants in elburg. its location is really good. sitting outside when it is sunny is great. food are delicious and well served. staffs are nice and polite.
"we were two famielies with children. day was rainy so we looked for welcoming place to eat. the service was excellent and all dishes were tasty, rates very resonable.wi fi is strong and stable. very reccomend this place!"
"just a quick stop over on our way to zewolde, recommended in a sailing book about holla "
"we went there on easter monday for dinner and this choice was good. the food tasted very well and was prepared to perfection. a 3 course meal for ‚Ç¨ 26,50 brings a smile to the face, especially for this quali "
well equiped caf√© that deserves the prefix grand. bar has a great assortiment. friendly and nice staff. enjoyable public. perfect to meet before the ensuit cinema and after.
the food and service was excellent. all the meals i saw going to other tables looked good. we went to the bar next door another evening and the cinema which is all part of the same building. the films are all in english with subtitles so great for  
i dont think the dutch are known for their cuisine but the luxor does a nice job of presenting it with style and taste.
"what you see is what you get. not over pretentious. close to a wonderful hiking area this is a great place for a lunch and a belgian, dutch or german beer. friendly and swift service. not too forget great chats with other guests. dog and horse friendly. good kitchen. lovely icecream coupes. and did i mention reasonable prices? "
my husband and i are on low carbs lifestyle (not the strict one) & we wanted to eat out in our last evening in reuv 
nice to wok here. the food is variabel and the sauces are also very good. friendly people and always alot to do.
"there are 3 types of way the food is cooked here. tempura, wok and prepared. all of it is hot and tasty and you can go back again and again. good variety of things that can be cooked as you watch! clean tables and floors. staff were friendly and welcoming. they also do takeaway!"
"went just before christmas; was busier than expected. we had not made reservations, but could choose from three different tables. friendly personnel, swift service. staff knows what they are selling and give good information about their dish "
having heard good references on this place we decided to try it ourselves when we wanted to get together as nephew 
"great to enjoy italian food, specially when the restaurant maintains the no pizza standard. so its the antipasto, a primo and a secundo and the dolce afterwards. great smooth carpaccio, antipasto misto followed by some filled pasta or straight & specials e.g. their special al tartufo. the menu changes each month so dont expect the real treat, rodlofos veal liver, the fegato veneziana, to be there, but boy, did i enjoy that! the rag√∫ we had was a bit dull, had it ten times better in bologna, but you cant win them all. great open wines, fine cakes. a bit on the pricy side, but friendly professional crew."
limoncello for everybody by the owner. no discrepancy by table .  gives more klantvriendelijkheid.  see you  next time
"unlike many restaurants attached to hotels, this one is absolutely hu "
great place to have a lunch diner or breakfast  good staff and good food nice ambiance reasonally priced
"working together with van der valk on our events and meetings, means we spend a lot of time at their restaurant. thats far from a punishment! dinner is excellent and service is gre "
perhaps more suitable as a business hotel - but handy for delft and rotterdam not sure about the carpets in the bedrooms - slightly headache inducing
"i had dinner with business partners. the menu offers a nice variation of food, as well as nice wines. try out and enjoy!"
i have been using this hotel since 2010 not only for cricket teams and officials but also for personal friends from around the world. they ask always say you could not have found a better restaurant
when you order you will get your food quickly.. you have lots of variety.. look on there website for the menu! sometimes they offer special deals on it to! there are lots of not hotel guests dining here. one of the reason why is that its situated next to a highway. i love the free parking! make a reservation before !! they are mostly full everyday!!
suitable for business stays or family events. nice restaurant and a cosy bar with nice finger foods.
"visited the place with some business partners for a quick catchup after a meeting. always good if this can be combined with some food.   the variety is good, so is the quality, service and accommodation."
"the kitchen really delivers first class food, and quite fast. we were a group of 20 people, and the waiting time was surprisingly short. the main dishes were excellent, but they did not even come close to the desserts. the sweet department was just heavenly. even after several days i can still remember the lovely taste of the cheese cake with caramell and icecream... :-)"
ate here while on business. i had the steak which was cooked perfectly. no complaints- exactly what i needed. im deducting a star however as i was charged an extra ‚Ç¨1 for the mayonnaise that i hadnt asked for. small i know- but very sneaky! would eat here again. 
"overall we found the food here very good. the restaurant is surprising large and despite its size we were quickly served. the food was generous, but also a good dining quality e.g. my large piece of meat came with a delicious stuffed vol-au-vent. the complimentary side portions of potatoes and vegetables was also generous and tasty."
you take a risk when you arrive without reservation. make a phone-call before. especially in the weeke 
"this is really one of the best van der valk restaurants. been here several times, always rather fast and good quality of food (no luxury, but for the money you pay its really good). interesting menu, products seem fresh and they even offer some organic dishes! the only thing you have to watch out, is where you sit, dont sit too close to the door as it usually smells like swimming pool there :)"
great variety of menu. quality is high and service too. the staff is very friendly and the wines are of good quality. the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and is very relaxed. good seating and pleasant surroundings.
what an amazing menu. there is everything that you could ask for or think of. service and quality is good. i bring any visiting family and friends here too. great birthday party packages too
"went here today with a friend of mine, real pancake love "
love tjis restaurant. great for family visits but also to treat my tourist friends when they are looking to eat proper pancakes.  but there is something for everyone and other meals can be served.  staff are friendly.  it can get busy so be prepared.
"ok i must admit i do not like pancakes...so it is really difficult for me judging this restaurant. the atmosphere is great, there is a little play area for kids and overall the good country decoration. there are many pancakes and they are really good."
nice restaurant with a little cheesy country/cowboy atmosphere.  the pancakes are very good and the wait staff attentive. you can get any combo of pancakes one desires.  the speck and kaas was very good  great place to take the kinders.
"nice staff (young) and always a coloring for the little kids, would you like a pancake with a childs face or a pancake with shawarma. plenty of choice and all pancakes are just as delicious"
nice place to have a dinner with family. this is my daughters favorate pan cake house in nederlands
situated pretty close to the highway a12 den haag and utrecht. lots of free parking places. walking to trainstation ypenburg 7 minut 
"once again here. nice food, nice staff, nice walk from delft. walk through a nice neighbourhood, along the water canals."
"we had a nice lunch at this restaurant. nothing fancy, but freshly made food, friendly service and - last but not least - you can bring your dog with you, and it will also get a warm welcome."
"enjoy the view, the sun, the beer, and the very, very good burger outside. if you are in the area, visit this beatiful spot. de vang has a nice staff and provide good lokal food in a very nice way. highly recommended on a sunny day."
"stopped today foe a hot chocolate and a latte, also a piece of apple cake and cream. the drinks were hot and the apple cake was excellent."
"we actually live about 200 metres from this restaurant. it has seen some changes over the year. lately, the menu has become a little bit more limited, but also a little bit more exclusive. no haute cuisine, but certainly a cut above your typical dutch eet-cafe type of place. it‚Äôs not chea "
everhthing is new and handmade fresh from own gardens and fresh herbs and spices. very fresh and good made food
"highly recommended! creative, tasty cuisine. the chef is talented. kind and excellent service!  it is worth spending lunch or dinner on the terrace when the weather is nice!"
we chanced upon this lovely restaurant while cycling in the area. the apple pie and corn bread is to die for and the staff were extremely helpful and kin 
what a super initiative from speksnijders and the lovely and helpful staff of their cafe en suit 
"onder de molen is a good place for special pancakes, served with a smile by a friendly crew. the pancakes are delicious, prices are very reasonable."
"as we were staying at de arendshoeve for my daughters wedding, we decided to have dinner at onder de molen which is on the same property and we were pleasantly surprised. the pancakes were delicious, the staff were friendly and we had a lovely get-together."
"good place to eat something, of course pancake are speciality but there are also other dishes available and desserts."
we visited in the afternoon for a drink and then in the evening for dinner. pancakes were delicious. we had the pancakes with the greek gyros and tzatziki. it was delicious and the meat was so tender. pudding saw us order a pancake with caramel sauce and an ice cream sundae. both went down well. i also liked the rose be 
"visited the pancake restaurant for a quick and easy evening  meal, good choice of both sweet and savory pancakes but drinks were a bit pricey. lovely location and good service. only downside was that they would only accept cash & not cards."
"very nice and tasty pancakes for a decent price. many variations available, including some specials. location under the mill is great and you can also visit the mill on request."
took our young grandchildren her for a friday lunchtime. service is by waiters from sheltered accommodation who do a good job. the pancakes are very filling and include a wide variety of sweet and savoury options.
"we wanted to try something local, so we went to this one for dinn "
we just stop by for pictures with the windmill but we had coffee and home made apple tart!! it was delicious. (friendly sta 
had our wedding reception there ...loved it...best pancakes in the world and wonderful people ...with big hearts ....lovely atmosphere
beautifully presented delicious food served by friendly knowledgeable helpers. the steak was as good as any i have eaten and that‚Äôs been a lot. the smoked salmon starter was served with a wasabi ice cream which was a new and a perfect compliment to the splendid fish. can‚Äôt recommend this eatery enough.
we came back to this restaurant following a specific request of our 16 years old daughter who enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. also this time the experience was nice and we had a good time. kind staff and nice ambience!
the restaurant is under new management and this draw a lot of customers: it was packed with people. however the service was still good: the staff paid attention to you. the food was great and tasteful. the portions are good.
"caught up with friends for dinner at hof21. sat on the roomy terrace. the food cooked by husband was delicious and the service by the wife was wonderful, very friendly. the atmosphere was lovely. highly recommended."
"this restaurant came as a very pleasant surprise, after a long day of client work in the local area and simply asking google what local eateries were open at 8pm on a sunday night. the waiters were extremely friendly, spoke fluent english, and helpfully translated the entire menu for me (although i was already convinced i wanted a steak with chips a soon as i walked through the door "
"the lunchroom is run by the krimpenerwaard day activity foundation, serving you with pleasure and a smile. nice tomato soup!"
we were staying at a b&b about 1 1/2 miles from lekkererk. we walked to the town in hopes of finding something to eat. we came across huisje van de zeeuw. as we were seated the waitress apologized that they did not have a menu in english only dutch. we told her it was ok and that we would figure it out with her help. they offered a 3 course meal with several selections in each course. everything we had was excellent and she provided great service. when it was time to pay i asked if they took a visa credit card and she did not know. so i opted to pay cash. a great place to get authentic dutch food and there were no tourists only locals in the restaurant.
"this past saturday we went for dinner along with couple who had highly recommended this place. it was a superb experience. the quality of the food, the ambiance and setting (we sat outdoors), were wonderful. most important, the service was excellent. the owners, a couple, took the time to check on us and our satisfaction. our server, sander, a young fellow, was on top of things and very attentive to our requests. thank you ett cafe de nar for the memories! even better when in the company of dear friends!"
"the food was excellent, fresh and sufficient. nice and friendly service plus the owner/cook informs about our satisfaction himself"
"staff very friendly , very good food , nice ambiance , highly recomended. we spend a few days in a hotel in the neighbourhood , the food was bad so we were lucky to find the nar."
a lovely old world dutch restaura 
"really good peolpe, good food and nice old ducht house. highly recomended, specially fish from the north sea. thanks!üòÅ"
"after a stroll we walked into the eet cafe and what a delight. full of locals, comfortable atmosphere, pleasant host and service. the food was excellent as was the beer. we left saying that was good local experience"
"arrived that day from canada. tired, needing food and rest. i had pork medallions she had steak. both were done to perfection and beautifully presented with a side plate of fries, baked potato wedges and salad. overall probably the best value meal during a week in nl. belgium and france. around $60 euro for two with drinks and tip."
very friendly service. meal of the day is always very good and of high quality at a reasonable price level. the restaurant as a very nice atmosphere and you feel like home.
excellent food in a friendly place.you can sit in the garden if you like. you should definitely eat here when you are in the neighberhood of lekkerkerk.
we came here on kingsday. the waiters were  really nice and the special menu was very delicious. thank you for this nice dinner.
we ate at the eetcafe de nar for 4 nights during our stay in lekkerkerk as the restaurant at the fletcher hotel restaurant de witte brug did not live up to its alleged reputati 
"i found this restaurant whilst looking into the village of lekkerkerk as we were staying at the local hotel , de witte brug, for a couple of nights. we did not book as intended to eat here on a thursday evening. when we arrived the restaurant was full, but the owner beckoned us in from the doorway and offered us drinks at the bar as a table would soon be free. we accepted and were extremely glad we did. the food was excellent. service was as laid back as you expect in holland and just how we like it! the owner was very hospitable, even showing us around his garden terrace at the rear of the property, used for outdoor dining in summer. would highly recommend eetcafe de nar if you are ever in the area, excellent food, not badly priced."
typical old dutch cafe... we loved the atmosphere! and i had the best  uitsmijter ever.  do not miss this one whenever in the neighborhood!!!
dont expect a 4* restaurant and you wont be disappointed. staff was friendly and ready for service. nice wine and good food. we had the pepper steak and pork tenderloin which were really good taste wise. the pepper steak was slightly too cold but when we let the staff know we got a nice compensation which we felt wasnt necessary. desert was also very nice. kletskoppen tart and coffee with treats. we enjoyed this evening very much and recommend this place when in the ijssel-lek area.
"the food is great, as well as the ambiance. also a very nice place for a birthday party or reception. nice to have a cosy restaurant nearby!"
"while this is not some french 3 star restaurant, it is a great restaurant for good food in a neat environment (at reasonable cost). it is in a smaller community slightly east of rotterdam. the drive to it can be along the dike road with the interesting scenery of that route. its location in a smaller community caused me to think that most of its business would be a relatively local clientele-------thus necessitating good food and serve. i was corre "
had a nice piece of fish cooked to perfection. the place was very warm and cozy on this cold winter evening. the waitress were very nice.

"i booked meiden van de molen for a private company event, ca 30 people. the owners linda, dick and fleur created an amazing evening for us - delicious food, great service, and a beautiful venue with great ambiance. the shared dining concept is really good, with interesting and diverse dishes all equally delicious. great value for money also - really not expensive for what it is. dick and linda were very friendly, communicative and accommodating and i am so glad i decided on their restaurant! cannot recommend it enough!"
"because of corona, we ordered a menu for dinner. it was really delicious, the foods well selected and innovative combined. i especially liked the dessert: yoghurt-gember-limoentaart met een dadel-notenbodem met limoenijs. if i could wish me a birthday cake, it would be that one!"
"surprising menu idea, it already was hard to imagine a preference for the christmas menu presented on the website. to our surprise, all dishes from the menu were served at the table. delicious dishes which formed a great combination. we all enjoyed the food and the evening. the dessert was also completely served, even with a musical surprise at the table. thank you for this wonderful christm "
top for the mid range food selections !! every time we are surprised by the quality of the self created listings !
"meiden van de molen means windmill girls. the windmill is cosy and has a cosy bar (nice bites!), separate upstairs for groups and restaurant. we had some drinks in the bar and were warm welcomed. staff is more than friendly and super attentive. only one look is sufficient to come to your tab "
"quite nice and cosy, with friendly staff and good meals. a good variety of food with matching wines. the bar is separated from the restaurant, making it very comfortable for both visiting groups. we will be coming back here."

"good food for a fair price. very friendly owner, waiters and waitresses, nice atmosphere in restaurant."
"la sirena has good pastas, pizzas and other little dishes. the restaurant isnt that big but youre not sitting on your neighbours lap. the staff is also friendly."
we have been coming here for many years  and are still very satisfied with the quality of the meals. they serve a wide variety of different authentic greek dishes. the service is very friendly. the restaurant is run by a greek family.
"nice restaurant for business- purposes, not a romantic one. very good service and typical greek-dishes."
"and very nice, friendly service and staff! food was excellent. we enjoyed the visit very much! price-quality was very good."
"we have been going there for several times now, and funnily enough we have always taken the same dishes. my friend is fan of moussaka which is absolutely lovely here, it is not swimming in fat, it is fluffy and delicious, and i am fan of gyros with tsaziki. every time we have been there it was always the same quality and the service is friendly and fa "
"i really, really love this plac "
one of my favorite indonesian restaurants in the netherland. authentic indonesian food for a nice price. :)
"this restaurant may small, but always bus "
real indonesian taste as it should be. i think pempek elysha should be ranked higher. we live in belgium but frequently visit the hague.... and pempek elysha. my personal favorit; iga kambing bakar
"we went for early dinner and this small restaurant was cramped. the tables were filled with mostly indonesian guests. that says something about the food. luckily there was still one table available for us. the ikan bakar (grilled fish), pempek adaan (fried fish cakes) and nasi goreng ikan asin (fried rice with salted fish) were exquisite! generous plates with authentic flavors. "
the best indonesian food ive had so far in netherlands!!!! well prepared and very good flavor. service was good too. reservation is required as usually packed. good parking spaces outside.
"hands down the only resto i would visit for authentic indonesian food! either you are indonesians abroard missing home cooking or someone looking to spice up your spice buds, come to this plac "
a small indonesian restaurant with authentic taste indonesian food. here you can enjoy a variety of indonesian typical dishes that you dont easily find in other indonesian restaurant in the netherlands. make sure you make a reservation because they have limited tables and let them know when you bring baby stroller so you get a table with easy acce 
"excellent food served in an atmosphere similar to a warung in indonesia. it would be even better, if the set menus would have more vegetables and less meat as options."
this catering/mini restaurant is one of my favorite indonesian food. i live nearby within a walking distance and so i either take home or just sit at a simple table (they have a few) and enjoy a warm delicious meal. there is not one dish i do not like. they make every day fresh dishes in the bustling kitchen at the back. i had once catered from them a whole buffet and the ladies came with their indonesian garments and served the guests. extremely friendly and clean. highly recommended. i believe they close at 19:00 or 20:00 hrs - check opening hours on their website.
here you can buy the best indonesian food in the netherlands. the staff loves to serve the customers and always gives me a little extra.
i always go there for indonesian food.... go there its a real gem. best place in the hague area for indonesian food. (winter can be cold;-) in the restaurant)
"we ordered an assortment of indonesian dishes for a birthday celebration. the food was delivered to our home in time, and was set up in our garden. compliments to the chef, the food was delicious!"
"i would recommend the take away service. the warung is simple and crowded, the good thing is the foof. delicious dishes for take away, supposed to be one of the best in the region."
"great take away, make sure you go before 5.30pm, after that it can get very busy. since being voted best indonesian take away in the netherlands, it has gotten much busier. anyway, they deserve the title, the food is very good. try the sate kambing. delicious! "
i am told by officienados that this is the best indonesian take out (with very limited and basic eat in) in the hague. i have used 3 local voorburg ones and it is the best of those but not the cheapest. there is usually a queue so that would seem to suggest that it is popular. 
it is one of the best tokos for indonesian food i know. great choices and very nice staff.  their are more than 50 choices.
excellent genuine indonesian food! good quality for a good price. they catered several time a party at our home. all our guests were very pleased and full of compliments to the chef. that is why they are the absolute nr 1!
according tot a yearly review of dutch indonesion food restaurants and take away (toko) toko menteng is the absolute nr1 for two years in a row.
we order very often at toko menteng. the service is very friendly & the food tastes wonderful! to cater a party can delight your evening  as wel!
"genuine indonesian food, freshly made with authentic ingredients: no wonder toko menteng is voted to be the best toko of the netherlands!"
"nice small toko with low prices under ‚Ç¨ 10,- and youll have taste explosion in your mouth. not really a restaurant."
"after reading the reviews, i decided to have  lunch.  the food was excellent many choices and the tempeh was also very good.  it is a small restaurant with some places to sit,  but perfect.  hope to be back soon"
well prepared and reasonably priced authentic delicious indonesian food. has to compete with popular toko nearby but withstands the competition well
good food and nice price nice location in village of voorburg...people vers nice and friendly. opening times good zeven days a week lunch also etc.
"an authentic indonesian toko. since i have indonesian ancestors, and i frequently cook indonesian food myself, and i went to visit indonesia for a month, i think i am a fairy good judge. toko menteng were ranked 3rd best in the country by a specialist website. the food is really excellent, very authentic, and affordable. eating at the toko is possible, they have 2 or 3 tables, but its more a take-away. a very, very good take-away! "
"we likes the indonishian takeaway. the restaurant had many customers (which we thought was a good sign), and we really liked the food. it was spicy and there was plen "
"the restaurant is part of shopping centre julianabaan. parking spaces are available. the setting is traditional for a chinese restaurant. unusual is that every customer can use the buffet for appetizers, dinners and dessert. the customer pays a standard tariff and extra for drinks. the food is quite good and is regularly updated. the dishes are the usual in a chinese restaurant, but taste quite good. prices are moderate. you can spend as much time as you like."
we chanced upon the r√∂se garden in an effort to find a good chinese place without the hassle of den haag parking. thankfully it was a sunday so there was not a lot of people. food was pretty amazing and all freshly prepared. definitely would like to go back aga 
"went there for a takeaway lunch for 6, and we had the best egg rolls ever, served with a delicious sauce."
booked a table in advance thou the place was not very busy when we walked in. had a nice table of six.the service was very good. food was perfect. nothing to complain about.enjoyed it and recommend to visit if youre in voorburg.
"rosa garden has been there for several decades and is one of my favorite restaurants in the the hague area. recently they reduced there price for the buffet, which the restaurant has during weekend and public holidays. the starterts at the buffet are great, with sushi, sharkvin soup, and dutch style salade. the main dishes are good, although i found it a bit to much meat orriented and missed spiced and stirr fried vegatables. the desserts are very good. the price qualtity is excellent. it is a bargain for what you get. highly recommended."
"i have three teenage sons and they love nothing more than a lunch at stuut with the traditional dutch menu, especially the uitsmijter. it is delicious and filling. the service is friendly here too and feels like an old fashioned milkbar."
"i came here frequently with me parents over a decade ago. recently i went here again, and they still got it.  staff was very friendly, the food was great and affordable, and the preparation time was great. great place for a quick snack :)"
"for a real treat of the the typical dutsch fast food, patates frites, meatbals and kroket, but also fast meals, go to stuut! near the central station of voorburg/"
if you like authentic dutch food stop here for a quick meal. the service is fast and the food is always good. i like to order a fried egg and ham sandwich and a coffee for breakfast before i board the train.
"excellent snackbar. great selection of the traditional dutch cuisine. excellent fries! very friendly staff, clean saloon, quick service and great snacks. plenty of parking available. go almost every week as it is close to my work. stuut is maybe the oldest snackbar in the region."
"typical old school snackbar and i recommend it highly if you are in for frites, a good  broodje warm vlees, hamburgers, kroketten or uitsmijters or just coffee and a sandwich. the frites are fresh cut and well-fried and all ingredients in all dishes are daily fresh. conveniently located near public transportation and with free hr parking."
"ive been here on a weekend day to have lunch. the food was great, i had a very tasty chicken and fries. the staff was also very friendly, i have nothing to complain about. it is located right next to voorburg station and you can park your car for free with a blue parking dis "
a very nice location on one of the old centre streets in voorburg. this lunchroom has a wide selection of tasty dishes. during the afternoon the sun hits you perfectly on their terrace. very friendly staff. good fresh food. defintately coming back here!
love the food here. i visited multiple times and i‚Äôm never disappointed. especially the goat cheese and avocado baguette is great. definitely recommend!
we visited ‚Äòaan de tafel‚Äô on a sunday afternoon when most eateries were closed. it was busy but with a good number of tables there was still room outside and inside the rstaurant. friendly service. someone offered help with the wifi. cappuccino was good and the club sandwiches were ok. i appreciated the salmon club variation was built with only a tiny bit of onion and well balanced in ingredients. overall it was ok.
"cozy atmosphere. nice staff. we had green tea, fresh, rootsliced, ginger tea and a doppio -double espresso- with water on the side. for lunch we had tomato soup, tonno venneto - and filet americain sandwiches served with rocket."
we had a french union soup and an ommelet with cheese and ham at this restaurant. it was very well prepared and very tasty. the service is very polite.  they have toys with which the children can play.
we had lunch hete totdat. we rally liked the menu with many good options. also nice fresh juices. a relaxed place for a good relaxed lunch!
"i have known this place for some time but never had breakfast. if you are staying somewhere in voorburg and want to have a great breakfast, go there. i mean, skip the hotel one because this is great. scrambled eggs, bread, ham, cheese and many other things. amazing and a lot to eat. know it for having a coffee, sandwich during the day and that is also great. relaxing place, no nonsense!"
"always friendly staff.  the aaan de tafel breakfast special is always delicious with plenty of ham, cheese and fresh brown bread."
the best meal we had in a long time.  best mussel pot i have ever had.   lovely relaxing atmosphere. we will definitely put this one at the top of our visit again list.
"we came here with a social deal. tucked away near the train station voorburg this is a small little restaurant, modern, contemporary, clean, quaint. it will fit about 50 people. we ordered a hamburger and entrec√¥te steak and had a latte and brownie for desse "
"if you live in the area and feel like eating out without too much fuss, this is your place. its under the train station, so trains literally pass above your head. but we liked that! we had a well done and a medium steak, both ok. the staff were polite but by no meas welcoming or friendly. just doing their job. however if you take the effort to go to the hague city center there are certainly better choices."
"dining at the village lounge is always a nice experience. the location is both good and bad: good because its near some office buildings and because when the weather is good, you can sit outside and enjoy a nice view. its also at the end of a nice shopping street. and there is plenty of free parking right outside the restaurant. bad because its underneath the railway station, which can be noisy. also the a12 motorway is running over the restaurant which makes it a bit dark. the service is excellent and so is the food at the village lounge. we had grilled tuna as a starter, and fish (my wife) ans pepper steak (me) as a main course. all very tasty, fresh, well prepared and good size portions. the petit grand dessert was also a treat and after a very good cup of coffee we left the restaurant and were very happy. oh and we also had a bottle of white wine and a glass of red with the steak. nice house wines at ok prices."
a great little cafe and lunch spot. the staff are very friendly and it appears that most clientele are regula 
"my parents use this cafe as their regular haunt and i have been a number of times myself. the food is always lovely, im partial to a club sandwich or surf & turf salad (divine). the service is always great too. its not just a lunch place though, you can pop in for coffee and cakes too!"
"we use toko eddo 6 to 10 times a year - plenty of variety, and with our firm favourite being chicken cashew - the full rijsttafel is available, as well choosing slightly different options - they delivery locally for free, and don‚Äôt charge too much for den haag addresses."
very tasty kip cashew! nobody should omit that one! nice personnel! good service also for take a way!
"the food is good and the staff are extremely helpful! when we asked about a particular dish they gave us samples to taste before we purchased! many of the dishes in the case are cold; however, they were more than willing to heat them up for us quickly. if you want some good carryout and don‚Äôt want to sit in a restaurant, this is a good place!"
we like to order the chicken cashew and gado gado and bali stew accompanied with nasi goreng or bami goreng.
"famous for their chicken cashew, eddo has been around in voorburg for a long time. but they dropped places significantly on the national best toko list. there are reasons for this, not in the least the growing stiff competition in town over the last few years. but eddo still offers good food. the service is somewhat chaotic sometimes (double check if you have everything before leaving with your take away) and they are expensive if you make the mistake of ordering all separate dishes instead of menus. but that last fact doesnt only apply to them. parking in front of the store is a problem. best to go on foot or bike if you live in the neighborhood. "
"excellent indonesian take away food. also possibility to eat there, more snackbar like then restaurant. very reasonable prices for fresh and tasteful food."
we go there a lot we love their indonesian food.kip cachou is one of our favorite.i really advise you to try.
"after renovation the place looks much better. it is always busy so a long waiting time....also the people who work there are not so quick. the chickencashew is what they are famous for! my dad cookes really great indonesian food, so i do not go there for food except the cashew.....i think the prices are a little high for take out.....but that is my opinion. the risolles i would not recommend them."
great indonesian takeaway. we have now ordered from here three times in the lockdown. it‚Äôs a really good delivery service. the food is delicious. we often order the rijsttafel set meal for vegetarians. it‚Äôs great. it compares really well to other indonesian food we have had. 
brilliant take away service. we had a second take away from here tonight. i am so impressed with this place. they phone to check an item that wasn‚Äôt available. and i‚Äôm sure they brought more than we ordere 
we go all the time. fresh food. generous portions. nice variety. very friendly staff. free parking. small eat-in area but we mostly carryout. convenient location with free parking and near bus and tram.
"had lunch here with a friend. we had a complete rice table. loved it! great quality food, enough to be completely full. very friendly personnel that gave great advice.  also pretty cheap in my opinion!"
"was looking for some good indonesian food in leidschendam-voorburg where in general the options for decent restaurants are limited at best and generally overpriced. since we had a visitor, we wanted to go for indonesian food. however, since we have young kids, we ended up going to a place to pick up food and bring home. most of the places weve tried are either too greasy or just overpriced. found this place through google search and it was not too far aw "
we live nearby and go here very often. other la cubanitas are not this good - which is probably why this restaurant is always full. food quality is super and cocktails are good. we love a good moscow mule. carpaccio and cuban stew are the best dishes but if you love seafood order shrimps. the spicy shrimp is delicio 
"went here tonight w 5 friends. the place was a buzz of activity. we ordered from menu while waiting to be seated. once seated - 10 minutes after arrival on a friday night - the plates appeared on our table. a huge assortment of tasty dishes and a very friendly wait staff. an evening full of fun, good food, and friendship! will definitely return next time visiting voorburg!"
"we visited on a busy saturday evening, i would recommend you book a table at the weekend as it was super busy and people were turned aw "
"went there with two work colleagues. the place has atmosphere and a buzz about it - not high end - but it does what it does very well. it is set up as a cuban tapas restaurant. it runs an all you can eat model for 17.5 euros plus drinks, the value is very good and the selection varied. a key part of the fun is trying the dishes - hot, cold, fish, meat, veg - all good. the staff were also very good. so in summary - good food, interesting experience and good service. i see some comments on the variance in the food - but this is part of the charm."
"ordered butter chicken for my wife and chicken vindaloo for myself, my favourite curry. asked if it could be made very spicy and i certainly was! however, i did miss some other indian spices to accompany the dish, so it did taste a bit monotonous. my wife loved here butter chicken. "
indian cuisine with a compact menu. husband in the kitchen and mom serving. willing to adapt the menu to you taste should you wish something made less of more spic 
"tucked away in a small shopping area, this place is great. looks like a takeaway from the outside but it‚Äôs a lovely restaurant. not posh but fabulous food and flavours. waitress helped us select food for kids too. well worth a visit!"
"hidden behind a supermarket in the midst of apartment blocks one can find this indian/nepalese restaurant. small in size, relative simple interior one can get an awesome indian food experience. we had a lovely tandoor chicken, very juicy. well marinated, grilled to perfection in the tandoor oven. in addition we had lamb tikka, samosa, onion nan bread, mixed vegetables with curry and basmati rice. all perfectly cooked. service is charming and prompt. perhaps not five star in interior but definitely in food. highly recommended. "
"great food, decent prices. free parking. tram stop across the street. could have more attentive service and serve tap water. little gem in mostly bland voorburg."
"thank you very much for the nice evening and the delicious pizza. super service and beautiful premises, the store is also excellent."
"da tano is named after the italian chef and owner, we very much enjoyed the fresh italian dishes, the nice atmosphere and the sunny terrace in the lively centre of sassenheim."
"this  is a very pleasant restaurant with a delicious lunch  menu.  the service is faultless and the ambiance  plesant specially on the terrace, which is adjacent to  small marina.  we wanted to be surprised and so we were in a most delightful way"
"lovely place for breakfast/lunch in sassenheim.  delicious salmon, wonderful coffee.  outside tables near the water.  helpful waitstaff.  clean and inviting.  loved it!"
brasserie hemels is set in the middle of sassenheim which is a lovely town and well worth explori 
"food is great. waitstaff is amazing; lots of patience and friendly demeanor. unfortunately there is no english menu, only dutch."
nice terrace with sunset. good service personnell the ice cream is nice with a lot of variaty and coffee tastes good. not suitable for dinner.
i generally dont really care for ice cream. but i make an exception for de zoete inval. all ice cream is freshly made and it is absolutely delicious. strawberry ice cream actually tastes like strawberries. they have an excellent collection of flavors and there are always a few unexpected surprises. and a nice bonus: its cheap! especially for what you get! 
"we went here on a saturday morning, not busy at all. the waitresses were very friendly and professional. the selection of cakes was fine, with different tastes - for example cheesecake and choc brownie. the coffee is served with a tiny ice cream on the side, which made this visit memorable. all in all a nice coffee shop, just of the main squire. happ to visit again"
this is a great new place specialized in own made ice cream and great coffee. the place is very popular in the summer and on a hot day be aware that some time in the queue is part of the experience.
"mochacino, icecream, cheesecake... all of them are surprisingly delicious. the service is polite. you can even drink hot schweppes lemon. :) really nice place for a breakfast."
"housemade icecream is the best in town (and wide environment). just delicious and wide variety + original tastes. best coffee in town as well, no doubt. good spot for lunch and high tea as well. value for money but not cheap and no reason for being cheap either. young and enthousiastic team but they do know what they are doing. all is just fine."
"its the best restaurant with greek food  i ever visited, nice fresh food, family/kids friendly and good place for events, birthday, parties and everything. the service is excellent they treat you with joy."
"nice place, excellent service, very very delicious food! the best greek restaurant in this town - highly recommended!"
"it was an excellent experience from this restaurant. family friendly, fast workers and clean place. i recommend you to visit it for experience greek vibes and greek cuisine."
that experience was very nice.the food was delicious.is the best greek food that i have tasted in the netherlands.the service was friendly and fast.i will visit it again for sure.  i definitely recommend it!
"the food quality, service and atmosphere are exceptional and a great value. we truly enjoyed our evening at this restaurant. highly recommended!!!"
"the place is great, great hospitality, the food was amazing!!one of the best greek restaurants i ever been in holland!!"
"the food was very tasty!the chef is really good.also,the atmosphere  was so friendly...thank you very much guys for this experience!!!"
"good food for a reasonable price. very friendly service. i liked most the zucchini burgers as appetizer, the lamb chops were also good."
"i was late from work on the way home. stopped at the highway restaurant in bodegraven. they had a discount meal of ‚Ç¨10,-. it was a small fresh salad at the saladbar, fries from belgium and a beef with butter. good meat. i only had to buy a drink"
after a bike ride we decided to stop here for dinner. we didnt have to wait long to order a bacon cheese burger and fries. the staff is friendly. what i also like is that you can sit in a busy part of the restaurant or more secluded. we will definitly visit again. the meal tasted fresh and delicious.
"we wanted to eat at a proper pancake house and this was recommended. four adults ordered and three of us were convinced we each had the best. pancake roma, kapsalon (shoarma, fries, cheese!), pancake with cheese and pineapple. the servings were huge. less happy was the shoarma special gent, but it was till very good - we did share!. the two kids had cheese sandwiches which were quite disappointing - a bit dry and firm. the children werent worried as the fries were good and there is a good playground where they played for an hour while we relaxed! was possibly a bit expensive by our standards, but who knows......"
we went eating with a couple of frien 
we have visited this restaurant in our last day in netherlands it is located in tge center of a very nice town. the food was very good also for the children. the waiter was very nice and helpful.
my first experience about this place was for v-day dinner with my gf.. second was with my gfs family. both had really great time in he 
"these people understand what its all about. we went out with friends and had a wonderful evening. nice atmosphere. good food. nice selection of nl tappas (small dishes) to choose from. brand beer and nice wines. price / quality in balance. staff was present and available but not pushing. just as it should be. anders - bodegraven, the place to be!! will we be back? no doubt."
"excellent place to go, nice crew and food! they also have good wines, and its located nearby the railway station. the restaurant is also attainable by boat, as it is situated along river oude rijn."
"i went to the restaurant with my girlfriend. we had a great spot outside. good thing is that in the evening, it is still sunny at most seats outsid "
"we live in the town bodegraven and we like this restaurant. overall the food is very good, although the menu hardly varies during the year and hasnt really changed since the restaurant opened 2,5 years ago. as we have two small children, we dont go out to dinner very often, this doesnt bother  "
traveling through europe the last couple of weeks this was the best food we have had. i had the duck and my friend had the chicken. absolutly delicious! the staff were friendly and proffesional.
people are very enthousiastic and loving their job. staff pays attention to details like setting tables with glove 
"‚Äò‚Äòthis comfortable- gezellig ( for you dutch patrons) resturaunt is situated on a lovely canal. the staff, very much, makes this a wonderful dinning experience. am i allowed to say ‚Äúnot all dutch restaurants & not all dutch servers‚Äù are service oriented. this restaurant seems to specialize in service! i was fortunate to eat here, two nights in a row, while they had their rare buffet nights. the chef is proud to describe his selections. they taste even better than they look. i have included pictures. they have an extensive dessert selection as well as 8 different after dinner coffee "
"you probably walk just by, since the restaurant is hidden away from the main road, but situated next to the small river oude rijn which splits the village of bodegraven in h "
"great spot on the market square. we stopped here for a coffee with cake in the morning. the cakes are mainly cream cakes from a local bakery, fresh and yummy. service was a bit slow and not very engaging, but fine. coffee tasted good"
"at the grand caf√© we discovered an utterly fantastic vintage-dated beer from wild yeast, the striffe hendrick. must be rare and small production as our attempts to later locate it at retail in amsterdam failed. but at least we had it, thanks to the great beer selection here and the recommendation of the friendly guys at the table next to us. great people-watching from outdoor tables!"
"missed the chance to try their pancakh as it is only serve before 17:00. but, i noticed there are lot of homemade food here. first time, we are little bit conservative and only ordered fried food. the taste is good. our dog seems enjoy being here because of nice food smellüòÑ"
"if you place a reservation 2 days in advance the chef will surprise you with an awesome vegan menu: all fresh, regional, saisonal and highly creative. one of our absolute favorites!"
"this restaurant doesnt gets lot of reviews,but,their rank is at number 3. i am very curious to know what would get. it turns out brilliant resultüëç. the restaurant prepared the free appetizer is special and delicious. we cant wait for the main course. now,i sort of understand why there are not too many people wrote comment, it can be either most customers are local or everyone enjoy the food and environment too much and nobody gets extract energy to do it "
this restaurant has an incredible chef. its great when you go to a restaurant and you have each time a culinary surprise.  having a menu where youre going  to get something new and exciting.
excellent food and atmosphere. nice and quiet surrounding with good and speedy service. the owner is the kitchen chef so that tells you he is destined for quality.
"its rare to find a korean restaurant nearby.the staffs are extremely friendly. the food is good, different from my experience in korea. however, its good anyway."
great koreaan restaurant from the outside you would not recognise this type of restaurant.but when you enter a warm welcome by the staff we were here with a group of people we ordered the menu whow what a flavours and structures.we will come back.
i absolutely love having dinner here. any excuse to get together with friends includes coming back to this restaurant. i normally gather a group of 6-10 friends and it becomes a fun dinner part 
"went there on a monday evening. the hostess gave us a very warm welcome and made us feel at home instantly. we decided to take two starters, the kimchi soup and the spring-roll (which actually consists of 2 spring-rolls). for our main course we had the spicy chicken and the regular chicken. to our surprise we first received a free appetizer: spicy fish in a fried filo pastry bag. due to the size of it, appetizer was not the correct term. the food was fantastic. perfectly seasoned and balanced in flavour. the portions of our main dish were big, in fact we asked for a doggy bag and enjoyed the rest the day after. when we were finished, we were offered a tiny drink on the house. meanwhile the restaurant was quite full of other guest "
visit this restaurant. very friendly people. is also hotel with rooms. menu is very nice with fish and meat. parking is close. also possibility to sit outside. for sure something to come back.
"dining two evenings in a row over here, superb is a good qualificati "
"for a real good and properly served dinner, you are at the right place.  better even, they use real freerange eggs and other real food.  service is, as already mentioned, high level and you will enjoy taking your friends and  family there."
"the menu is small, but everything is homemade and fresh. may be a little old fashioned but the food,drink and service is second to none . my friends and family eat here a couple of times a year."
"had lunch with husband here. a gorgeous free shrimp salad. a bit pricey, but delicious. my husband went for the traditional fried egg and ham plate.  v dry good"
no nonsense but best quality food. a special aperitive drink is the 4 years old bols corenwyn genever. goes fine with some seafood.
"located in a charming little village, i was pleasantly surprised to find such a good restaurant. very warm welcome, perfect service, quality and freshness of products. and all this for an affortable price. i shall return to this restaurant with pleasure."
"hotel with restaurant, both very high ranked. very nice place to eat, profesional staff. have eaten twice here. both times good quality, quite some fish and local dishes."
"we had lunch in loesjes again yesterday on our annual visit to oostburg to stock up with goodies from albert heijn. it was very, very busy but the staff did an excellent job in catering for everyo "
"we visit oostburg once or twice per annum as it has the closest albert heijn supermarket to the uk! sad i know but we do miss sate saus, sambal, varieties of dutch cheese and other goodies which we miss since we used to live in  "
"we were driving back from holland to calais and in need of a pit stop. after finding one small town completely shut up, we drove into oostburg, parked near the shopping precinct and found this nice litlle cafe a few yards away. our home made rolls were very tasty ( excellent bread) and service was good."
"great place to have one of their sandwiches, which are made right before you. also nice terrace where you can enjoy the shopping people. is also in the market area"
great lunchroom with a lot of flavoured pies and authentic cakes nice area with nice places to order your lovly lunch or a nice salad bread.we went for a coffee with a delicous pie with a zeeuwse bolus with custartd creme delicious never seen this before this local speciality.very helpfull and friendly personell great place to visit in oostburg
"excellent food, service, and atmosphere. prices are medium range and certainly justified by the very good quality food.  wey friendly staff. a very good place also for families with kids."
"on the way to zeebrugge, we randomly drove into oostburg for a leisurely stroll and lun "
"came for boerendag. grabbed a bite while i was there. got the fisherman. absolutely delicious! also loved the cole slaw that came with it and the jar it came in was a nice touch. great place to sit outside, overnight the square. great food. great time. "
"just went there to have a coffe, but it looks very nice, especialy on market day, sitting outside on the terrace in the sun, watching all that goes by."
we had a nice evening with very good food.  we like the atmosphere and the service was also very fine.
"friendly business, somewhere between a restaurant, caf√© and a traiteur. friendly folks are passionately running it and they prepare most of the racions/tapas/boccadillos themselves. their menu goes far beyond the standard palette of dishes that virtually every tapas restaurant in the world serves. i think this is the first time in my life that ive eaten *real* spanish/catalan food (not some kind of westernised 1-dimensional copy of it) outside spa "
"if you like to have original spanish food in a cosy restaurant, la cosina de espana is the place. no fastfood, but real taste."
"visited the historical city of ijsselstein. have been to this restaurant before and what a difference! the restaurant has been modernized, which has made it a lot more spaceous.   food was good, did not have to wait long. friendly staff."
this is an excellent restaurant with friendly sta 
every time i come for a meal at this awesome italian restaurant the service has never failed me. always friendly always eager to serve dont wait long for service or long for scrumptious italian meal. good going guys. really fantastic. will always come here for a meal. 
"excellent food, friendly environment, menu in dutch (as expected) but easy to translate with your google translate app! best dishes were the sliders! wings were delicious, and waiter was very helpful and provided excellent service."
lovely clean cafe / restaurant with a great atmosphere. indoor and outdoor dini 
"we had a dinner here. we arrived pretty late for the netherlands, but they kept open the kitchen for us. we had a meat and a satay; just simply but well done both. goode service, honest price: we will pass again"
"we went there for lunch and had a chicken club sandwich and a pork belly sandwich. the chicken sandwich came with fries. what can i say everything was well prepared, simple but with excellent taste combinations"
first of all let me start by saying the location is not the best but the venue makes up for that! the hospitality is fantastic and the way they treat the children is one of a kind!
lovely meal at a very affordable rate. food was wide ranging predominately of asian cuisine. all dishes ordered by our party were well presented and of high quality. service was very friendly. it would be recommended as the restaurant is small that table are reserved in advance. would definitely visit again.
excellent food. reserve as you may not find a place.. prices are reasonable. i recommend this restaurant if you looking to eat some good indian food.
the diner was fine and very friendly served. the restaurant is nice furnised. good place for a good asean meal
"it was a nice little restaurant, with just 10 tables i guess. the staff was nice and friendly. they explained everything and make a little chat with you. the food was really good, for a really good price. i will come back there."
la place is located just off the highway. we had their brunch special ($4.97) if ordered before 11:30am. you have a variety of things to choose from plus orange juice. i had coffee which was made to order and my wife had hot cocoa made by melting milk chocolate cubes with hot milk. both drinks were great. they also have fresh pastries that looked wonderful. everything is served buffet style. we are going back for dinner. when in the area make time for an enjoyable tasty stop. 
"the la place concept is simple dishes some pre-made, nicely presented, cooked by cheap staff. pizza, wok, grill go together and are pleasantly priced. the concept sees to it that meals are delivered at low cost. dont expect too much. this is the only eatery in this small village but there are better ones in maarn just a few kms to the west on a local road."
just the normal la place concept. good food for a good price. if you dont want to cook and just go out to get a fresh meal this is a good option at a good place near the highway. we choose always a meal with coupons and you can eat almost for 10 euros per person. 
ideal for a quick lunch or to work a bit. lovely terrace too. friendly staff. its self service and good quality. loved the xxl size fresh organge juice!
"loved the fact that the restaurant is using fresh ingredients for the dishes, i liked the deserts for the fact they didnt have tons of sugar in them like usual.  the meat wasnt the greatest, probably for the same reason. the pizza is wonderful."
"vast choice of wok, pasta, grill, pizza... etc. you choose what to take from wide selection and you meal is cooked while waiting. good food, fast service."
"if i dont have time to prepare food, this is a healthy alternative. easy access, right on the exit of the a 12 of maarsbergen. it is possible to eat in- and outside. i would rather go to la place then to a snackbar as it is nice, clean, healthy foods and a nice ambiance."
"the restaurant offers a buffet service. salad, soups, pizzas, sandwiches and cooked meals. good ice creams too. very child friendly. very close to the a12 motorway."
"had lunch here yesterday, and various times before, always good and fresh food available, friendly staff, and a nice terras to sit and eat outside!  will certainly visit again!"
"it is relatively fast food. you order and wait for the order to be prepared, tray in hand. depending on the plate you ordered and the waiting line, this can take 5-10 minutes up to 30 minutes when it is bu "
great place when youre have kids. lot of entertainment for them. the pancakes are good. not special or something like that. but a great spot to eat.
"relaxed atmosphere and great place for kids: there was a workshop table to decorate your own easter egg and the playground area where kids were enjoying themselves while parents could enjoy a great brunch, full of nice details. the staff were awesome, willing to help in english when we didnt understand dutch. good pancakes. a paradise for families in the heart of castellum!"
the battle of the pancakes houses around utrecht is fitter and this is one of the better ones. great facilities for kids and friendly staff make for an easy choice.
"i was here with my wife and we enjoyed the food sooo much! we both took three little dishes. i tasted all six and it was stunningly good!!! lamb chops amazing, steak tartare amazing, the fish was amazing... pfff what a great food! also the service was nice. only disappointing thing was they don‚Äôt have a wine card. with such great food i would invest in a nice selection of wines."
it was an amazing night. in my opinion the food was amazing. everyone found something to eat. my table was amazing there were ballons and  serviettes with 16 on it ü•≥üëåüèΩ
"amazing food!!! nice service but ong the food was so good! we ordered bread, mea, zalm and cheescake and we will come back!"
"top quality restaurant, either for lunch, dinner or take away: its always such a treat! lovely personeel in a beautiful atmosphere."
"first time diner at teus. courses were fine, it looks they are trying to go for a michelin star. i believe they need to put focus a bit more. to many tastes on the plate. the crew is friendly but paying not enough attention to the people. to many people in the restaurant, not enough people to ser "
"really enjoyed our business diner bij teus. wonderful concept, a homely atmosphere, a wonderful and original surprise dinner prepared in an open kitchen. also enjoyed the original wines. the restaurant offers half glasses so one can enjoy a pairing wine with all the courses. really recommend this restaurant but expect booking is essential!"
"straight forward high quality, well served, surprising food in an off-houten (generally middle of the road location) atmosphere and setting. feels more metropolitan than the suburban location sets expectations for. sexy interior, great food and very good choice of wines. a true culinary experience made practical and easy by the staff who engage in a small dialogue with you to advise and jointly agree on choice of food and wine. we had a great evening together and would certainly reccommend making a reservation here!"
conception great. you are filing like in home. waitress and wine expert like invisible bees doing their work. food is really tasty and portion is not so big. nice for relax and eat tasty food.
"our son who lives in houton took us to this fantastic restaurant. what an experience, no menu, the waiter just ask how many courses and if there is anything you dont eat. the waiter then brings you course after course of incredible food with a discription and a wine that compliments the food. expensive but as i wasnt paying i didnt see the bill. great food, fantastic service and not rushed, we went for 5 courses and it was a four hour night out. you ring the front doorbell and you are greeted as a friend that has been invited to dinner. in to the lounge for a drink and then into the restaurant for a great meal. i cant t recommend this place highly enough. well done bij teus."
"first you enter in a kind of living or a bar for a drink. when youre up to diner youll be seated to a nice table in a different setting. we chose a 4 course diner. all very good. taste and colour well presented. nice friendly staff, they all enjoyed it. we will come back for sure"
"this restaurant has it all. relaxing ex-industrial designer lounge interior, friendly and cheerful service, open kitchen, and not to forget: beautiful dishes. rather small portions, but rich in colours, tastes and flavours."
the welcome was friendly and cosy. the food was delicious and presented as a gift. i can advise you to go here for a delicious diner!
this is an excellent place. food is superb and the atmosphere is super relaxed. ive been here for 4 or 5 times now and its been great every single ti 
great restaurant in the centre of houten. its an old car shop and youll be seated around the large kitchen watching the activity. you can choose between 3 and 7 courses and for every course theres a matching wine recommended by very knowledgeable staff.
"very nice diner in a great looking reataurant. former garage, turned into a beautiful restaurant. we ate upstairs where it was very hot... (summer). you may want to make sure you eat outide or downstairs when its ho "
"formerly a gas station in the heart of houten, they have a concept: fusion, sophisticated food. you get to pick just the number of dishes, rest is a surprise. well done service, kind staff and...they even speak italian!"
"these guys have a concept. a former gas station was carefully redesigned into a lofty restaurant. giving the place an instant hipster ambience, exemplified by the waiting area for aperitifs, styled like a living room. the big green eggs dominate the kitchen, which is centered in the dining space, so you can see how your meal is prepared. there is a walk-in cellar where you can pick your own favorite wine to accompany original and delicious fo "
"dinner at teus is always a pleasure. a warm welcome awaits you at his front door, after which your first drink will be served in his cosy living room. after that you are invited to his surprisingly spacious restaurant where chef martin and his team serves the best food in town!"
"interesting concept. good ambience. good selection of wine. great food. friendly staff. however, we seemed to wait ages between courses. definitely not the place to go if youre very hungry."
bij teus is the restaurant in the village of houten with a unique approach. its like visiting your friend at home. the place is organized like a living room with casual easy-going service. the menu is extensive with superb usage of the big green egg. recommended!

very good foods served with originality.  high quality for both fish and meat. a step below the dessert.  nice also the location: informal and refined at the same time.
"the idea is to be at home at teus. this is the way we were received, first in the living room.  and then in the kitchen. see how the food is prepared. nice view. and the food: excellent. tastefull. go and experience!!!"
"second time ive eaten here. both times have been corporate meals with a minimum of 9 people. as others stated not what you expect from the outside but once inside a great atmosphere and an experience with course and wines able to be matched, courses are in line with a fine dining taster experience, each course explained by your serv "
in this restaurant you feel like you are sitting in the kitchen and that you are part of the kitchen. the restaurant is in a very special building (an old garage). the restaurant has a huge open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant. the reception is in an actual livingroom where you can have a drink. then the ambiance changes when you go to the actual restaurant. the menu is great and they like to surprise you with dishes. we did this and it was amazing. combined with a very nice wine selection. the price is good.
"knowledge about the wine is poor, but good enough for a good fit with the excellent food. enough vegetables! very friendly service and not too present!"
"first thing is that is really easy to miss. it looks just like a house, any other dutch house with big windows. but it is a restaurant. first youre welcome at the living room, get a drink and have some time there. once youre finish with your drink, you are transferred to the dinning are "
"despite the title of my review, i had a great evening at the restaurant. we were welcomed by our host who provided us with a small glass of roasted onion soup (very good). it took a while before we were seated. the food and the service was great. eventough we had a set menu, there was enough choice for people who either did not like one of the options or just wanted something else. i was told the wine was great, but since i was driving had not the opportunity to try it myself. after 3.5 hours i left the restaurant content and with plans to come back with my family."
"i rarely post remarks of my trip, however, i have to do it because this restaurant is a very very good one. at the begining, i was a little bit lost as a foreigner. the entrance looks like somebodys small cosy house entrance, then you hesitate to push the ring button and you are questionning yourself is it that place ? finally i saw a couple of people rung on the door and a waiter (maybe the owner) opened the door and welcomed us warm "
"people that want a change from the ordinary, will be pleased by going to bij teus in houten nl. a new concept restaurant with the kitchen as centre. innovative dishes in a surrounding different from the usual. the front facade is almost antique, but once inside the change into modern architecture is impressive. a lounge area in the front part, with the restaurant in the back, that formerly as a garage workshop served. impressive is the huge pencil drawing on the wall expressing a roman era bathing facility. which actually this site in the ancient days has been. the food quality is good and the service correct although a bit slow. well-recommended."
this is a nice relax restaurant which serves local products. its a nice place to go out if you are in the area of houten but i wouldnt go out of my way to go here.
"going on an afternoon or early night for a drink we always and up with annelies, the owner of the zwijger. relaxed , comfortable and cosy, we feel at home here. being welcomed with your favourable drink, some peanuts and a smile, thats where you go for if you go for the zwijger. off course there is the good food but you go mainly for the atmosphere."
"a nice local pub in the heart of the old village, that serves an extensive range of (local) beers. when in the pub you should definitely try the local beers of the hommeles brewery. their range contains some interesting bee "
ive been here a few times for coffee. the staff is friendly. there is a good choice of teas and coffees and delicious cakes.
hands down the best coffee in houten. they also do a man carrot cake!  what more do you need from cafe. recommended for all coffee lovers.
great staff and an excellent selection of coffee and something sweet to eat. all their cakes are freshly baked.
"really nice place to be.. drink a delicious coffee, eat some home made bread and enjoy the good vibes around you :)!! and nice staff.."
i travel for work to and from different locations in the netherlands. joinn ha been a perfect choi 
stayed there two times already on a long term (9 months) st 
"this venture is very central located. i come here often to do business. the coffee is delicious! and of course their famous cheesecake, unbelievelably good. also the restaurant is really nice. fair prices for really tasty food. they use a lot of food / ingredients which are provided by local farmers and entepreneurs."
"i had a fantastic time while having lunch, kings day party, drinks or attending the crazy piano show. the staff is excellent! moreover, i stayed for 7 months in their studio apartment. i requested to stay in the same apartment that was showed to me, 307. i really loved the place. it has everything you need for a temporary stay and it gives this warm and cosy feeling like being home. not to mention the location is so excellent: close to supermarkets, the grand caf√©, dry cleaner, tailor, photographer in case you need to prepare for a visa application. and makes it easy to travel to the rest of the cities in netherlands. i left the place with 27 boxes and you will wonder where they all fit in the apartment?! it is because of the really well designed and thought through elements that makes it so convenient and easy accessible for instance cooking without feeling overcrowded. the storage is great without making the place look messy. and being a woman you can imagine the amount of things one requires on daily basis! :) i liked the fact that i had sunshine coming in, the balcony access and both doors opening, the window shades for a great dark room so needed for a good night sleep. enough number of plugs and well positioned. just perfect! i recommend it for anybody that wants to start a life in netherlands. it really offers the ground base of stability needed. i just know if i ever decide to move back to netherlands, ill start at joinn!"
temporary accommodation for 7 months. in between house moves. would recommend xl loft for long stay. very comfortable. staff very friendly and great atmosphere. for business or pleasure great location.  food and service excellent in cafe/restaurant on site. free parking
"limited but good choice of dishes, also vegetarian. food and drinks at mid-range prices but well served. good coffee too."
"although there is a restaurant on site, they have short term or long term lofts above the restaurant. we stayed in a 3rd floor loft. like a bachelor apartment. modern decor exactly like the photos on their website. mini fridge, dishwasher, cooktop with a fully equipped kitchen. shopping & grocery stores within a block. located directly across from the houten train station. we did not need to rent a car. biked everywhere. safe & secure as you need door card to use elevator up. we ate a few times in the restaurant. nice to sit outside."
"a few times a year we hang out with friends to drink something in the evening. instead of going to the same place every time, we decided to not go to de zwijger, but to joinn instead. its a very small bar place, where you can also have lunch breakfast and diner. service was good, drinks were nice and the even made cocktails we requested and were not on the menu. the only down side is the size of the place, its very small. keep that in mind when going there without a reservation. so, when its not too crowded we would sure visit again some time. "
"when we want to celebrate my wife and i usually seek out out a greek restaurant. parthenon is one of our favourites. the atmosphere is always very welcoming and the menu offers a great variety of dishes, both traditional greek and more popular mixed grill dishes."
a nice restaurant with an attractive menu. warm atmosphere. food is very good and service attentive by nice staff. fair prices. also a great place for a warm winter drink after spending time outside.
well-known place. used to be a village type of hotel + restaurant but the new team of owners have succeeded in transforming the restaurant into a modern place but with classic touch and warm pallet of colours.
"many positive points for this restaurant. easy to reach, being located at a thoroughfare, a large free parking area in front of the restaurant, inside is the restaurant light and spacious and the service is friendly and homely. this good service may justly be emphasized, because good service in certainly not standard in dutch restaurants. however, about the food, there is room for improvement. portions are small and the food is maybe a bit bland. generally, the bill in dutch restaurants have been elevated from the usual very high to the level of eye-watering due to the round of inflation in the netherlands and bergzicht is no exception. however, weighing the pros and cons i really can recommend bergzicht for a stop over, just scraping home with a narrow four points rating."
"this is such a cute place, the staff is friendly and the food is great! your mouth can start watering from the moment you sit down :-) the prices are also very reasonable. i recommend this for any pancake lover!"
second time we have been here. it was very busy this time.  staff were unflustered despite a busy evening. we were seated. served in good time. food was good. good range of pancakes and fillings. we hope to come back again when at henschotermeer.
"very friendly staff, nice location, even ok to sit outside while a bit chilly. very busy of course, but they managed to seat us. for larger groups; book in advance!"
we have eaten here regularly and keep coming back. the service is good and correct. the food is fine. they have two other locations where we have come. also there it was fine.
"set in a beautiful forest, this friendly place serves right up to expectations. kids love it. dont go here if youre looking for anything stylish and quiet :-)"
"very scenic location, close to pyramide van austerlitz, excellent ambiance, very pleasant and friendly staff. good variety of pan cakes and omelets, very good coffee. overall must visit place if you are in this region."
"had a nice lunch with a group of friends before heading onwards to amersfoort. all pannenkoeken tried were delicious and prices seemed quite reasonable! service was helpful and friendly but not everyone could speak english but we were offered english-language menus. restaurant itself is on a highway between doorn and amersfoort and is quite spacious. i would like to rate it more of a good than very good and it certainly was more than average. when it came time to pay or it was clear we were done, the service was tad slow but otherwise it was nice lunch stop to eat some typical dutch food and i have logged several visits to the netherlands"
had a light lunch at this restaurant around the corn 
very beautiful surroundings as well as interior. kind service with a smile. good coffee and ‚Äúappeltaart‚Äù. super cozy experience overall.
"you can choose five dishes at a time, five times over. we were ravenous, but only managed two rounds of some wonderful dishes. we enjoyed the dutch take on oriental food, as a welcome change from what we usually get in the uk. our waiter was charming, helpful and chatty (but not too much) and the bill, including drinks, of ‚Ç¨50 was good value for excellent food and very fast service."
"all-you-can-eat-concept is a challange if you want to use the card to its full extend. i wish you good luck. and then you can still take dessert. everything was very tastfull, portions were big enough and there was a huge variety of choise."
"weve been here several times, and the staff is always friendly, there is a great menu (all you can eat sushi for only 24 euros). the sushi itself is not that great but the grilled dishes are (such as lamb chops, peking duck, et "
"this is one of the new sushi all you can eat restaurants in the netherlands. originally a chinese restaurant, now converted into a japanese restauran "
chalet helenaheuvel is located in the woods of doorn. the chalet is excellent for a drink or lunch after your walk. very busy during sunny weekend days!
great place for a relaxing coffee and cake during a forest walk. the view from the balcony is magnificent
"what a lovely view your have from the restaurant and terrace here! it is a lively place for walkers, but can also be accessed by car."
"the pancakes are a must eat, i am dutch living in the usa but this location is not to be missed. enjoy the journey getting there. climb the nearby tower de kaap and you will have a great 360 degree view of the area. try the local beers on tap, you can walk for a while in s beautiful park"
"we stopped for a late lunch so the choice was a little restricted. saying that from a full menu i would still have chosen the colour palette*. freshly prepared with great ingredients, it was a welcome change to the normal dutch menu. a little pricey but you get what you pay for he "
"brilliant fresh juices; oranje boven. great sandwiches with fresh, high quality toppings. bread is very nice as well.  service is very friendly and attentive in this small place. terrace in the sun, provided the sun shines."
froukje is a hole in the wall coffee shop with a personal touch and warm cozy feel. the hosts are always very friendly and personable. in my opinion the coffee is up there with the best in the world.
just a bit of sunshine is sufficient to enjoy frouckes nice (heated) terrace. she serves genuine natural food.
ive been to froukes a few times and it never disappoints. she serves excellent coffee and it is a charming pla 
"what a lovely place to get some coffee and sandwich. i had the cappuccino with some soy milk and hummus, avocado, aragula sandwich and it was delicious. stylish little place with a great service! id definitely go back."
"friendly service and great coffee! and the treats are irresistible üòã the only place in town where you can get a scrumptious soy latte and a gluten free banana cake, yum!"
"everything fresh with very good coffee, actually the best coffeee in the area as it is properly made. the lunches are very tasty with fresh ingredients. can sometimes be busy as it is not big."
"we visited this place early in the evening, and the waitress kindly helped us heating up the pre cooked meal for our toddler. the tables were wide apart but still our kid could enjoy the kids playground. the food (pasta ravioli dish and chicken sateh) were lovely. also they took care of the covid measures: there were hand sanitizers, and visits to small toilet spaces were restricted/organised by a cap, there was additional terrace space outside, meals were served with distancing) "
"we moved to the netherlands from belgium and have been going here a couple times a week all through summer. the ice cream is great especially lemon pie, pistachio and coffee (although i wouldnt combine those). scoop size is heavily dependent on the employee (and they seem to have a lot of different ones). overall, highly recommend."
we went there after a business meeting and we really enjoyed the very dutch informal atmoshere and the great food.
we came here as the restaurant beside the hotel was fu 
this is nog a regular pancake restaurant. you can also chose different menu‚Äôs which is nice in you nog fancy pancakes... 
we took a bit of a detour to just enjoy the environment and stumbled upon this pancake place. it was quiet inside but the interior looked very nice and it smelled good t 
"this is a great place to eat great pancakes. i had a savory pancake with bacon, pine nuts, goats cheese, sun dried tomatoes etc. what a feast. my sister had a sweet pancake - lots of stroop applied. our dutch friends also had savoury pancakes. a large restaurant with outside eating places for those who wished to dine outside. the staff were very helpful offering an english menu to help with our translation from the dutch menu card. we had delicious ice cream to follow. all in all well worth a visit. keep up the good work!"
"i have been at this pancake restaurant 3 times during the last 6 months. 2 times with family and 1 time with customers. we all really enjoyed the food. one time it was clear that there is a farm nearby the restaurant, but it is not disturbing in my opinion. loved the pancakes and will certainly come back again."
"this is a place with a range of wonderful produce, much of it of local origin. the staff are very helpful and welcoming. the location is great, on the edge of the countryside. its really worth a visit!"
"if yo uare looking for somewhere to have lunch in veenendaal, then look no further than lef! with the demise of v&d, there has been a huge gap left in the lunch market and sadly there is not much choice in the centre. but, now we have lef! fresh food, locally sourced, prepared in the open kitchen so you can watch your food being prepared. smoothies for every palate. and also for children who have there own area in which to play. so, next time you are hungry in veenendaal, walk past mcdonalds and go to the place one door down and you will be most pleasantly surprised."
"this pancake restaurant has a varied menu, of course all kind of pancakes but also other food. both inside and outside there is plenty of space for the kids to play. i recommend this place for familiedinners, etc."
"on a nice sunny springday we went to this restaurant with one of the grandchildren. the restaurant is sacious, very wel equipped inside and outside for young children. a playground outside is one of the attractions while the (grand)parents have a great view on their kids. the pancakes are well cooked and tasty, the ambiance very pleasnat in a lush green surrounding and the service is okay. recommended, especially with young kids."
"a very busy evening it was, dozens of eaters in. waitresses were doing a great job. food okay, a bit bland though. they charge for tap water in refilled bottles."
"this tapas-restaurant is different from the regular tapas-restaurants. lots of space, nice personnel, good tasting food. but... to make a reservation at this restaurant it looks like you have to try that almost two months in advance!  worth a try :-)"
"the food in this restaurant is very tasty and good quality indian. the mixed platter for starters comes with 5 variously pieces of meat, all spiced differently and all very good. the lamb madras was delicious but spicier than expected ( even though it only had 1 üî• indicator "
"nicely decorated, spacious indian place. very friendly and helpful staff. opened 7 days a week. our first visi. we had a mixed platter, just to get to know the kitchen. curry‚Äôs and chicken were very good. deserts - not spectaculair - but certainly a place to explore. "
"my family and i grabbed a table here for dinner staff was extremely friendly. the food was rather good as well. we ordered dishes we wouldn‚Äôt normally, and although i like dishes more spicy, they were lovely to eat. would recommend."
"we booked namastey last moment fancying indian dinner which we did not have long time.  great welcome, nice restaurant, slightly noisy in the beginning.  the staff was extremely friendly, the food we liked and very well explained by the staff.  good experience."
second visit. we decided to go there without reservation. no problem. again good food. really worth trying to go and explore the indian kitchen
"the restaurant is only opened recently. we know the indian kitchen a little, so we have been waiting to try this restaurant "
first time visit but wont be our last. two dishes on one plate. eat with your utensils given to you at birth. very tasty food very friendly people serving.. a must go to restaurant
"friends of ours invited us for dinner at this restaurant, which serves african food. well, the food is spot-on, especially considering the very reasonable price. the only possible downside is the fact that you are supposed to share the food and use your fingers rather than a knife and fork."
"we have eaten there once now. african food is a very welcome surprise. the tastes are so different of what you are used fro in mostly french and asian kitchens.  staff is friendly, good service"
so good that eating out is possible again. we really enjoyed a generous pork filet and a most tasty pizza.
"walked past this place many times but only visited first time this week with family. we all went for pizza and they were amazing - just right, crispy thin crust not too much tomato sauce . we got some nice warm bread to start with for free, which was a real nice gesture. pizzas are big so i didn‚Äôt have space for dessert but some in our party did and they liked them a lot. service was also very good "
"a very nice and comfortable restaurant with the allure of a grand caf√©. a wide and delicious variety of well thought of food. friendly staff. we also had a party in the basement afterwards, which was great too."
"visited buena vista for a quick dinner on a monday. everything was great, and the portions were really big. we ordered a starter of nachos but this wasnt really necessary. good price and quality combination with friendly people."
"amazing! there are no other words that can describe this restaurant.  the food was fantastic, awesome staff and such a nice environment! and also the bar-man was so extremely nice and funny and made our visit memorable!  this restaurant is a have to!"
"we had dinner with 7. ordered the tapas-combo. nachos, soup, a selection of cold tapas, a selection of warm tapas, dessert and finally coffee/tea. we all had more than enough. it all tasted fine and looked ni "
"my husband and i have been living in rijssen (a little city in the east of the netherlands) for just over 4 months now. we have been looking for a nice restaurant to go to whenever we have something to celebrate or to treat ourselves. this past weekend we tried buena vista and wow! what a lovely discovery!! we walked in to find a restaurant nearly packed to the brim but the waiting staff found us a table and promptly brought us there. we had a look at their menus and they have a really wide variety of dishes and drinks. we ordered drinks and a tapas to start with. despite it taking a bit long to arrive, it was delicious (we had chicken bites with honey mustard sauce)! we decided then and there that well be back to have only tapas. we both ordered a pork dish as a main and we had it infront of us in no time! it was absolutely lovely. it had enough sauce, wasnt dry at all, it had some veggies on the plate and there was a side order of fries and salad. after all that delicious food, we decided to have dessert. my husband had tiramisu and i had creme brulee with ice cream. i didnt want the ice cream as mentioned on the menu and it was no problem at all to have it substituted by a different flavour. the creme brulee was bit of a let-down but i thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream. all in all it was a wonderful dinner and night out. they service was good and the atmosphere very relaxed. one little negative was that the music was a little too loud which prompted everyone to speak louder and the lights were too dim (my husband couldnt read the small print on the menu). buena vista also has a party hall which is directly adjacent to the restaurant but this was no problem as we never heard any loud noises or rowdy behavior. i would definitely visit this restaurant again but think that next time well reserve a table to avoid disappointment (i consider us lucky that we got a table so quickly this time)."
the atmosphere was relaxed and the service friendly and prompt. the menu choice was ok and the prices reasonable.  one disappointment was the quality of the fried potatoes - greasy and not crispy.  i would also advise management to include oat milk on the menu.
a very tasty sandwich and iced tea on the terrace. perfect lunch on a sunny afternoon. a lovely waitress helped us with the menu as like most brits we speak virtually no dutch.
"sat down for a coffee and something sweet. the terrace at the front is accessible to strollers (which we had). the bigger terrace in the back was also accessible to strollers, but you had to walk to the back and someone had to open the gate for you. that was too much hassle for me on that warm day. coffee was ok. had a crepe with nutella and ice cream, that was ok as well. it did not impress me. however it‚Äôs a great looking place/building and the staff was very friendly. "
my family and i ate here and absolutely loved the food. it is a really nice place to be and the staff were really friendly and attentive. if i lived in the area i would come here often.
"my family and i had the set menu this evening and cant stop talking about the creativity, presentation and quality. the staff are professional and very friendly. great place! best restaurant weve been to in holland so far, by far. loads of charm too."
i went here last july with my family and enjoyed the warm and friendly service. the food was delicious.
nice place. the staff is very helpful. due to some staff with a handicap things may take a little longer. but is it very good to see these young people do there utmost best to serve the customers. well done all of you. enough choice on the menu. food was good.
"we visited on a weekday evening for dinner. this restaurant is run by people with a slight handicap, aided by professional wait staff. we received a warm welcome and were free to choose a tabl "
staff was friendly and very attentive. food was good and reasonably priced. they have indoor seating with big sliding windows that can open up. the waffle with fresh strawberries and ice was delicious. definitely a good option for dinner!!
"went there for a bowling session with dinner afterwards. anything was done exactly as wished for by the organizers. sometimes the waiters could be a bit more sensitive on empty glasses but all in all.. no complaints. the food was nice, the bowling was nice and all of us enjoyed for a very acceptable price."
"nice terrace, good service, excellent coffee. must get very busy in the season, there was already a good buzz on a cloudy weekday"
"interesting offering: main dish is live cooking (choice of 15 or more meat, fish, seafood and even exotics like ozzie and african beasts and frog legs). sides, soups and salads are all you can eat buffet and dessert is one size fits all. our experience: excellent tastes and varieties, except maybe some choice for desserts would have been better. one of our party however was vegetarian and this should have been prebooked, a good lesson learned. they improvised very well but due to this there was a risk of miscommunications somewhere between kitchen, waiters and guest ‚Äì guest got soup, entree-almost-as-big-as-mains and after that a delicious ravioli as the real main dish! imagine the monthy python sketch about the last after eight, but worth a good laugh‚Ä¶"
a decent restaurant with decent products. dont expect the highest qualities but just good tasting and nice food. the fresh preparation of the meat and fish is good.  the service is exceptional good.
"large selection of dishes, friendly chatty staff. good place to spend a relaxed evening and a full belly!"
"my wife & i had diner in this take away, fast food restaurant that has about 18 covers at table close to the serving counter/cooking area. it has a varied choice of italian and dutch food so there is a lot to read and choose from. my wife choose lamb cutlets and five generous chops were served with salad, 3 sauces and a generous portion of saut√©ed potatoes. i had a rib eye steak with mushroom sauce, saut√©ed pots and salad. good sized portions and well cooked. fine for a hungry couple but ambiance is not for a romantic night out."
"the people are very friendly. the atmosphere is pleasant. the food is excellent. i recommend that you share a portion. the calzone fantasia or the calzone shoarma are very good indeed and more than enough for two people. the choice of beer is ok, but do not ask for an alcohol free beer. there is non "
"good food good prices,friendly service,very helpful the menu in english,,it was clean,we order a hawaiian pizza"
"very pleasant pizza cafe in zwanenburg. excellent friendly service menu also includes english translation. we ordered the soup of the day (onion soup), pizza (no 29) and the house red wine. they brought out some olives, and warm bread, yum. good food, wine and company and enjoyed the passing views. "
good food and reasonably priced.  the service is excellent and there is a decent variety in the menu.
"its in the middle of nowhere, so we didnt have a lot of options, but it was a good experience. the waitress was super friendly, a sweet mother. olives and bread were served beforehand, nice. the pizza was fast and good."
"good food and very friendly and professional personal so if we visit the place  we will eat in the great restaurant normal (relative low) prices for very good diner, also breakfast is fine"
"great location, easy to access with plenty of parki "
"this looks like a really nice place in better weather as the outside patio looked quite enticing. this was an informal business dinner. service was pretty good, couldnt find our server to pay our bill. service was pretty good, couldnt find our server to pay our bill. i had bouillabaisse for the first time. my french colleagues said it was served properly. i enjoyed the mild flavors of the broth. the other two said their dinner was quite enjoyable. this also served as breakfast for the hotel and i found the breakfast buffet extensive and well worth the $11.50 if you like a large breakfast."
usually a perfect place to have a dinner. have experienced this several times before. service and food absolutely grea 
a delicious bagel breakfast and great service. will definitely return when in the shopping centre again and will recommend to others.
stopped here on impulse during a shopping visit to the middenwaard shopping center. the peking duck was a win!
"if you are looking for a real taste of chinese food especially baking duck, here you are. very authentic taste both food and atmosphere. friendly staff and choices of drink. order and take away is also available. try this restaurant and you will definitely love a chinese food."
everything from the get go was a good experience. they had an english menu and rhe waiters where more than eager to help and explain the dishes. if youre not careful you will end up full before your main course so mind the starters....
as a greek living to the netherlands have tried many greek restaurants around. this one has one of the best quality and quantity. gyros which is a traditional meat plate was really good and feta saganaki even better! you have to try it!
"if you are looking for a restaurant, that serves good food and at a great price quality ratio, this is the place. donot expect haute cuisine, but for a pleasant night out befor going to a movie or theater, this is it. staf is young and friendly and is helpfull."
it was the 4th time we went here. servie depends on whos coming to youre table. one is friendly others are sometimes to really good in pushing for drinks. a bit annoying. asking for drinks is ok but not 2 times in a minute.
"de kolonist has put the first steps to fine dining on the map in heerhugowaard. for many years it was hard to find a good restaurant, and there was definitely not enough choice. in recent years this has changed, and de kolonist is definitely in the top 3 of best restaurants he "
good atmosphere. always busy even on a monday so for groups make reservations. bistro card with diverse choice. make sure you ask for vegies when you order a dish..
"i have been here a lot of times and it still is one of my favorite restaurants in the region north holland. the price / quality in this restaurant is good and you can have a tasteful dish for a reasonable price. parking places are in front of the restaurant and near it. the staff is friendly and well mannered. the chefs are open to any special requests on food and with their open kitchen you can take a look at the preparation. i like the atmosphere very much here. for the children there is also a little cinema where they can sit and watch a movie. families are most welcome here! also as a couple you can have a romantic diner. so now and then they have a selection of dishes that are specially priced, that makes it even cheaper to go out and eat a diner. if you are in the neighborhood please stop by this restaurant for lunch or diner. it is worth a try."
the food and the service was excellent. the cook even allowed me to borrow a blanket as we were finished as it started to rain.
"first impressions very positive. cozy and nicely decorated. friendly staff, prompt service. catch of the day was dorado, fresh and simple. beef tenderloin was served on skewers, correctly cooked to temp requested. fries were tasty. the vegetables served as side dish were a bit lackluster, but no other complaints. good value for money."
"we were here for dinner. its a cozy and good restaurant, with very nice and friendly staff. food is very good. wine is also very welltasting. service is great. i would recommand this restaurant to everybody."
"had a great lunch with friends at fleurie. good catching up! the service was very friendly and effective. a nice table was reserved for us. the lunch sandwiches were very tasty and amply decorated with lettuce. the amount was ok, perhaps a bit on the small size. prices very moderate."
"we really enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant. great service - friendly, enticing and efficient - and the food was delicious. we would highly recommend"
"fleurie is quite a pleasant slightly alternative eatery in the main shopping drag of posh bloemendaal. they have a great streetside terrace. around lunchtime it gets busy with representatives of old and new money, mostly ladies of a certain age, gathering for a hearty bite. the food is good though somewhat pricey and the service is friendly, but at a moderate pace. overall a good place to make a stop and enjoy life."
"fleurie is a lovely restaurant in bloemendaal with a wonderful terrace. the food is freshly prepared. i had the salad with goat cheese and the beet soup, served with bread and butter. wonderful gluten free deserts. i had hartendief. they serve coffee and tea. i had the fresh mint tea with ginger. service is friendly. i really love this place!"
"fleurie is an extremely nice restaurant. i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, nice wines, friendly service and athmosphere. the french chicken was delicious! we had a lovely evening and definitely recommend it."
"they have a great vibe, great food and lovely service. the food is fresh , varied, there is indoor and outdoor seating. we stopped for lunch. it‚Äôs just really good. the decor is appealing too, it‚Äôs cool and hip. village fave and if you‚Äôre passing through a great place to go from as simple as a coffee to a tasty dinner. "
"its at the end of the main street and there is a a little parking terrain. the food last time was delicious and well made. the place is lovely, nice indoor/outdoor seating, easy to wile the time away. this time we just sat for drinks, and its perfect. classy place in a nice little town with good food, drinks and good service."
"delicious fresh made lunch. presenration of the dishes is perfect. sevice is great, friendly. we loved the dessert: vanille icecream, coffie and chocolate."
"i heard good comments about the place, food was delicious & beautifully served with eatable flowers. service also attentions and pleasant."
"when in bloemendaal village (not bloemendaal aan zee) the best place for lunch or a nice cup of bocca cappuccino is fleurie. situated in the town centre near the train station. friendly staff, beautiful menu."
"i have been going with my wife and kids to fleurie for well over 6 years, often multiple times per week. the place has a relaxed atmosphere and the food is generally very good. i have to say the service is excellent too - mostly girls/women who are very welcoming and friendly. its all a bit hippyish - both in style and style of food but the quality never wavers. value for money is superb. "
"very nice lunchroom because they have healthy food, good portions and very friendly service. the atmosphere is also nice."
"i often come here in the morning to have a cappucino. they serve my favourite cappucino.   sometimes i havd lunch here with a nice tuna salad or steak tartare.   in summer, you can use the terrace.   lovely service tooüòò"
"the place for an informal coffee , nice lunch or relaxed dinner, great terrace when nice weather , child friendly, and lots of local delicacies , the place to relax and unwind"
"fleurie is the kind of place where you can go for a coffee/tea with friends or family. but the food is also excellent. lovely homemade quality. if you need a large table do reserve in advance. we had coffee, fresh mint tea and cakes and cookies. service very friendly. its always a pleasure to return. and as soon as the weather is warmer the terrace on the side walk is so nice. while shopping or stopping in bloemendaal, a great place to sit down and relax and enjoy the food and drinks."
"i visited fleurie on a sunday morning with my mother. its a lovely cosy place with a terrace in front. food and drinks are excellent, fresh and wholesome. local juices and produce. fresh bread, cakes , pastries and croissants. the best place for a sunday breakfast, coffee or lunch. well definitely be back. open 7 days a week from 10am-5pm and open for dinner (last call at 9pm) on fridays, saturdays and sundays. on tuesdays: fleurie aan tafel. one dish served for ‚Ç¨12,50. worth the detour if youre in haarlem."
easy going restaurant with pleasant terrace in front. lots of health food. located in the main shopping street of the old village of bloemendaal.
"big portions of pure food, service looks bit clumsy but has its charm and is willing and warm , its a local place where everyone knows each other which makes it look a bit strange for first time visitors, great place for kids"
"together with 7 ladies for a light lunch ,we were all impressed by the friendly staff and the ingredients of the food was superb. we only had entrees and dessert, a  grande desert. the cook outshined himself and we had trouble finishing all the delectables on our plates. it is ,i gather, opened till 5 each day, 7 days of the week and opened for evening meals friday through to and including sundays."
"it was a cold, snowy night when we visited the fleurie but what a wonderful, warm and cosy retreat it w "
the restaurant is beautifully located at the top of the dunes with a view even to the north sea. apart from great dutch pancakes  you can also order some other typical dutch food.
we had a most wonderful dinner the food and wine was excellent and the service was superb definitely will be a regular visitor üëå
"slightly remote from the city but close to nationaal park zuid-kennemerland, very good option for quiet evening... ambiance was great.. staff was very friendly and helpful. limited menu options, food quality was great, portions are good for one. overall very good experience"
"stopped for a short beverage and although there was only a dutch menu, the staff was very nice and helpful. sitting outside was very nice. the street was near but without major noise."
"we went here after a long day of work. the appatized of bread and different butter, pestos is really nice. then the start was really nice i had chateaubraind which was amazing."
"we found this restaurant by chance while cycling in the nearby national park. although not a specialist vegetarian restaurant, we all enjoyed the quorn wrap - lots of fresh vegetables! three portions was more than enough for 2 adults and 2 children, which the waitress was happy to serve. the puddings were good too."
amazing place for chilling out and having great food and drinks . we were there with family last year and wil come back again when we are at the beach.!!
"working in horeca i dont get much time off, especially now. today i was lucky enough for the weather to be beautiful so i went to the bea "
"located perfectly on the beach, the club has a very basic interior that offers plenty of room as a dance venue which is what the evening i attended was. the toilets were kept immaculate despite a very large crowd. only downsides were the lengthy queue to get in and the token system for the bar, both of which cost me a lot of time. "
fabulous beach club in this lovely dutch seaside to 
"walked several miles in the beach and found this place for lunch. great location, comfortable chairs, great service. also good choices, including very good gluten free bread. overall recommendable."
"what an amazing place to spend a sunny day.  good choice of beers on taps, tasty cocktails and a really good vibe."
attended for 3 days in a row for lumi trance festiv 
"great place for a sundowner! drinks, dinner, coffee and chill out place by the beach. stunning view when the sun shines and somewhere you could very easily spend many hours relaxing with friends. will be back for sure. made my first visit to bloemendaal very memorable."
a great venue for a beach party. ive been to luminosity here in 2015 and i will be returning again in 2016 for more!
beachclub fuel was one of the places on my party-bucketlist. and it stood up to the expectations during 2015s luminosity eve 
we had a very enjoyable me 
"i admire a restaurant that offers a light version of their entrees. we took advantage of this with their grilled salmon. it was served with full offering of side dishes, just a smaller fillet of salmon. great flavor, good service. when this restaurant is full it can get quite noisy, so sit next to each other if you want to talk. good value and great food. "
i‚Äôve just popped in here for a coffee but after looking through the menu i tried the vegetarian toastie. so glad i did as it was delicious. i‚Äôve read a couple of reviews saying it‚Äôs expensive which i disagree with. you get what you pay for and i‚Äôm happy with the price. the coffee came with a free bottle of water which you don‚Äôt get very ofte 
"we had the burger with fries and a salad. the food was tasty, fresh and i even received additional fries and appelmoes for free... just like that.  very friendly staff as well."
staff is well trained in gluten intolerance and celiac. some of the menu items can be prepared gluten free (dedicated fryer).
we often visit this restaurant on our hiking trips. never disapointed. during weekends and sunny days very crowded. but enough employees to keep it going. be prepared for waiting times.
"although it was very busy, we were serviced quickly, correctly and very friendly! food was great (in our case mussels and pancakes) so we decided to eat there the next day as well! they have a great variety of products, are very willing to adjust your order (e.g. what you would like on your pancake). one of their specialties is bakkums bakkie: coffee with a lot of extras (see photos)!"
"we have dined here a few times with our dutch family and always had great service, and great food in a lovely setting. plenty for kids to do too with colouring at the tables, an adventure playground and a petting zoo."
restaurant with small playground and little animal pen for the kids. nice as a stop before continuing on to beach.  food good but not fantastic. everything fresh. expensive. good selection for children. friendly service.
"this restaurant has a small petting zoo right outside. it is in an area of the dunes with walking trails, and we even saw a few people on horseback. the restaurant is prettily decorated and was nice and warm on a blustery day. we just had tea and hot chocolate, but those around us seemed to be enjoying their lunch. just the spot to warm up before heading back out for a brisk walk!"
"johannas hof is situated in a great spot, close to the dunes of castricum. several walking and cycling trails leave her and you can also rent bicycles. they have a nice large terrace, so if the weather is good there is ample opportunity to sit outside. they also have room for larger groups. we often have coffee or lunch here when we are walking in the dunes. the service can be a bit chaotic when there is a crowd, but the staff is very friendly even if it is busy and you have to wait a little bit long "
"this is an extremely popular busy place, which seems to cope well.  staff are very good and food is a good.  no frills, nice setting in dunes on the way to beach.  play area for kids and goats and birds to look at."
"good food, good service.  large outdoor area, large bike parking, small farm animal area for viewing.  great place to start or stop an outing into the sand dunes."
"after a chilly walk in the surrounding nature (6,6 km) we entered this large restaurant. we asked for apple cake and hot chocolate. the drink was very good. the apple cake was cold and missed the taste we had earlier in other restaurants (like markt 43 and zeezicht in amsterdam or dudok). a slice of strawberry on top of your whipped cream is unnecessary in january. we would have preferred a fresher, lukewarm version of the cake. service on the other hand was quick and friendly. its a professional eating factory."
"cosy, homely decor in spite of this being quite a large establishment. food is traditional dutch fare, served with a smile by very friendly and willing staff. its a great place to have lunch after a walk in the forest and there are plenty of outdoor facilities for children."
"johannas hof is located in a very scenic location, on the edge of de hoep nature reserve, thats well worth visiting in its own right. friendly and fast(for nl) service from the waiters, enjoyable food, great play area for kids, we love it."
"ive been here to a wedding party at night. it is located a bit outside the city, there is enough parking space and there is a small farm outside. the party was nice, well organized with drinks and music. the only negative point was that it was too hot inside, some fans would be ni "
the atmosphere created by the owner makes you feel like coming home. mixing that with nice classic bistro food and one of the wines advised by that same lady makes up for a good evening eating out!
"due to living abroad not been there for quite a few years. it was such a great pleasure to experience once more their pleasant hospitality. some very nice changes have been made to the interior. and the food? very tasteful, lovely presented and very good quality. wish we could visit more often."
"stumbled across this place whilst out cycling, nice place for a light lunch, they do good work with the local community. would definitely go back again"
"we were taken her by our friends, whom we were visiting from australia and very much enjoyed it. the servings where very tasty and plentiful and the staff was very attentive especially towards the kids."
"today this was my second visit to this place. it is not really a caf√© but also not a proper restaurant. the food is all organic and with some sophistication. some people who work here have disabilities and work in a nice, relaxed atmosphe "
wandered around the street and found this for a casual dinner. terrific service from a lady that put up with our lack of dutch language and was able to interpret our australian. we had a really good meal at reasonable cost. note that our australian credit cards and debit cards would not work.

"we found this nice little restaurant. it does have a nice atmosphere. we had a window seat which is a nive place to watch other people. the food was quite good. we had a table of 4 and all the people were enjoying their food. the service was very friendly but a bit slow. it took 2.5 hours for a regular 3 course meal. we had hope for a quick(er) diner. having said that the black angus was very good as were the vegetables. their is a square close by were you can park the car. the restaurant is opened only on friday, saturday and sunday"
"the service was very quick and the food was well above the normal, a friendly waitress looked after us with our food and drink , the restaurant was very airy and had seating inside and outside , the toilets were very clean , thanks again for a memorable meal"
"with a group of 12 (most senior citizens) we had an excellent dinner a la carte; the order were taken efficiently and delivery was fast thanks to efficioent waitresses and wireless contact with the kitchen. after a lunch the previous day - which was very good, we decide to book for dinner the next day. it has been a long time since we had such good food for such a very reasonbale/cheap price, and at the same time an efficient service."
"we went to pesos with a group on nine persons. we had different kinds of tapas for entree. they were delicious and they offerder plenty of them. i could have managed without main course, i was already filled up after tapas. sangria was excellent and there was fresh stawberries in it, nice touch! staff was friendly and they spoke good engli "
been here a couple of times and will come back! the food is really nice for the price and the staff is always friendly! usually book before(just in case) as it can get really bu 
not my first time to this restaurant but this time i was spoiled at my visit from canada here along with some of my family from asten nl. a great place with a mexican touch. again friendly staff and hard working to make sure you are always waited on with your next drink or appetizers. i will return here for sure. the tortilla lasagna was delicious
"we had lunch here today and it was very good. finally an omelette the way it should be. nice coffee, good atmosphere, quick and polite service."
glad to have this restaurant close to where we live. the food is excellent. according to us they should at least have one michelin star (if not two)
"every visit a highlight!  creative food paired with excellent wines. outstanding service, absolutely professional but at all times down to earth and providing a friendly and cosy atmosphere. we had the luck of a nice summer evening being served on the beautiful garden terras. top!"

"very good and prompt service, delicious food. the portions were huge. offered ouzo before and after the meal, as well as the starter from the chef"
generous portions all well prepared foo 
"as a couple with two teens, we were very pleasantly surprised with this little corner of greece in rosmalen, north brabant, netherlands. right after sitting in their cozy dining room, we were greeted with complimentary glasses of ouzo (for the kids, same glasses but with apple juice). then, a complimentary entr√©e (champignons filled with shrimp in a delicious tomato-based sauce) and bead, really delicious. we ordered two other entr√©es (very copious portions, one dish being plenty for 2 or 3 people). wife and kids ordered grilled dishes and they loved them! i ordered the stifado, a beef stew in a rich sauce of small onions, cinnamon, black pepper and clove, with fries and rice as sides... despite being already quite full, i couldnt help but finish it, so succulent it was! my youngest still had a chocolate souffl√© with vanilla ice cream and chantilly cream and i got a nice expresso. we were very impressed with the sympathy and helpfulness of the waiters; all were super friendly, without exception. and then came the owner, who is really a character, super friendly, with whom we still had a good laugh. all in all, a very positive experience, both in gastronomic terms as well as in terms of service. i strongly recommend this nice place to anyone looking for a generous, authentic and delicious meal for a very fair price, including families with kids."
"the buffet allowed for many options, theres about something for everyone, including a good choice set for kids. the wok station allowed you to make your own wok mix which i personally loved. the place was a bit on the crowded side for my taste but that was because of rush hours. i arrived there hungry, and a few hours later i went out with a few extra kilos gained, i just couldnt stop eating. "
"despite the limitations that the restaurants need to adhere to, the atmosphere, service, and food was excellent."
"best all you can eat restaurant ive ever been to! the choice is endless and the food is delicious, exceeds expectations and worth more than what you pay. great service and a wonderful ambiance. i especially loved sitting by the window, the perfect restaurant lighting. i could sit there for hours and i just cannot wait to be back there again!"
ate here with my wife on a friday evening. called ahead 30 min in advance and we were lucky to get a table. place was very busy and lively with all types of peopl 
"very good ayce experience with colleagues, very good variety of food: japanese, dutch, soups, international, teppanyaki. good service, place is nice. price is time based, two hours for 20 eur. excellent."
"great homemade snacks, excellent price/quality and very fast service. even if the place is packed with people (and it regularly is quite literally packed). still you can expect to be served within 15 minutes, no matter how busy it is. and if you want even faster service, phoning in the order, is even faster."
"great service they were very patient with an american like me, friendly people, very clean, good food everything looked great. glad we stopped and i would go back."
"went here after visiting the local archery shop for lunch.  very good food!  burger was very nice, as was the brie tosti."
"the restaurant has got a charming view on the church of diessen, it is located on the sunny side of the road. good service and great wine and beers served."
"this location is an authentic old brabant farm, which serves nice beers, pancakes and other meals . very cosy and excellent, friendly staff."
"always tricky to find a place that is good for young children, parents, grandparents and friends. but this place caters to all. the selection off pancakes will satisfy any child. than they are of to the play area (either in or outside). the ‚Äúgrownups‚Äù sit back and enjoy drinks, bites or an set meal. it‚Äôs all good. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. great fun for all!"
"having been disappointed with closed restaurants in tilburg we opted for lots and we are so happy we did.   cozy interior, great food and the cutest team of waiters ever seen; seriously!   worth many more visits."

"they make the fresh icecream themselves and tastes great! (even better than many gelaterias that i visited on my recent holidays to italy). they have a wide selection of tastes, which they vary on a regular bas "
"swedish restaurant, very authentic and basic. quality is very high and all the typical dishes are available. highly recommended."

"we had a very nice evening in a beautiful decoraties place. they serve lot‚Äôs of small dishes so you get to try a lot or repelt when you like it. service was very good, friendly and fast. the only small negative could be that you sit very close to the next table in some places."
"a broad choice of different kind of tapas (not only spanish dishes) and a fast service. make sure you have a reservation, because its always fully booked! looking forward to my next visit!"

very friendly and good quality tasty food. i only had a main course and a desert. everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. certainly worth visiting.
it was my first visit to this restaurant. i was in the center of bergeijk looking for somewhere nice to eat. my i fell on the italian looking name. it looked clean from the outside with some people eating. so i went in and was surprised by the place. i had only the maincourse because i didnt have much time. i chose the seabass. it was very fresh and tasty. friendly and fast service. fully enjoyed it. will surely visit again.
"we eat here very often as it‚Äôs a lovely local italian, fresh ingredients, simple and not too heavy. the staff are very friendly and super accommodating and will adapt dishes when needed. they even always bring a lovely little amuse bouche! worth a visit!"
"we were there for camping and we went out for dinner due to someones birthday and we are all italian food lover, so we found this one. review says its good and we tried already once, they were fully booked (that is why we knew it should be good as in such small town, food much be good to be fully booked for dinner still!). the food we all had are really good; if you put the reults of michelin star restaurants, this restaurant purely bring you simply good food, simple but good service; nothing else. if you are a good food lover, you would enjoy as much as we do. you must try it if you are in the neighborho "
"it was our fourth visit to this wonderful restaurant and every single visit we have been ecstatic ! i started with a delicious home made bouillon and my husband had coquilles with parma ham. as a main, we both had the saltimbocca. the taste was very italian (having lived in italy we know what that means !) and extremely tasty. we ended with their excellent coffee, although we were very tempted by their desserts, but alas, age is creeping up on as, so we try to watch our calories ! this was all delivered with a natural elegance, attention and kindness in a very pleasant setting, the latter especially now they have added their wonderful (non-smoking) conservatory."
"found ourselves in bergeyk unexpectedly and did a quick check on tripadvisor to find somewhere to eat. pleased we chose buon gusto, it was a really nice location on the edge of a market square. good range on the menu. pasta dishes looked great from what we saw of other peoples. we had veggie lasagna and victoriabaars (nile perch apparently, not something ive ever had before) - both were excellent. nice wine and beer. no kids menu - my daughter only wanted soup anyway so this wasnt a problem. i think they would have done a small portion of a main meal if wed asked. friendly service. only complaint was that we asked for desert at 10pm only to be told that, although they were still serving drinks, the kitchen was closed! would have been nice to know that earlier."
dropped in for an evening meal on a quiet sunday evening. the service was friendly and attentive. the food was delicious and the decor/ambience pleasant. best restaurant in the area by far.
"great dedicated chef, friendly service in a small restaurant on a lovely square in the town centre. i had one of the most delicious chicken dishes. my husband had the rack of lamb which he much appreciated. it was accompanied by a few stir fried (?) veg and a great risotto. their wines are excellent and many of these organic. good fresh coffee ! this was our second visit and obviously we will be back."

"i came in the morning for a quick coffee before my journey to toverland for the day. it wasnt too crowded on a sunday morning. they have different stations where you order your food. i ordered and paid at the coffee station. midway through my order, i realized i forgot to say that i wanted to take my coffee to go. she poured it into a plastic cup. maybe to go cups with insulation and lids arent a regular thing here. on that cold morning, the coffee chilled quickly outsid "

i liked everything about the place but not so keen on the people on the  next table (cant have everything)
"we stopped in here driving back from hamburg because it was just off the highway and im glad we did. this was a charming restaurant. although the access road is bit tricky (go behind the petrol station not in front of it) there is plenty of parking. the decor may be a bit kitschy but i thoroughly enjoyed it. they had vegetarian dishes as well, and the portions were very generous. it was a very enjoyable stop. although it is close to the highway, it sits down and off the roads in a very nice open park area."
we are on our 5th day staying at this lovely holiday park. we are so glad we chose this place and already don‚Äôt want to leav

excellent fresh food with a twist.  lovely interior and exterior and a most interesting little boutique.

"especially when its as good as here. holland has lots of asian restaurants due to the colonial past. many are okay. seldom one is bad. some however are very good. like this. my favorites so far: the mihun, babi pangang and garlic chicken."
"located in the city center of tegelen, this chinese restaurant offers a huge selection of asian dishes. the quality of food is really good and the service is excellent."
booked a table for a group. just the nearest oriental restaurant to our hotel. generic chinese interior. extremely nice and efficient server. food very tasty and fast to come. you dont get disappointed.
"the outside of the restaurant is very simple and not very inviting. but you should overcome your hesitations. the restaurant offers excellent meals and rice dishes, chinese, indonesian and cantonese. the staff is very friendly and professional - i.e. is able to take care of the finishing touch at the table of the guest."
old abbey. nice food and nice atmosphere. enjoyed asperges soup. quite a distance from tegelen center but if you combine it with a hiking route it is just a small detour
you are on a hill shaped by the rhine. the lower part you were passing was shaped by the maas river. and you are in between countries where you can taste smell and see the atmosphere of an old monastery
"next to the old monastery ulingshof, where the emmaus foundation resides. wonderful special beers, delicious local foods and an epic housing. nice staff. i love the lamb dish and the naughty goat. visit the thrift store in the monastery too."

"finally weve got some time to give the new fancy thematic caf√© in the makado mall a try. we still didnt hear anything about it so weve made our choices in the dark. what a lovely surprise. my husband ordered a kipsat√© that was tasteful and juicy, as he said. my burger was beyond good, was truly the best i ever had. you could taste that it was not the cheap frozen meat what we see everywhere. it was fresh, nicely seasoned, tender, juicy, a party in the mouth. i think what makes the difference at bickels is that everything is fresh made. forget about those makro potted salads on your plate or the traditional fries. everything meal there is properly prepared. way to go, the region missed a quality place like this. youve earned a frequent client!"
"raaaaaah this munch was most devious. some proper italian stallion skran. mandem arrived and the donnys put some meat and bread down before a word was even ushered man felt like royalty. man ordered a beer and it came bare cold like the north pole and dat. these mandem, gyaldem and theydem bare technological and whip out the ipad if u want wine. got man perplexed at the variety of drank. man ordered the pesto ting and the meal was volcanic, bare hot man be careful out here or u will lose a bud or two init. menu lil lacking variety but still got some villainous munch, wallet didnt enjoy it but man did. no paigons in sight either the bossmen, gyaldem and theydem were bless. big up."
"worth going, great authentic food, so not a dutch version of italian dishes. very pleasant spacious indoor tables and large outdoor area. the service was very pleasant, the food yummy, simply a wonderful experience. definitely worth coming back to and deserves to be in the michelin guide!"
"one of the more authentic italian restaurants i have been to in the netherlands (being an italian myself)  great dinner, good quality ingredients, nice and friendly service, nice ambience and well spaced out tables.  would definitely return !"
"an hour away from where we live, but every time its totally worth it. the staff couldnt be better and the chefs skills are simply outstanding. pure top quality ingredients delivering your moneys worth!"
we went already at 18.00pm and only had two hours because of the babysit. they offered us a very nice 3-course dinner and the service was really good. we love to bring a visit in the new accommodation.
"such an enjoyable evening. chic decor, friendly welcome & service. food delicious as always and no rush. if you want a relaxed dinner, time to talk and enjoy good food & wine there‚Äôs no better pla "
"i have been here on multiple occasions and the food and ambiance have always been superb! the pasta is excellent and always fresh, just as the vegetables, which are by the way picked from their own garden! also their secondis (meat/fish plates) are impeckable, same goes for their desserts (you should have the merenque - flawless "
decided to eat here with some friends after reading the review 
"i have really enjoyed our sunday night visit to pasta e vino: the service was impeccable, the hosts very welcoming, prepared and friendly (i was surprised by the knowledge of the waiter about the nonino grappas! actually, i was surprised they even had them there :)  "
fabulous experience. had a super meal in a fantastic atmosphere. friendly service and casual with class and style. loved the laughter og the waitress/owner:-)

"one of the most amazing place ive experienced in my gourmet life! imagine a posh village in limburg, close to a nice church, the most authentic-modern italian restaurant you can imagin "
we had a family meal in this restaurant and staff went out of their way to make the evening a memorable one! the kids food was tailored to their likings and they even got dishes that were not on the menu. advice on wine was excellent as these wines were amongst the nicest weve ever had! will definitely return here!!!
"we are americans living in beek for a couple of years and we kept hearing that we should check out this restaurant. so i booked a table for 10 for my birthday in july and it was fantastic! great italian food, great wine and slightly pricey but totally worth it. there are not too many restaurants i have liked in the nl so this is pretty high praise from me ;). its great for a romantic evening or a special occasion and we had great service (also rare!). we hope to go back! (i wish i would have taken more pictures!)"
we have been visiting pasta e vino frequently for over 20 years . only the fact that we still look out for a next occassion is enough to make it our favorite italian in the southern netherlan

"with the birthday of my mom, i recommend to come here  loved it, good food, nice personal great cook!  i come here already for years with a lot of pleasure! i recommend to ... everyone."
"was invited for the wedding diner and left the building with a big smile. the staff paid attention to the children with a small variety of courses and deserts to choose from without coming up with cliches ( french fries and a snack ). as a guest you were presented with a small card ( a choice of course from the newly weds ) out of which it was hard to choose since everything sounded tempting. my choice, broccoli soup and a fish strudel, was really jummy. should pay a bit more attention to whom ordered what, since being there with children that ask your attention and also paying attention to questions of waitresses, can make it a bit restless. but with children and dessert, it all of a sudden became qui "

"we had a lovely dinner in the small town,  the personal was very friendly. we had a fish salad and a chicken salad both delicious!"
the gouverneur panini was lovely and the kids lunch meals were reasonably priced. the kids that had the cheese and ham toasties said they were tasty. the lady who served us was friendly and helpful. my only gripe was that (after translation) the kids little pancakes should have come with syrup and sugar and came with neither. should have perhaps complained or perhaps google translate wasnt up to scratch!?
"i was in vaals last weekend and had a meal at thessaloniki on saturday. friendly service, pleasant surroundings and a very tasty gyros.the price was right too. recommendable"
"i regularly get chips here and i really love them! great value and the staff is really nice, can definitely recommend!üòä"
exactly how a good friture should be and has been for decades. we never visit vaals without a friet zuurvlees. quick service with a smile.
stumbled upon this up the hill side out of epen it is definitely not closed had beer and good snacks served by kind people  yes a fantastic autumnal view
"we have been coming to lodge 7 for more than 10 years on and off. today we ate the goulash soup, it was delicious. homemade, tasty and warming on a winters day. keep up the extra lunch specials it‚Äôs nice to be able to choose something different from the regular menu. "
"the best of this restaurant is the location, the view is absolutely great!! however the food is also very good, we were really pleased with our choices and the staff was really friendly and happy to help."
we were here today and it was fine. it was very busy and the service and quality of the french fries is decreasing.  the  ‚Äòkroketten‚Äô were good. we will be here less often.
"nice restaurent at e distance from the bilderberg hotel kasteel vaalsbroek, beatifull view , nice atmosphere in the lodge"
my husband and i come here regularly. the restaurant has a beautiful setting and the view is amazing. the waiters are super kind and make sure you have the best time. the food is amazing. the chef has the ability to give every dish a special flavor! i would recommend this restaurant to everybody that wants a special moment.
magnificent view and where theres served very good coffee. we had a great relaxing time there after a very good walk in the woods. the service is excellent and the people are very friendly. a very good place to sit back and relax
"an excellent place to enjoy the scenery, good coffee with limburger vlaai (try the forest fruit one). its a bit pricey but worth it for the relaxed atmosphere and view."
"this restaurant sits at the base of the wilhelminatoren named after the queen wilhelmina of the netherlands. it offers a view of the valley below. it is near drielandpunt. the area at which three countries, belgium, germany and the netherlands, meet at one point which is also near the highest point in the netherlands, a dizzying 372.5 meters elevation above sea lev "
"thanks for a great evening with unexpectedly great food. just went for the kids menu but in the end all adults had an excellent meal, served with great local hospitality! love from the australians from limburg!"
"during our holiday in vaals we tried this restaurant and with my parents that eat greek food often, we found that the food was delicious! the service was great and helpfu "
we ate here whilst staying in the area and were impressed with the menu and the amount of food served. the service was efficient and the complimentary ouzo very nice!!
"lots of food at a decent price, very friendly service.  variety of food available so everyone could find a good meal.  good quality food!"
"lakis is a very nice restaurant. we had the salmon with lemon sauce. well done. the restaurant gave us a complimentary ouzo, very greek, very nice."
i stopped by for a coffee and to warm up on a cold morning while visiting three country point. pleasant traditional decor with efficient service and a good sized coffee served with a small biscuit
"we visited the drielandenpunt and after walking around, we wanted to eat something before getting on the road. all the restaurants were not open, maybe because of the season. im glad this one was the one we chose. i loved the old fashion decor and furniture. our food was superb and we sat in front of the fireplace to break the chill of the rainy day. i high recommend this restaurant if you are visiting either of the attractions surrounding the restaurant."
"the range of guests at this restaurant ranged from friends to hikers to travelers and all are welcome. we stopped in for a bite for lunch and found it quite pleasant. we shared a bar pie while we watched the servers take care of guests at the bar, or the dining room or just the family on the couch by the open fireplace. it was a nice little stop along the way."
"our family spent 5 nights at the kasteel bloemendhal hotel and we were so appalled at the service by the restaurant and staff that we decided to dine in this italian restaurant across the road from the hotel........the dining experience and food was so good we went there twice more.......the owners thea and sjaak are the owners and wilma is the server and each one greets you with a beaming smile and a real sense of friendliness that the restaurant staff in the hotel are somewhat lacking. we have tried three different choices from the menu and each time the food has been superb. each meal is freshly prepared and so tasty and piping hot that you would be hard to find better in italy .....or anywhere else actually. also the price, it is very reasonable too which is an added bonus. but what makes this establishment so good is the warm welcome and attentiveness of the staff........thank you for making our holiday that much better because we really pressed for dining options at the hotel. (a review of our stay at the hotel will be posted on the hotel so "
"we have stayed in vaals 3 nights (hotel incl. 2 dinners) and had dinner here one evening. it was quiet around 21h00 monday evening. we could sit on the terrace. later on the lady asked if we wished another table because there in the corner it was a bit less windy. very kind. food was very good. we had al forno dishes. for me it was very nice but too much. so, you can ask a smaller portion, the owner told me. a nice and good suggestion. i dont if we would return to vaals or neighbourhood, but if we should, we would return to bellissima !"
casual italian with really good food. the people that work there are super friendly. i had the lasagna it was really good and i would come back here again.
"nice restaurant, very clean and light , delicious food , very good service. they have everything on the menu you expect in a pizzeria and a nice choice of wine ."
ate here one evening whilst on holiday and we were really impressed with everything about this restaurant. the pizzas and lasagne were amazing and the staff really friendly. although it was very quiet it has a lovely atmosphere and was decorated really well with beautiful lighting. would definitely recommend a visit.
"this is the chinese restaurant to go to when youre in the neighborhood of renkum. the meals are very good, the buffet every friday, saturday and sunday is more than recommendable and the staff is very friendly and helpful."
"the four of shared a chinese / indian buffet; 23 euro pp for a soup of our choice, a selection of wonderful tasting dishes and a dessert or coffee/tea. very varied flavours, the meat was succulent and moist, good service and very reasonably priced for what we got. highly recommend it; also helped that we had spent the day cycling :-) so we all enjoyed a good appetite on the night."
"despite very average street appeal, we experienced one of the best asian meals ever in this location. exquisite tastes, all super fresh, tasty and not blazing hot. good service and easy location, especially on a bike."
"looking for affordable chinese dining or take out? this is a little hidden gem. go here for really tasty chinese food and excellent service. the ambiance is a little outdated, but for good food, go here!"
mouth watering dinner: mushroom soup was a delight. the spareribs was tender and fell of the bone. and as dessert a creme br√ªl√©e made from blood oranges. . we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste and the fine staff!
"the food was good, well cooked, and generous portions. the wine was fine, and the deserts outstanding."
we had the guests menu and we can recommend as a good choice. also a good presentatton of the food. service ok.

"we stopped here for lunch. really nice looking place, clean,good food and service and see that it has rooms as well.if we are back this way ,would consider stay here as well."
"we loved the food and the view on the lake and beach. we were here last year a week on the park and sat a few times at the terrace. some people of the staff were friendly, others less. theres also a beachclub, which is a few meters away on the beach. we liked sitting here, the menucard is smaller than from the restauran "

we had lunch here during our bike tour. friendly staf and good service. relaxed atmosfere with a nice terrace.
"reasonably priced dutch and international cuisine with good choice of beers. friendly service. menus available in english and as is the norm in the netherlands, the waitresses all spoke excellent english."
"druten is not on most travellers books. an old market town some 30 kilometers upstream from the old roman city of nijmegen does have some claim to historical fame. its highbrick built steppled roman catholic church stands on the site of the largest pleasure house the romans built when they controlled the western bank of the rhine in the days of yore. this old market town has one of the largest cattle markets in the region. once a year druten is home to what is in english as the last market. a place where people from these lands, that lie between too great western european rivers that flow out to the north sea, speak a polygot of dialects. on the newly paved market square a modern design facade tells you that a restaurant serving greek and other mediterranean crusines to a well travelled rural dutch public. the food is of high quality and echoes the high standard of the several well established schools hotel and restaurant management that can be found in this country. a family group of twelve people coming together to a wake for a much loved person who as an elderly lady had enjoyed the food and service in the past year or two were pleased to find that the excellence of the cook was not diminished when a glass of wine was of pleasing proportions. there was no need to ask if there was anything wrong with the wine waiters elbow as my old mum had once said when her glass looked half empty. for the historian the land between the rivers is where many of the most bloody battles were fought between the dutch and the spanish during the time that spain was spreading its dominions into the calvanist north of europe. there are many old castles and the cycle routes along the banks of the rivers are a delight. but then so is the lovely surprise of a greek restaurant so far away from the mountainous land of myths and where philosophers were found in great abundance. a more to the point the food really tastes good. but then you must find that out for yourself."
friendly service.  great food.  good location.  daily menu is very nice.  ala carte option also.  good selection of drinks.
"as lovers of good food we are so happy for having discovered this restaurant in nijkerk. not only does this restaurant serve a new menu every other week, they do it excellently with a choice of meat, fish or vegatarian, but they do this with friendly service and time for you as a gue "
"we chose the 4 course menu, which was only 27 euro but we were blown off our feet by the quality of the food. portions were spot on ( given the 4 courses ), seasoning and textures simply amazing. the staff also had some excellent wine suggestions, even though they werent trained for it. we can highly recommend it."
pleasant experience. four people took the 4-course dinner that is very reasonably priced. one of us had it gluten free and was pleased to find that extra measures were taken to make sure the meal was equally satisfying. well definitely go back.
"pleasant service, nice food with a good and well prepared. interesting setting in the industrial area, but do not let that scare you away :). best value for money i have had for a very long time."
"the location of this restaurant is not the most favourable, although situated along the river. a bit of the beaten track, it does a good job of attracting customers. the ambiance is nice, the service friendly and knowledgable and the food is inventive and very tasty. they will accomodate almost any dish to your allergies and still make it taste wonderful."

"we had a superb dinner at salentein bistro: cosy atmosphere, nice table, very friendly waitress, constructive chat with the chef who is working in the open kitchen in the center of the bistro. the entrecote was excellent and big. together with a bottle of salentein malbec dinner at this bistro was a real experience."
"please note, my notes and review concern the restaurant part, theres also the so-called bodega part and i am less happy about that part, so i always reserve at the restaurant part. variety of the menu is great and changes every now and then, also seasonally influenced. both fish and meats are good, just go here and experience it for yourself."

"without wishing to be rude to nijkerk, the phrase middle of nowhere might have been made for it, so how good to be taken to this restaurant for fine wine and good food. i would heartily recommend any of the beef dishes featuring meat from the salentein estates either here or in argentina. a real treat."
"one of the culinary attractions of the veluwe region is restaurant de salentein on the centuries old estate of the same name. it is spacious and is tastefully decorated, whereas the service is good. a remarkable feature is that de salentein owns vineyards and cattle in argentina, salentein wines and beef are, therefore, on the menu. our guests were vegetarians but that was no problem, the cook prepared tasty food specially for them. we ourselves chose roasted pheasant. all of us enjoyed the salentein sauvignon blanc."
"i had lunch here in december.  the restaurant is in a really nice location, with beautiful countryside around it. the food was top quality, with good combinations of flavours and the service was attentive."
"in town on business and encouraged by other ta reports, i decided to step away from the limited, rather typically overpriced bar menu and took a 15 minute stroll to this establishme "
"our hotel advised us that portillo bar bodega (connected to de salentein) was one of the best restaurants in the vicinity and they were correct! its quite a beautiful place, surrounded by green fields. we were welcomed warmly by the hostess and seated next to the open kitchen, where we could see everything the cooks were doing. the waiter kindly explained about the concept of the (fresh off the land) meats they served. the service and the food was impeccable. the olive oil was so good, we bought a large bottle to take home with us. we will definitely return when in the neighborhood!"
it was a warm and sunny day so we could enjoy the well situated terrace. because it was weekend the huge outside grill was fired up so the suggestion was easy: meat! i had the entrecote together with a delicious malbec. simply the best i ever h

"had a 4-5 hour lunch, of several courses with 4 other friends out on the terrace. the food was varied and excellent, the service perfect, selection of wines from their own wineries gorgeous. the ambiance added to one of the best dining experiences i have had....well worth the visit."
"whilst enjoying a drink in the lobby, the staff informed us that a prominent dutch car importer, traveling the world, got stuck in panama and ultimately arrived in argentina where he laid the basis for a farm raising cattle and growing wine. the lovely little castle just northeast from nijkerk has hosted the car importers headquarters, but now is home to a restaurant-cum-grillroom. evidently, the beef and wines of the argentinian farm are featured on the menu list. we visited the restaurant - very pleasant, highly attentive service and excellent food. of course, it comes at a price. those with a smaller budget should have dinner at the grillroom, which we didnt visit this time - but certainly will do so shortly!,"

"this place belongs to the woods. it is available since 800. it is romantic and charming. we decided to eat the specitate, what our cute waiter recommended. the meal was deer stew. but oh, the meat was so tasty with the mashed potato and rhubarb. just amazing with the red wine from 2010. we ate pancake as well with ice cream and hot fruits. i really want to come back! the place is truly recommend "
"after a nice long walk in the woods we came across boshuis drie , actually de buurtjes which is a next door to boshuis drie. the restaurant is located in very old building dating back to the 17th centu "
"beautiful located in the middle of the forest close to the city of putten you find this restaurant serving lunch and diner, very reasonable priced, large selection, terrace and friendly staff"
"we had a lunch in boshuis drie after a long hike through the forest. they offer a nice lunch menu, pancakes seems to be the favorite of many customers. we had the erwtensoep (peasoup) and it tasted delicious."
we visited the restaurant and also their little giftshop. prices in the giftshop are excellent and the food and the service in the restaurant very good as well!
"excellent food. menu only in dutch (which is always a good sign that the place is serving locals rather than tourists), however everybody spoke english and were happy to translate. secret stew was a bit too sweet for my taste, but overall both food and service were great. and my son got a sparkling candle for his birthday! id recommend booking as the place was absolutely full."
"bellini‚Äôs pizza and pasta is a decent formula italian located at strand horst, exit 11 of the a28 on the northbound route. great opportunity for a fairly quick meal with better quality than at the neighbouring golden arches. on tuesday they have pizza night, and on wednesday pasta night - all menu items for 10 euros. big helpings. not bad!

"after attending a show at the place des arts a group of five friends decided to go for dinner in old montreal. the bonaparte is an old favorite of mine and it did not disappoint. a last minute reservation made on line was confirmed. we arrived before the restaurant opened at 5.30 so had drinks in the small bar, entertained by the bar man mixing the drinks for us. then into the dining room where we had excellent service and the food was delicious. the final touch was that the bills were presented to us and everything, including the pre dinner drinks were assigned to the correct bill. altogether a delightful evening after a great sh "
"we were attracted to this restaurant by its external appearance and had two lovely experiences there during our short stay in the area. it has a very nice feel and atmosphere. first we had a morning coffee with gateau and then, on another day, lunch. good choice and excellent value for money. would certainly return there on our next visit. highly recommended."
"nicely renovated place. friendly staff and good food. there`s a nice outside terrace, but also inside there`s a cosy atmosphere."
"we love this coffee house in the beautiful village of ermelo. we have visited it many times over the years and it has always been a pleasure. the venue is always relaxing, comfortable, clean and well presented with coffee, tea, chocolates and gifts available. the menu is varied and delicious. the staff are incredibly polite & helpful. we would definitely recommend a visit! (bonus is that next door is a wonderful bookstore)."
"a wonderfulp place where the let people have a job in the community. this initiative is alone is only worth praising, but the whole place is great. an average menu, but they sell chocolate, coffee, tea, cups, etc.. very friendly for the kids and a great service."
good food and very friendly service for a reasonable price on the main street. theres also a nice bonbonnerie.
"we started with a cup of cappucino. good size cup, with lots of creamy foam, and coffee that was at the right temperature. this is how a cappucino should  "
"nice place, good food, fair priced.  nice terrace, feels like a little gem when sunny whether. inside oranjerie, many options.  the food court is just 200 meeter from the castle and its more museum"
the oranjerie is ideally located in combination with a visit to the castle. you enjoy the beautiful sight on the gardens and the castle. service is prompt and friendly here. there is a good variety of dishes on the menu. coffee is good and the carrot cake delicious. friendly staff. busy terrace and still quick servi 
enjoyed a tea with ginger and orange and some carrot cake. both were really very nice. the carrot cake a full size and the tea a full high glass. service great and attentive.
we had lunch with a group if four. the service was excellent and quick and the quality of the food was also nice. prices are quite reasonable and the setting is beautiful in the garden. all in all something not to miss if you vist the museum (more) and want to have a bite in a beautiful setting. the terrace in the summer seems fantastic to me. but it was a little could now.
"it‚Äôs really beautiful here and i love the yellow , really worthwhile having a cup of coffee and something of the menu !"
"this place has a perfect view of castle ruurlo/more and you can enjoy eating or having drinks on the terrace or inside even if you dont plan to go to the castle (but you should, because it is beautiful)."
"great pancakes, quick service, amused the place is a park for gnomes. will come back here again next time we are in the country."
"after a bike-ride on a very hot day, we (party of six) ended at this restaurant. they specialize in pancakes, and three of us made a choice out of an impressive list. the other three made different choices. i can recommend the sandwich with ossenworst, local speciality. very tasty!"
"the dutch like pancakes, especially children. de heikamp offers excellent pancakes (loads of specialties) at reasonable prices. great playing area for children, nice walking tracks for both children and adults."
"de heikamp never disappoints with their pancakes and friendly atmosphere in the woods. i have yet to stray away from my staple choice (spekpannenkoek), but i don‚Äôt feel the need either because they do do a good standad panca "
"so pancakes, dutch pancakes are a rather cheap product. flour, eggs, milk and then toppings (normally sweet but can also be served with vegetable). it does not explain the price for some of the pancakes (around 16 euros). given the place is nice, really nice and the staff is friendly. i would recommend lowering the price and make profit on volume not on units. simple math and happier more frequent returning customers!"
"not really haute-cuisine, but just very good food for a decent price. staff was very friendly and helpful, volunteered to move a few tables around to offer us a nie place for six to e "
"nice restaurant in the centre of ruurlo. has a nice feel to it. friendly staff, good food and the prices are on point. no typical diner food, this has more class to it. only downside is the small wine card: one red, one white and one rose wine available. "
"staff is very friendly, they have joy in their work and that sho "
"local dutch pancakes, delicious taste and idyllic atmosphere in the country side. perfect for family or couple visit."
the food was simple but delicious and the staff very welcoming. the dining room is big and has a cozy fireplace in the middle which gives a homey feelin 
"think quality not quantity. we ate on the √° la carte restaurant. for the larger eaters go ahead and order extra side of potatoes. food was super!! with our drinks we were given olives and veggie chips. after ordering, bread tomato tampenade arrived. food arrived and was delicious!! bit of veggies, nice celery with apple salad and a small portion of fries. again, larger eaters ask for large fries or get the extra potatoes... both super delicious! come here when you want to be pampered but not broke, prices are reasonable for the ambiance / location. "

gorgeous location along a waterway overlooking a small bridg 
we have visited this restaurant  numerous times over the past several years. the food is always excellent especially the rhubarb sauce. the owners are delightful to talk to and go out of their way to help us with our limited nederlands vocabulary
"very friendly staff, very nice view on the lake! too bad the weather wasnt cooperating. not too many dishes on the menu, but the quality was excellent! we (2 persons) had dinner for under 50 euros."
"beautiful view over the water. we had fried egg with bacon, cheese and ham. a tasty filling meal with great value. a coffee to end the meal was what you could always expect."
food was good although rare steak was medium. very good value for money and lovely outlook from the terrace.
the most important feature of dald wal is certainly its locatio

"came here on a recommendation after a day of sailing and was unexpectedly served a very respectable smoked salmon tartar with lemon mayonnaise and some diced, marinated cucumber. the burger was also pretty decent. we were seated waterside on a canal lined with old wooden boats (and a couple of dinghies) and the service was quick and friendly - despite the evening rush."
very handsome converted mansion in the middle of beetsterzwa 
"we had great experience with fantastic service by our server,  we let the chef decide which steak to choose which he did....what we got terrific made for perfection with fantastic side dishes."
had a very simple lunch in this quaint little town. was on a monday when most stores were closed. so go later in the week. most are also closed on tuesdays. menu is simple. very good mushroom soup and sandwich.
"nice environment, good food and friendly staff. although there are a lot of high quality hotels and restaurants in beetsterzwaag, we recommend this place."
"we were there on a lazy sunday afternoon,in august, rather quiet. nice menu, and our choice was enjoyable. the personal however, looked a little bit bored. that is a pity, and a loss, because after all: we are paying guests!!"
"located in a pretty suburban town, the restaurant offers quality, tasty local cuisine in a nicely decorated dining room that is at once touched by elegance yet far from stuffy. they also offer a nice variety of cocktails and the wine list is compact but will appeal to all palates at reasonable prices. the service is friendly and efficient and this is great place to while away a couple of hours over aperitifs, dinner, wine and perhaps a dijestif. highly recommended. expect to pay about 40-45 euros per person for a 3 course meal without drinks."
"outstanding service, facilities, food quality/variety and cleanliness. excellent value for the money. was above expectations."
"second time to eat dinner at voorhuys restaurant emmeloord. service is excellent, food is amazing and the place is well and neat. we ate outside the first time and the second time we ate inside. we were attended well (by tim) and we did enjoyed the visit. a must dinner location most specially to those who want an excellent atmosphere in the middle of a city center."

"this local favourite will fill up with finely dressed dutch men and women enjoying all the restuarant has to offer, any evening of the week! a grand cafe experience of the highest quality. they can back it up with awards! enjoy lunch, dinner, drinks, or dessert in a warm, and relaxed setting. as the dutch say gezelli "
"eating lunch, diner its always pleasure. the food is superb, service is qualified and the price is reasonable. and sitting on the bottom of the sea makes it spectacular"

"after a walk around the ring of castelijnseplas, it was a perfect stop for a drink or a meal. staffs are responsive, food is good and the price is surprisingly affordable."
"lunch was nice. nice concept with choosing multiple smaller dishes. nice food, friendly service, reasonable prices."
"varied and really delicious food and drinks, amazing and relaxing environment both indoor and outdoor on the beach, staff very nice! try the apple cake or the carrot cake."
we didn‚Äôt eat here but called in twice for drinks. first we listened to some excellent live music. we had already booked at an italian restaurant but called in again afterwards. the owner or manager made time to chat to us and if we had been in town longer we would have definitely eaten there. 
this place is smack in the center of emmeloord at the cinema and theatre corner. there are plenty of tables and chairs if to sit down outside if the weathers nice.
"this restaurants location is right at the corner. good spot. we were there for drinks and snack. reasonable price and food was okay. cozy atmosphere. there are plenty of outdoor seats, also indoor."
"very nice place for a snack , dinner and a drink, smack in the middle of emmeloord, you can sit here for hours and enjoy. as it can be windy on even the nicest summer day in the lange nering emmeloord you have to adjust to this fact and maybe sit inside, although sitting outside is more enjoyable, i recommend a glass of wine and some kind of share plate, love it."
"nice tapas restaurant, delicious food. they also have a nice combo (option) with the movies, which is right next to it."
"stopping at this nondescript restaurant in emmeloord for lunch one weekday in september was totally fortuitous. my group was on its way into the netherlands countryside from amsterdam. we pulled into town, parked in a large, crowded parking lot and began walking to where we understood a number of potential lunch spots were located. eindeloos certainly appeared plain from the outside, but since we were basically looking for sandwiches, it seemed ok, particularly because it was about the first place we came across. the interior is nothing special either, with the appearance of a recently closed nightclub re-worked into a restaurant. once we saw the menu, we began to get the picture this was something different. the food itself was totally eye-opening. soup of the day was pumpkin and crab and it was delicious, clearly using fresh ingredients. our wraps and sandwiches were also fresh and extremely good; the wraps and bread were fresh, as were the cut fruit and potatoes. even the tzatziki sauce that accompanied my gyro was homemade with fresh cucumbers. we were really surprised expecting basically a cafeteria and receiving really fresh and a well-made meals. the staff was pleasant and, admittedly, were somewhat challenged by some of our questions in english, but service was great, and everything was served just right. i had to stop and ask for a card from the staff before leaving to ensure i remembered the chef/owner, john van beek, and restaurant. the restaurant also had beer on tap and a bar; it appears to be a nice place for dinner as well, especially with the attention to details and daily specials with fresh ingredients. really a nice restaurant."
"enough choice, very wide range off products, all fresh  qaulity , all you can eat is so trough. recommend every body for having a good qaulity time at plaza a 6"
we had a family gathering and chose to have it at plaza 6. perfect for our group of 10 since they have an array of cuisine. they have food choices for gluten free and dairy free too! staffs are efficient and they are always ready to clear your table after a batch. they have a 2hours minimun for dining. it was a nice experience.
"couldnt thank the people at plaza 6 enough, i went with my boyfriend at the beginning of december and i was not disappointed! so much amazing quality food, wide choice of delicious desserts friendly staff and the stirfy chefs were so talented! will definitely be going back next time im in the netherlands! "
very friendly staff and fast service. great and tasty food at a correct price.  at a rather strange and hidden  location.
"it took us a while to find grieks, tucked away in emmeloord, but it was well worth the navigational challenge. our greeting was especially cordial both from the head waitress and the affable owner. immediately you step through the door after scaling the steep staircase and receive the authentically generous welcome, the delightful live greek music whisks you into mood for greek foo "
after we saw so many good comments we decided to join the #1s restaurant of emmeloord and to be honest we hadnt been disappointe 
"we loved our dinner at this greek restaurant. a hidden gem in a side street of the busy shopping street. the street is even called achterom, which translates into a street around the back. the staff was super friendly and put a smile on our faces and yummy food in our bellies. would revisit! the upstairs part does not require a lot of effort. there is an elevator if you dont wish to go on the (steep!) stairs."
"rodon brings the greek sun, hospitality and taste to emmeloord and are true to upscale casual dining."
"my friend invited me to go here for dinner. both of us order pasta, which are really good. we come here year ago, we feel it is maybe the best italian  restaurant here."
"beautiful old railway station rebuild in a beautiful restaurant. friendly staff, very good food, really a pleasant time to be!"
"super staff working here, they are so dedicated for making sure  guests love staying here. awesome starter, flammkuche and than the red fish, cooked to perfection. served with fried califlower and green beans. woow, just lovely."
"had lunch here with the family and i can say the food is of excellent quality. staff is very friendly and accurate. they have a selection of beers, we definitely go back soon."
"great welcome, superb accommodation and facilities. modern and very clean. excellent wifi. on site parking. on the edge of a cute little village near amsterdam, and near a rail station. the only downside was that the breakfast offerings were a bit meager for the price charged."
i‚Äôve stayed here a few time on business. it‚Äôs a small hotel in a lovely quiet location. staff are always accommodating and friendly. food is tasty.  rooms are large and bed is super comfortable.
"i stayed in hotel de witte dame one night (for business). the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. the rooms are very nicely decorated, silent and luxurious in a good w "
"but you leave with the worst impression because of the breakfast and the service....the ambience, the dinner, the rooms and the friendly reception staff promise a great stay. but wanting to leave early in the morning is a nightmare. breakfast starts at 8am, and even if you are in the breakfast room with your luggage packed and in a hurry to catch your plane, begging the waitress to at least get a coffee, you are left alone, without coffee or even water. repeating the wish for coffee at 8.02am, so in the official breakfast serving time, doesnt help. still no breakfast or coffee, but the explanation that she is alone and her colleague didnt show up. no apologies, no coffee, no nothing, just half an hour wait in an empty breakfast room, and no attempt whatsoever from the service to help with a croissant or a yoghurt. thank god they have coffee at schiphol. what a shame that we had to leave this wonderful place with anger and emptiness in our stomach just because of incompetent service!"
"super friendly staff, quick preparation, and yummy toppings.  they do delivery, takeaway, and (as we did) shared tables or window seats.  reasonable prices as well."
"we visited this restaurant twice within a stay of 3 days for dinner. the pizza is really nice and it almost feels like you‚Äôre in italy. the portions are big ! also, the place offers ice cream, which is really nice for a refreshments."
"certainly on a sunday night, this place was doing most of its business by telephone/delivery, but has a several eat-in tables right by the window overlooking the canal. the food was simple but plentiful and very tasty - and very reasonably priced. its nothing fancy but definitely a very pleasant place to eat in a nice location."
"great pizza take away, especially like bari, pesto en vulcano. rather quick delivery and still warm,"
best pizza in abcoude. not many places to eat in so its best to take out. its always busy there so better call in advance. they also deliver in the neighborhood.
"this is one i specifically asked tripadvisor to add, as it was an impressive enough meal to make note of. youll find porta e porta less than one block from the church in the main town square, and its pizza, salads, and even its desserts are worth tasting. excellent choice for inexpensive, good italian (at least dutch-style italian)."
"nice, cozy, freindly chinese restaurant with friendly staff and enough choise on the menu card to have a good time!"
"very cosy restaurant, super nice staff and lots of flowers. amazing great chinese food. fried dumplings, woow just lovely. pekingsuck with crispy skin is unbeatable. top quality of everything."
"the service was the best i got in all amsterdam , abcoude and areas they were just perfect and the food was delicious i recommended 100%.  good job!!‚ù§"
"perfect food, very pleasant staff! modern and convenient interior, tables and chairs. easy to find, next to the old church, in the center of the town."
"i visit here at least once a year when i am in the netherlands as the food is gorgeous, never been disappointed, the staff look after you so well and are friendly and helpful. this visit i had the beef strips with sesame and it was delicious. i will be back again for sure. abcoude is a beautiful town and you can watch the canal bridge being raised whilst sitting enjoying your meal."
this restaurant has a good name and i know people who go to this place from amsterdam for the food! its very centrally located. the staff is very very friendly! they also offer take out food. food has good flavors. we didnt had to wait too long for our food. we arrived a bit too late and were still eating when its was about closing time but the staff never gave you the feeling that you had to leave. our food was very good but it was too much. we couldnt finish it all which was bad as it was very good!
"i was delighted by all aspects of my dinner. although alone i had no difficulty booking a table on a very popular night. the staff who served me were invariably polite, spoke good english and were not phased by my requirement for gluten free food. the food was tasty and hot. the main course of duck stir fry was kept over a candle, so piping hot all through. there was no pressure to leave which sometimes happens when you are alone. all in all, a reasonably priced good meal."
"my town. very friendly, clean, great taste, if possible: no ve-tsin, no problem. when i go for take away i can eat two times."
modern chinese restaurant with real good flavors. i travel to china and hong kong 8 months a year and enjoy authentic foods. but this place has a great modern twist on some real basic staple foods in chi

"jasmyn is run be an owner who is from hong kong. the food they cook is great, the rijst tafel which is indonesian was great served with the dishes i expected. the satee tasted great, my wife who is from china enjoyed their food. overall nothing bad to say, the service was great and it offer some of the best asian food in the amsterdam are "
"try to visit here with my friend from abcoude once a year when i am in town, the service is excellent really friendly and helpful staff and most importantly the food is always excellent cooked to perfection. i nice atmosphere and in the summer you can sit outside as we did and watch the world go by in abcoude whilst enjoying your meal. well worth a visit."
instead of all the old fashioned chinese restaurants this one was redecorated a couple of years ago which attributes to a nice atmosphere. the food is nice (especially their specialties) and the people kind. make sure you make reservations for the weekend because its always crowded
having been a frequent visitor to hillegom for the last 26 years i finally decided to try to the food in this hotel. it was a good decision. the food was very good and the staff were polite and friendly. it provided a lovely atmosphere in which to dine with friends.
"i celebrated my 40 birthday here. was very well organized, enough beer, even cold. the food was excellent and enough. coming back for the next party!"
"hotel is handy located on a street with many shops and restaurants. our room was big and there were all neccessary facilities, nothing special though. breakfast was really good, allthough after nine some things were already eaten."
hotel is warm and inviting. makes you feel at home. wonderful restaurant and bar. mingle with the locals. they are friendly and give great advise as to were to go and what to s 
"great location, between zandvoort and noordwijk. hotel personal is very friendly. we stayed in a room at the second floor, in august, very very hot, no airco. no tea or coffee possibilities in the room.  diner is good."
"had lunch, and the food was great, and the location and staff were super nice. i love goat cheese salad, and the one they make is one of the best i ever had.  french fries are great, too."
this is without doubt the best place to dine in hillegom. the menu is superb and varied and the staff friendly and welcoming. special mention to elsa who makes wonderful irish coffees. so good in fact that more than one was consumed. highly recommend for an all round pleasant experience.
"dined here again on two occasions this week and both times the experience was superb. lovely food, very friendly and helpful staff and a lovely atmosphere. special thanks to the member of staff who looked after my glasses when i left them behind by mistake. i collected them the next morning along with a personal note. very happy customer. they also make great irish coffees."
"dined here recently for the first time and will definitely go back when im next in hillegom.  friendly staff, great food and sumptuous decor all added up to a very pleasant dinning experience."
"i visited late at night with my husband and although the kitchen had just closed they still let us order. we ate a full three courses and we were made to feel very welcome given the time of night it was. the food was very tasty and presented very well. should i return to the area i would definitely return, hopefully a little earlier :) "
"great food, style and service. those young people give it all and what they don`t know yet they learn fast. enjoyable kitchen and venue, terrazza, blazing fire inside and nice corners on the 1. floor."
"went there after a long bike ride in the tulip fields. had excellent food - and they had nice local beers and my favourite trappist brand. fast, genuine service."
pleasant surprise. food and presentation were very well done. had the prime rib with wine sauce..highly recommend place and dish. a little pricey but well worth it. staff courteous and tried very hard to make it a good experience
great dishes and great people who work there - i enjoyed it very much ^^ everything was fresh and tasty - nice decor and music ;)
"we had an excellent dinner at this place, food was great, but service and attention from waiters does need improvement. had to ask for refill on drinks, clearing the table after a course was done, and so on. pity. but again, food is great and ambiance also!! a place to go back to!!"
we both had the sate. it was exactly as a good sate should be ! will definitely go back to try the other dishes.
"after a long day we were looking for pub grub but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at het alternatif, all perfectly cooked and presented, comfort food with a difference. also great attentive service. well worth a visit."
"due to the different levels it might be a challenge to dine here with big groups but with a small group it is perfect. good food, good wine."
i went here with friends for diner. we all had a menu and all three courses were deliciou 
"this place was recommended by a friend, so we had dinner here the other night. it is in the centre of hillegom and there is parking behind. we went on a nice summer evening and the terrace was well occupied, but we decided to eat inside as you are allowed to smoke outside in the netherlands! the menu is not very large but it has good choices! all our meals were excellent and nicely presented. the staff was very friendly and efficient!

"we stumbled upon this restaurant on a trip in early may and had a great lunch.  we liked it so much, we returned for dinner later in the week when we were nearby.  it was another delicious meal.  service was excellent, as well."

we visited this restaurant with about 20 people. the groupe was well seperated from the rest of the restaurant. the fact that are three different levels in this place makes it all very cosy. on top of this the food was nice and the service very friendly.

this is a lovely place to celebrate something with friends or family. it is a more modern and personalised version which really is following to the tradition. modern atmosphere with lovely staff. it can be busy so booking is required most days of the week.

"we went there again with the family to experience the seray treatment again. we were there before and had a splendit evening in this tiny little cosy restaurant. we were welcomed very amicamidly and stated accordingly. then the matter of teh house came to our table to explain the menu and to recommend the wiens for that evening. then the warm bath started. one delicious dish after the other arrived at our dish, and it kept on going. a real delicious evening treat. very recommendable."
"after a fully enjoyable and colourful visit at keukenhofs tulip wonderland, we were starving for some authentic indonesian food. enter seray bistroriental:-) we followed the reviews of fellow travellers and foodies and we were not disappointed...we went in soon after opening with the staff (eating their early dinner to prepare for the evening) warmly welcoming us. the head chef and owner, raymond, brought the menus and explained a bit the history and philosophy of the restaurant. we ordered one of the restaurant specialties but we werent prepared for that: an extensive culinary trip to indonesias best...three hours later (yes, three hours later but hey a greek and a spaniard can talk...) we left thinking this was a restaurant worth writing home about! thank you to the chef and team! pity the nearby vintage ford museum is now closed...but hopefully see you next year after keukenhof!"
"the service was very personal, in time and friendly. the temperature of the red merlot was a bit too cold. the food was excellent and we will surely repeat the visit. the only minor thing was the cooking smell on our clothes, when leaving the restaurant. the air suction was not functioning correctly."
everytime i come to holland it is becoming a family tradition to visit seray.  the food and service is excellent and well worth the trip.    ton kiphardt
we love the rijsttafel dishes. this restaurant is nice with great food. staff super nice. the interior is very nice. many dishes especially sate was very tasty.
"the meal was excellent; the drinks served on the right temperature, the service in time and very friendly."
"we went here for the second time, and again we were surprised by the good food and service. this on top of our favourite restaurants. the experience of the food was again mouth watering."
we enjoyed our meal at seray bistro. we bought the full meals and they did not disappoint. it felt like we were able to sample dozens of items off the menu which turned out to be an amazing meal! we loved it! service was fast and friendly. i appreciated the waitress taking our coats and ensuring she greeted us as we left. the food was so good and it felt healthy. nothing fried or over done. nicely seasoned and wonderful tasting! i love it all!
we were with 5 guests and all of us enjoyed the food. four of us has the tante elly rice table and one had the nasi ramas. lovely and very tasteful. will definitely be back.
"you have to really look for the restaurant otherwise you wont be able find it. once you do find it, you know youre in for a treat. i ordered the nasi goreng along with 4 other small dishes (2 meat + 2 veggies). its a lot for 1 person so come hungry. the dishes were well prepared and tasty. the service is great as well. id definitely come again."
we were at seray with a group of 4 adults and 2 children. we had several different dishes and they were all very good and tasty. even the kids liked it. we got lots of extras so there was plenty of food! the young lady that served was very friendly even though she was on her own and very bus

"small (max 40people) indonesian restaurant. when you go there, you must taste the indonesian rice table tante elly. this is an outstanding dish."
"wonderful restaurant, good dining. the food is according to familiy tradition and reci "
"i was told this restaurant in the little village of hillegom was a household name for the devotees of the indonesian cuisine. personally, ive found most of the indonesian food so-so; too often way too salty and too often showered with flavour enhancer "
"i love indonesian food and am quite experienced, both cooking and eating. i checked tripadvisor for a restaurant near haarlem and this one popped up. book a table and had their rice tabl "
it is located in the old hillegom post office. cute place. good for families. the service is friendly and the pancakes are good. at times they have groups. we had the traditional dutch pancakes (cheese and bacon) as a test. all good !!
"we were biking from haarlem to lisse on our first vacation to holland, and stopped here for a quick lunch and break from all the pedaling. what a delight! veis was very patient with us (we are typical americans so our dutch was basically non-existent). she recommended her favorite pancakes and a fantastic local beer which was refreshing and totally perked us up for the rest of our day! we rested, enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, savored the food, and to top it all off, my husband collects glasses, so when he asked to purchase one of the specialty beer glasses for the blauwe tram triple we enjoyed, the manager gifted us a one! o.o truly generous and far more than our relatively inexpensive meal warranted. the hospitality was the highlight of our day, and helped make our whole trip magical. this was by far the nicest stop we made and well happily trek across the globe to come back some day!"
we go here for coffee and lunch. in the summer you can sit outside. the staff is friendly and the place it well suited for kids 
"this is a lovely little kid friendly restaurant. all of our food was fabulously made, fresh and delicious. we were very happy with our dutch pancakes but also the cheeses and salads. the were terrific with our children, too. its located in a cute little town! highly recommend!"
"great ice cream. very busy place in the weekends, but more than enough staff to make the line go fast. do visit if you get the chance!"
"out favoriete icecream parkour. always about 30 different flavours. good and tastefull icecream, freshly made each day and at very reasonable prices."
".... even if you are spoiled by true italian icecream this spot is worthwhile visiting. and their motto is true, never take only one scoop. today it was tiramisu amongst others. great !"
"no doubt that this place knows how to make the best ice cream and frequently updates its assortment with great new tastes. seating becomes a bit problematic on top dates given the amount of traffic. (outside waiting lines are not unusual). there is, however, more than enough qualified staff thus the waiting never becomes unpalatable."
"since many years the place t go for very nice ice cream. with alway super quality. also for a very reasonable price! take care many times there is a waiting line, because it is well known"
definitely best ice place in the area. always friendly staff. good quality product. never been disappointed.
"i used to go to de hoop when i was a child, 30 years ago. they still exist and are still delicious ! they have earned several prices and they deserve it. a must to try in blaricum!"
"best ice cream weve had in years, with an incredible range of flavours. despite a long queue, the weather was very good that evening, the staff move fast and are friendly and accomodating."
"this is the best ice cream in netherlands, perhaps the world. yes, there is gelati in italy, but that is a different set of ingredients (mainly ice and milk and natural non-artificial flavours. dutch ice cream is pure raw milk made with flavours. in most places you get artificial flavours and low quality milk. the price can run from euros 3-5 for one or two scoops. at de hoop, you can savour the flavours while standing in line for ten-fifteen minutes and build up an appetite. when you finally get insie, five cheerful young dutch school children (and occasionally the owners) serve you with the speed of a new york city fast food chef. you pile away a kilo of ice cream for euros 8.50 or individual cones with one or two scoops for just euro 1.50 or 2.5 for two. thats half price to the garbage they serve in most ice cream salons worldwide. only the moonlight inn at victoria beach, manitoba on lake winnipeg in canada can beat that. supplied with dutch quality ice cream, the line ups can be longer on a warm sunny day, but the cost and quality are unbeatable."
"in the middle of blaricum is this amazingly nice ice-cream shop. made by the owner herself, fresh, great taste and against reasonable prices. even if it rains worthwhile the visit."
"this small but cosy place used to be a milk factory, but now it is a ijssalon, where you may sit down to have a real treat in a coupe, with cream and chocolate, or go to have a hand treat ijsje. you may sit down at a small table, choose a spoon to handle the ice-cream, or eat it out of a cup or beker. they close down for the winter."
if you like ice cream this is the place to get a cone! all home made ice creams absolutely the best! friendly prices as well worth the wait!
at this iceparlor you will be able to get a very high quality of icecream giving you the idea of visiting a parlor in rome. perfect flavours combined with high service. personal takes extra care if they hear a request that might indicate an intollarance or allergy (and they actually do know the difference between the two). also the ratio between price and quality is very good.
"the variety of icecreams is crazy. its fresh and a lot of choice. ive been there ¬± 50+ times, but i recently went somewhere else and that made me aware that im spoiled with the quality. its even fun and nice to be in a queue. friendly staff and great ice"
during years over years this salon has the best icecream of holland. winners of several prices! go over there is a must and enjoy
"nice ice cream store, good service, nice selection of flavors. a bit cheaper than in rotterdam. worth visiting"
"it is not a restaurant, but an icecream sh "
one of the place to get good quality ice-cream.texture of the ice- cream is nice and creamy and full of flavour. lots of flavours to choose from and price wise is good.
"great place to eat, drink and relax. perfect for a little getaway with kids, they can enjoy in and out playing."
it is a very nice and cosy place. it is also great that there is indoor and outdoor play area for all ages of kids. food is also good. you can enjoy you day with your friends while your kids are playing ;)
"indoor and outdoor fun for childeren. a perfect lunch menu, a not unexperienced staff but not disturbing."
perfect for a visit with (small)  children. very nice play area inside and outside.  simple but honest lunch dishes. we will definitely return.
"tasty food, excellent service. better than the last time we were here, for sure. make sure you book at table, especially when the suns shining, because its really busy!"
great place and location with unique view on the moorland and forest. next to the sheeps ‚Äúhome‚Äù. good parking
"lovely location, great venue and delicious food!  very friendly staff who fulfilled all our wishes. very nice if you have a bigger group coming. i would recommend it for sure!"
another beautiful summer day in netherlands and sitting outside for a drink and de tafelberg is a great place. enjoy the sun! service could be better...
one of our favorite spots is this restaurant with large outside terrace ‚òÄÔ∏è next to the blaricumse heath (in summer time you will sheep everywhere  
was introduced by friends to this lively little place. good parking facilities and a fantastic welcome. plenty of staff and great menu choice. overall very good service and the quality of the food is amazing. pricing maybe for some people slightly above average but i think it‚Äôs definitely worth i 
"pleasant restaurant on the moorland. good-sized terrace. food was decent, but nothing outstanding. reasonable prices for this part of the netherlands. service was a little slow, but they were rather busy. excellent location for taking a walk on the moors."
always very busy. service can take some time. value for money is ok. location is great. nice for a lunch and / or dinner
the restaurant is beautifully located and a great place to have lunch after a long walk. food is very good. in summer time they have a great terrace. dogs are allowed in the restaurant.
a very nice restaurant and terrace with excellent food! the restaurant is situated in the nature surrounded by fields with the occasional sheep strutting along. a great place for children to run and play. a great terrace for enjoying a cup of coffee or a glass of wine!
one of the nices places to have lunch or coffee after a walk on the heather fields in blaricum . lovely terras with well prepared lunch meals and great desserts . a place to be recommended
"the location is prepared for (little) childeren. the personnel also think about the little ones. the lunch was great, tasteful and more than enou "
"this restaurant is very popular during the day in the weekends with visitors who come for a walk in the nature reserve and the sheep shed nearby, and in the evening the locals take over. at lunch during the week you will often find some business people too. the menu is relatively simple but affordable. food is decent for the price, especially in this region. service varies a bit, they can get overloaded at busy times. they have a limited wine card but all choices are honest and drinkable wines. weekday during lunch and evenings there is usually enough free parking too. lunchtime in a sunny weekend - prepare to be forced to park at quite distance! their web based reservation system works well, so you wont go up there for naught."
"we had a nice walk to get to tafelberg and once we arrived on a misty afternoon, it was a welcome sight...bustling with adults, kids and dogs. the atmosphere was casual and welcoming...the service a little less welcoming-it waivered between rushed and non-existent, the menu was somewhat eclectic and the food was good...not great. but still we had a lovely time and i would recommend it for a quick bite-reservations seem essential. i would imagine in the summer months the outdoor dining is excellent. keep in mind my very good rating is mostly due to the beautiful setting."
"reservations recommended, especially for a saturday night. it was bustling with both small and large groups. food outstanding: carpaccio of smoked duck breast, tomato soup with a big dollop of cream, succulent veal. all with efficient and friendly service."
it does not matter if its breakfast lunch or dinner the atmosphere here is always very good and the walks fabulo 
problem with the tafelberg is that it is always full (especially outside) when its nice weather. so yesterday evening was a pleasant surpri 
"the perfect place dor coffee,tea, lunch, drinks or dinner after a nice walk in the country side! friendly staff good food! country side is worth a visit combined with relaxing in tafelberg"
we had a family dinner here. they have an extensive menu which is nice. food was good. service was a bit slow. we ordered some bread which they brought together with the main course which is too bad. my daughter was going to get french fries with her main course and this also arrived 10 minutes lat 
i had lunch here with some colleagues. the service was decent and tafelberg seizoensproeverij wild (game meat tasting platter) that i had was really nice! the platter was nicely prepared and well seasoned. i would recommend giving it a t 
"we live close to the tafelberg and walk our dogs in the surrounding every day. so that means we visit here for a coffee almost everyday, and sometimes lunch. the location and terrace area is superb. the drinks and food are consistently great value for money and good quality. the staff are always friendly and helpfu "
"situated next to a heath, a tranquil relaxing place with excellent food, the service was slighly slow but pleasant and friendly, the food was filling and very reasonably priced,"
"great place to spend a whole sunday afternoon.after a satisfying lunch bring the dog and take a stroll on the nearby heatherarea, and come back for coffee. the menu card is versatile and the wine list does not break your ba "
"the location is great, with a view over the moorlands. its easy to reach with ample parking. the staff is friendly, but not warm. the food is tasty but not delicious. we tend to use this place for quick lunch meetings or a coffee, but not for a great dinner out. "
a cosy restaurant and hotel.  the food is good.  had a soup and hamburger.  both tasted good and prepared well.
after a very friendly reception we were well taken care of in a pleasant and informal setting. we could choose from a good variety of dishes. the food was well-prepared and of high quality.
"a lovely evening meal for the family. great waiting staff who were very pleasant, along with excellent food for us and our young children."
"blaricum is one of the poshest places in the netherlands. so, one could expect an attitude, yet not in bellevue. ive been a couple of times for a coffee or a nice meal. the atmosphere is relaxed, staff very helpful, food good and nicely priced."
"this is located in the beautiful village of blaricum, with its old farm houses, and is a great spot for a nice family lunch or dinner. food is very good, and consistent, service friendly, and they have great sandwiches, salads and entrees. we eat there often, when in the netherlands, and i redcommend it."
"we found zon en zand while looking for a new place to eat near the beach villas. my husband, adult daughter and i were the only customers on a monday evening in early february. they pulled out all the stops for us. they were featuring a beer from texel island which was delicious and gave us some free glasses to take home. we were interested in fish so they made us a wonderful platter of three fishes and some shrimp, vegetables and potats. all wonderful. complimentary limoncello to top it off. it was a feast. we were delighted in every way and would recommend it highly. the atmosphere was very warm and elegant on a bitter cold night. the service and food quality were wonderful."
i absolutely loved it there.  we had lunch and then came back for diner. both were absolutely amazing! i will certainly come back here.
"we whent with the familie to eat today, kids where happy with their nuggets and me and my wife had a lovely pasta , a carbonara and i had the aglio , one of the best ive ever taste "
this beach bar has a bit more of fancy feel than most others in hoek van holland. the food is good as well and the staff is friendly.
"this restaurant is a place where food and drinks are served perfectly to customers. grilled half chicken and cold beer, thats what i ordered here and everything was tasteful.üçó"
"perfect food, nice and friendly people and the place is realy clean. nacho‚Äôs where outstanding with corona and sunshine"
"we stopped for pre-dinner drinks.  it was quite busy but service was unduly slow.  friendly and welcoming.  nice place to spend an hour or two, on the beach"
weve been here for a number of times and every time it was a great experien

"lovely little place to relax by the beach. plenty of choice regarding where to sit, lots of shaded areas and sun spots to suit everyone. restaurant inside is lovely and cool really airy and nice atmosphere. would like to come back with friends for cocktails on the beach someti "
"we visited this restaurant based on the good reviews, and we were pleasantly surpris "
"perfect spare ribs, delicius zeebraas, fresh prawns ever and a friendly man who nows the best of all"
"a very nice beach bar that serves excellent food, probably the best restaurant of all the beach bars at hoek van holland."
korean chicken sandwich- nicely prepared. chicken not deep fried and therefore feels healthy too.   chicken burger - chicken balls deep fried as patties in between the buns and very tasty   coffees are full of options.   pastries. try the stroopwaffle cheesecake. a nice combination.
a bit pricey but as expected for a beachfront restaurant. nice staff and friendly service. the food was worth the money and service was fast enough. the kid enjoyed the activities nearby.
"good food, best we had on the hoek beach. friendly staff, nice restaurant. a bit pricy but not more than you‚Äôd expect for a place on the beach."
"we were at the beach and got hungry. we passed it the first time and it looked very nice and cozy. after passing all restaurants we went back and didn‚Äòt regret it. the restaurant hast such a nice atmosphere, the food was great and the price was ok."
"really close to the ferry terminal. we needed to eat somewhere as we had arrived early. the food was tasty, quickly served and good value. thoroughly recommend here"
"we went for a bit to eat before getting onto he ferry to the uk. service very good, quick, although not rushed. the food was plentiful and of high standard. thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
"ordered the indonesian ricetaffel and what a huge portion, there must have been enough for three even it was just me. the taste was great and service excellent and the price was very reasonable. highly recommendable"
"had the indonesian set menu, with a selection of meat and veggies in various sauces.  nice atmosphere and good service. the fried banana desert was so good piping hot when it came, i had some straight away,"
"after four weeks of fantastic food in scandinavia we were waiting for a ferry to the uk and discovered this gem. the owner served us very quickly and with humor, the food was terrific, just what we needed."
"we stopped here on the way to the ferry. we had a few hours to wait and decided to try the food. the staff were very welcoming, especially as we were a group of bikers who had been camping and on the road all day. the menu is huge, such and amazing choice of dishes. i had the chicken in a szechuan sauce with fried rice. my mate had the usual standby sweet and sour chicken. mine was amazing and the portions were huge. i tried his chicken balls and ill tell you what they didnt come from iceland best batter ive ever tasted and the sauce was to died for. the staff could not do enough for us. loved this place. also the menu is in english if you look closely at the small print."
"the best thing about this indonesian. chinese restaurant is that the staff also have their meals there, shows that they are happy to eat along with customers. food is of generous portions, and well cooked. loads of choice with a really good atmosphere"
i was happy to find that ocean city is still as good as 10 years ago. plenty of choice for a reasonable price. and even on a monday evening still busy enough
"for years the best chinese restaurant nearby. with kantonese specialties like teak-pan. but also a good choice for take away. not very cheap, not too expensive. nice service from chinese, but all dutch (born) speaking personel."
we use this restaurant regularly before we get on the ferry to england. the service is very friendly and quick. the menu has a great choice and everything we have ordered has been tasty and fresh. there is a childrens menu and lovely ice cream desserts for th 
so we decided to visit the 2 seasons aga 
"we were here in june, the staff is really friendly. it is on the beach with an really big inside sitting area wit the kitchen and a bar, and a pretty big outside area where you sit on the beach. there little fireplaces on the terrace and inside, inside there places with couches where you can just sit and relax with the fireplaces and enjoy the sunset over the beach. theyre dogfriendly, and have drinks and snacks for dogs. the staff is really friendly and interested in their customers. the food was good and the atmosphere was relaxing. "
"it was not busy. it was sunny but windy so we decided to sit inside. nice atmosphere. the food was good, generous portion and the services were above average."
we decided spontaneously to go out for dinner and chose the 2seasons for its dinner buff 
"we were lucky to choose this one as its along a very temptomg stretch of pubs cum restaurants along the beach. in april during weekdays there were not many people. despite that, service and food was great. we can recommend the burger and the chicken sandwich on wholemeal bread (the dutch version has something to do with a forest i recall). the portions were much bigger than we thought (and exactly like we wished for ;-)) and the taste was great."
plus: delicious and well presented food. very nice staff. outside seating at the beach. minus: a bit longer waiting time for the food but overall it was wort the time!  very nice place to eat.
"we started to wonder if wed chosen the right place to eat, since the restaurants to either side were packed, and this one was nearly empty, but we were quite happy with our meal "
"last week my family and i visited 2seasons. wed never heard of a live cooking diner, but the waiter explained everythin "
"we visited this lounge like restaurant just after boxing day, with three children and four adul "
2 seasons is the best spot to go on the beach! always a lot of fun had at this place! perfect to have some drinks and dinner with friends and watch the sun go down! would recommend this place to everyone!!
"been here last week to have the live cooking dinner... what a suprise everything whas really nice and we enjoyed our time here.(especially the large chocolate fountain) very pleasant staff, nice atmosfere, and very co "
"its what you want when sitting at a terrace, no pressure, enjoy life and have a drink and bite. enjoy the view and people. very polite staff. price/quality in balance. big portions of food. dont eat all the bread befor your dinner starts, it will fill you."
"a restaurant with friendly stuff, great atmosphere, a place to have your normal dinner in a reasonable price with great beer!!!"
"friendly staff welcomed us to the terrace. 2 tables could be merged into 1 when we explained our group of 5 was a household. good food and great atmosphere. if im in the neighborhood again and looking for a restaurant, this would be my preferred choice. "
"we stopped here for a quick bite before taking the boat on the meuse. centraal is situated on baarlo‚Äôs main square, baarlo itself being a beautiful little town full of historic houses and a magnificent castle. at centraal my wife had a toasted sandwich which i wish i had chosen, it was simply beautiful, the highlight being the exquisite bread which i‚Äôm told is baked on the premises. superbly crunchy on the outside, a soft, near sponge like pale yellow interior, seriously nearly the best bread i‚Äôve ever eaten. my croquettes were good, again on this great bread, but the toasted sandwich, with smoked ham and local cheese oozing from its every orifice, was another level.!"
"this lovely gastro-pub in the center of baarlo is a nice surprise. the quality of the food is very good, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere quiet enough for good conversation. a great place for a small group dinner if youre visiting the area around venlo."
overall we all had a great experience he 
"i enjoyed an excellent meal with the european business team here this past week. the menu was surprisingly varied, although i think the local choices are always best. i had some roasted venison and it was delicious. oh, and it is a pub so the beer was great!"
"great atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. good range of beer and fantastic hamburger! our visit to baarlo wouldn‚Äôt have been as enjoyable or memorable if we hadn‚Äôt discovered centraal."
we parked our cars near this cafe/restaurant before setting off on a cycle trip. officially the establishment opened at 11am but they let us in at 10am for coffee. at the end of the day we returned for a very tasty meal.
"the location is worth a visit by itself, an amazing array of different gardens in the wild style of the 20th century dutch wave. the chef , alwin leemhuis, is cooking with organic ingredients from the garden and other local sources. the results are pure and very refined. friendly and kowledgable service offering exellent wine pairings. only open in summer weekends and very much worth a detour!"
"lots of choice in the menu, i like the pancakes thicker though like they were in the past. deserts were great!"
"we had lunch on the terrace while visiting this beautiful village! the concept is very nice, large choice and reasonable prices, a good experience!"
"above our table were balloons and a nice sign with happy birthday, so a warm welcome. pancakes (they have a lot of choices) tasted very good. desserts are original and delicious. when your kid is a member of the kidsclub, he/she gets coins to trade in for a present from the restaurant shop. want to have a nice time and good pancakes, this is the place to go!"
"we had a really great lunch here. had an italian pancake (like pizza, but not so heavy) and one with apple and xinnon as dessert.. i recommend this place to anyone. service is kind and fast. 5 stars"
"this restaurant as well as the town is not on the usual tourist map. it definitely is not on the indian tourist map. we discovered this place as our friends are the residents of the local village, hence this outi "
"i went to this restaurant twice because the pancakes there are incredible. i had the best pineapple and meat pancake ive tasted in the netherlands. the place is really quaint and cozy, and the menu comes in english if you need it. they make many different kinds of pancakes that are not sweet like in the u.s. but can be purchased if you want one. i dont know what the pancake was made from but it was the size of dinner plate. they have a small restroom down in the basement but you need to be able to walk down stairs to get to it."
"chose this restaurant when visiting with family. city centre ambiance. enormous selection of pancakes- fruit topped, pizza and so many others."
"we had a coffee break on the terrace.  the service was fast and friendly, the coffee was good as was the apple cake"
the range of different pancakes is enormous. of course we did not try all of them but the ones we tried were perfectly baked with nice ingredients.
strolled around heusden. so pretty especially around harbou 
i was there a couple of times. its always full located in the main square . wide range to choose from in the menu. the pancakes are delicious!
"we were tired but wanted a light lunch and pancakes seemed a perfect solution. i had bacon, raisins and apple,a combination which really worked. service was fine and coffee delicious"
they say who says bergen says de taverne. this place has been the centre of almost every cultural and especially musical outings. the atmosphere is so relaxed and happening. people of literally all ages walk in and mingle and enjoy each others company. the food thats being served is really tasty and original. it would be a shame if this place would dissapear for some reason. like it a lot! go there!
"we came to this cafe for the live music of matt woods our friends from knoxville. the band should perform at 9.00 pm but finally it was at 10.00 pm. the cafe offers drink and food for reasonable price but they had only one menu though its changed daily. as the cafe is not really big so its getting crowded as soon as the band played and it was really full house when it rain outside. nice folks and place. one minus point was the strong cigarette smoke from outside got inside, too"
"nice atmosphere. even my 8-year old daughter loved it, especially the duck breast, which was the plate of the day. i would come back any time and recommend it."
"we celebrated a family reunion of seven and were seated at the central large table for dinner. the restaurant has one fixed dish that changes daily. this time it consisted kabeljouw and stamppot (cod and a pur√©e with vegetables), a very tasty typical dutch fare.the vegetarian plate was a combination of tempura vegetables with the same ‚Äústamp pot‚Äù, which was well received by the three vegetarians. there was a large wine and tap beer selection. this is a great place for a reasonably priced meal in a very cozy setting in the heart of town."
"wonderful music and a lovely bar. definitely worth visiting. they have a enormous range of beverages, from single malt whiskeys to the darkest beers. and last but not least.. the staff is incredibly helpful and ive never seen them without a smile."
"nice place, often hosts live music. some big ones passes the review, among whom even joe cocker and other mayor artists."
"we were a bit skeptical, the prices were quite high. but the food quality was very good and in combination with the location worth every cent."
"we were looking for a place to visit the beach which was not too distant from the car park and found this hidden gem we never visited before. the beach is close to the paved access road and an interesting double array of dunes with a inner lake just behind the first row of dunes. this is well suited for kite surfing. on the other side is the beach bar & restaurant luctor & emergo and this is a classic beach joint which holland is so famous for. the place is large, both inside and outside with plenty of seats behind the glass walls to keep the sea breeze out. the place lends itself for sunbathing but even more for having drinks and/or lunch. there are enough servants to help you rapidly and the menu has lots of choice with text in dutch and german. dogs are allowed but must be kept on the leech and the high situated terrace is quite suitable to keep and eye on the kite surfers at sea. a great find and we surely will come again here."
strandtenten or beach restaurants - one of those great institutions in the netherlands. they are literally build on the beach designed to make the most of the views and the weath 
"delicious cake also vegan, good coffee and very friendly, polite service stuffüòÉ thank you very muchüòä"
"lovely wee restaurant with superb cook preparing great breakfasts, cakes, lunches, afternoon teas and snacks. excellent coffee, but also licensed, so wine etc on hand. friendly staff and nice setting. sit outside for people watching."
we appreciated the recommendations of sushi and we were very satisfied with the lobster and the black angus. even the bread and dips was very good
"together with my youngest brother and his wife , we had an amazing experience here. excellent service  excellent food  excellent wines the atmosphere is almost unique!"
"we went to this restaurant for my birthday meal. the owner was so welcoming and made the experience so special. we had the three course menu, the food was faultless. we also had the wine pairing with each meal (the best chardonnay i‚Äôve ever had!!). a cozy restaurant hidden away in bergen with a friendly atmosphere. if you find yourself in bergen this restaurant is a must visit!"
"absolutely incredible restaurant, we came for a family birthday meal and the host couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly. the food was so delicious, with exquisite wine pairings throughout the meal. hidden away in the charming town of bergen this is a must-visit restaurant we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here."
"we had a great dinner at ‚Äöware jakob‚Äò - food was excellent and wine pairing a nice fit. owner is a charming, talkative guy who creates a very welcoming atmosphere‚Ä¶ definitely a recommendation!"
due to covid restrictions only lunch could be seeved. but it was  delicious . great service. a bit hidden but definetly worthwhile  visiting.
"this place is absolutely worth going to. very young team in the kitchen, but they really know their job well. the owner who will help you chose and serves as well could be an actor , he is fun and nice to have around . food was great , a place we will be visiting again"
this is the second time we had dinner here. we always get a lovely welcome from the owner of the place who also work the 
"i ate here with friends and had a fabulous time. the staff are truly excellent, making you feel like an old friend. i could not fault the service. and the food, with matching wines was stunning and delicious. a wonderful, tasty and relaxed evening!"
yet another good restaurant in bergen. this one a little out of the way but well worth the visit. food is very good and the staff is very nice.
"if you feel like a real nice dinner, take your time and go to the ware jacob.  since im a vegetarian its always a surprise what you get, but its always good. nice wines and friendly staff."
"relaxed atmosphere, great cooking. not very posh, just right for an excellent evening out. let them advise you on what they would recommend, both in food and wine. youll love it!"
"small menu, but you can have it anyway you want it. the food is, untypically by dutch standards, refined and the portions copious. good wines at reasonable prices and great service. the owners and staff are very friendly, not an obvious characteristic in holland..."
"very tasty chinees food. luxury fish dishes (oyster, large shrimp, etc) and of course also beef and chicken. all served with a variety of spices and vegetables. we choose twice for the  surprise menu and where both time pleasantly surprised by the (off-menu) choices. very friendly service. "
as always this restaurant was great. the food is special and tasty.  the service is very good.  try the tie pan with chicken and teriyaki sauce
we had an excellent diner and excellent service. the atmosphere is very modern and unlike most chinese restaurants. try the fresh coconut icecream.
"it doesnt look like a chinese restaurant in the first sight. no red colour, no lantern, no chinese letters, just white building with dutch letters. the interior is quite modern, sleek style, white chairs, here and there some buddha statues or paintings on the wall. but when you look at the menu card, they have a lot of chinese cuisine. and also the staff are in black and very friendly. they listened to what the guest want and made it for you. the food was delicious. good service and quick served."
"the chinese food was excellent and very tasty. especially the tipan with beef.  the restaurant looks very modern, clean and has chinese influences.  the service was friendly but very chaotic and rushed and they looked understaffed. but the food and friendliness made it all good."
"seemed a little posh for is when we walked in, but tastefully s "
"this rather expensive restaurant, serves good quality oriental food with a twist. its different then your local chinese take away. the staff is very friendly and helpful!"
"always very good service,friendly and caring.the food is good and the prices are really okay compare to other restaurants in this village. we went there several times and we always have a ood evening there.thanks!"
"duinvermaak is a relaxed place focusing on pizza and pancakes. for the latter they have many choices, and i liked the one with bacon and apples. service was friendly and efficient."
"this is an ideal restaurant for eating lunch, dinner or just for a drink after walking in the beautiful woods around bergen and schoorl. it also has a terrace area outside (great in the afternoon sun) and has a free car park just opposite (which can get quite busy in the weekend "
"this place does two things and they do them really well - pancakes of every type and description and pizzas. we had a combination and everyone was happy with their choice. service ok, albeit a bit harried as the place was packed to the seams."
"various members of our family have been visiting this establishment for a number of years. the restaurant is a lovely old building, in a nice setting. there is an excellent choice of pancakes, especially so for my vegetarian wife. the place was totally buzzing with activity, but the staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly and considering how busy it was the service was of a high standard. next time we are in holland we will be back!"
"crepe with ü•ì, üßÄ and üçÑ ! add a üç∫ and a ‚òïÔ∏è.  friendly and efficient staff, many folks brought their dogs into eatery.  great spot."
"have enjoyed quite a few meals at this bar/restaurant i usually go with one of their capriosca pizzas and the bases always impress me, nice, crispy yet doughy consistency, a good range of drinks, friendly staff, good location for after a mountain bike ride in the labyrinth of tracks and trails in the nearby duins. also great for young families and offers a playground for children to run around in with outside al la carte seating. charming old building with a lot of local bergen histo "
great diner and very nice service  
"thanks to a great recommendation from my nephew we have enjoyed a great lunch here.  awesome kids area and great pancakes.  very relaxing, good service and a picturesque location amongst trees.  well worth a diversion for the tourist."
take all my visitors here for the best pancakes in north holland. as a family we have also been. service is good. staff friendly
"located at the foot of the bergen-schoorl dunes this restaurant serves very good food at reasonable prices. it is a family favorite especially when the kids are hungry for pizza or pancakes. hey, there is even a playground for the youngsters."
"i visitedd this place few times with my husband and it was busy all the time! the people like it, the people come back again and i dont blame them. we will too! the food is all time fresh and ready to be enjoyed in a short time even when theres no time to breathe for the staff. the pizzas are wonderful and the pancakes afterwards are heavy to handle, but a must! with wonderful architecture and interior of the place, the experience is just delicious!"
"when i lived in the area some 25 years ago, we frequently used to come here for their famous pancakes. they still did not disappoint and i was also pleasantly surprised by the (to me) new look of the place. looking forward to coming again!!!"
typical family restaurant with very reasonable prices and a large selection of pizzas and pancakes.
"pizzas, pancakes and other stuff. my family and i really enjoy their food and wonderful atmosphere. great food at reasonable prices. we go here several times per year."
"this is such a nice restaurant, very relaxed, for all agegroups young or old. they are the top when it comes to pancakes, pizzas, icecream, soup, cake. coffee, tea e "
this is definitely a family restaurant with children and dogs welcome. there is a childrens playground and a bowl of water for dogs. the pancakes are good with lots of choices; they are very thin by n. american standards but that is what makes them so good; pizzas are fine and also thin. a pizza/pancake per person is usually the norm. they have recently rebuilt; although the restaurant is roomier it has become much noisier. it is very busy in the summer/weekends. reserve ahead of time if possible. prices are quite reasonable.
we come here regularly and besides good pancakes can recommend their pizzas good place for a very quick meal
"very special pizza combinations, but i love them...still do...pancakes are very jummy as well....this place is absolutely worth visiting..very affordable and just good quality of food...."
"this is one of our favourite restaurants, a place where we go quite regular "
good simple food. well priced. staff friendly. great location by park entrance. perfect place for post cycle visit.
"what a wonderful way to finish a long day cycling ,completely off road on trails through the wonderful dune national pa "
"you know the dutch pancakes ? you can have them here. great quality! furthermore pizzas, until 5.00 pm also poffertjes are available ... breadrolls, salads, etc. the forests/dune-area starts just across the street, and it is a bit on the border of bergen, hence a bit on the quieter side compared to the core of bergen. nice building as well, of course you can bring your dog or kid, playground outside."
one of us has a lengthy list of allergies and things unable to eat. those were well noted and well-taken care of! applauses for th 
"i could write a lengthy description about our experience at this place, however, most accurate is maybe the following: we have been to 1 star michelin places where we have had food which was not as good as the menu we had here, try yourself!"
"we wish we had discovered the bourbon room earlier - we would certainly have come again. the chef‚Äôs menu offers terrific dishes, with surprising, impressive flavours. i do recommend taking at least four courses. the wines complement the dishes very well. there‚Äôs a nice atmosphere in the restaurant, with the chefs compiling the dishes behind the bar and knowledgeable yet informal staff."
my wife and me had a great time last night at the bourbon ro 
"we have been travelling through europe for 9 months. this is the best restaurant in the netherlands. amazing food, service and ambience.  thank you for an amazing experience all round....keep doing what you do."
highly recommended. great fresh and seasonal food. er had five courses. perfect service and perfect atmosphere.
"food was very good, service nice and friendly. only thing was: far too long waiting between courses..."
"we used to come quite often to restaurant la locanda/silhouet la locanda in heiloo; these days the master chief was cooking there. his name is fernando jonker. then, suddenly, this miracle worker disappeared from heiloo and we were unable to localize him. fortunately, as a result of a local advertisement in a glossy, we found his new whereabouts: at the approx. 1-1.5 year old the bourbon room - that we have passed a couple of time in the last year - without knowing that our chief was working here. we could not wait to be seated by a very friendly waiter and in a simple, though friendly atmosphere we enjoyed fernandos cooking arts. the first dish of the surprise 4 course menu consisted of a very fresh and nice tasting beef carpaccio; the next one was a fish course (skrie) and the next one was a selection of veal - all very nicely balanced - with matching wines. for all those people who like myself do not eat (sweet) deserts - pls make an exception here - it is more than worth it! the chief came to our table to say hello and promised us to cook our favorite dish from the old tim "
very professional and good 4 course chef recommendation. nice restaurant layout and the service was personal and excellent.
"beautiful foodbar restaurant, fine good dishes. definitely a must for the gstronome but also cozy for a tasty snack during the cocktail ho "
"we had a very relaxing and friendly meal tonight. the waitress was very helpful and spoke good english, and apologised for not having english menus, though she offered to translate if we needed help. there was a nice choice of food and a range of prices - ‚Ç¨10 for crayfish cocktail, ‚Ç¨10 for pizza, ‚Ç¨20 for steak. also vegetarian meals, fish and pasta. nice desert and speciality coffee menu, but we were too full to try. not too busy tonight, about 6 other parties, so it was a relaxed atmosphere and not too rushed. "
the restaurant is positioned directly at the beach with a great view on the north sea (including sunset üòÅ) we went there for a coffee but since the weather was nice we stayed a bit longer. so we had a couple of beers/wines and a very tasty bread platter with tasteful food on it. the staff was very friendly so all and all we had a very enjoyable stay at the beach. 
good sea food and efficient service. nice choice of beers. free parking. nice views of the harbor. reasonable prices.
"the restaurant is situated close to the port to go to schiermonnikoog and has teracces on both sides, so easy to sit out of the wind. views are nice on the island. food was of good quality, though the warm parts of the fish platter was a bit heavy. service can move a notch up. great after a long walk"
to our surprise the sheltered sea side terrace wasnt fully booked on this lovely summer d 
"a well deserved lunch break on the top of the dike near the ferry port to schiermonnikoog. the restaurant looks clean and cosy, the waitress welcomed us friendly and showed the menu. we ordered cappuccino 3/5, apple pie with cream 4/5 and the local burger with salad and samphire 3/5. a good place for an hungry traveller."
we visited for coffee as we were early for the boat to schiermonnikoog. excellent coffee and friendly staff but what caught our eye was the fish menu. it was too early to even consider food but it was temptin 
"we were at this restaurant as the location seemed great. it turned out to have a great view from the terrace. moreover the collection of fish was nice and quality was great. lovely service, good food at a great location. must go if around."
this wonderfully located waterside restaurant offers a good selection of localnfare but the salads are not to be missed.  service first class with english spoken.
"friendly service. quietly serving, not fast. the menu was good. quality of the food was good. we think, in hoogerheide el sueno is a choice, you will not regret."
was here this week with a group of 5 persons. it is a small restaurant with not too many tables but with good weather one can eat in the private garden terrace. the food is outstanding better than we have been eating in many restaurants recently! the fish and meat dishes were excellent and fresh and also the starters and deserts were absolutely fantastic. all 5 agreed on this so it must be tr 
"this is a very nice restaurant. contemporary interior design and very nice staff. not too crowded, and a sufficient menu. worth going to."
"it was our first time at ‚Äòbij de pastorij‚Äô and we enjoyed it very much. delicious food, friendly staff,  good atmosphere!!"
the ambiance of this restaurant is atmospheric. excellent service. we had a tasty game menu. the waiter gave the perfect wine advice.
we took my mother-in-law for a birthday treat and the meal was enjoyed by us a 
"the place is packed on saturday nights. beer is included but alcohol, ribeye, and a hamburger are extra above the ‚Ç¨30 entry fee. food is fresh and as the name implies ‚Äútasty  "
"all-you-can-eat place with not only chinese food, also bbq. not to crowded on thursday night. we payed 26 ‚Ç¨ / person 2,5 h of eating. soft drinks, beer and wine included. very friendly staff. no so clean toilet."
"ok, its an all-you-can-eat place... ok, its not run by japanese people, and ok, it proposes some kind of fusion cuisine... i guess some of these points may sound not nice for purists of japanese or wok food, anyway i have to say tasty world proposes very good quality and large choice of foods, including some european style pas "
"great place to stay, staff and owners where excellent , buffet food was great . as we were staying for three weeks the owner just said to us if we want any different food they would be happy to accommodate ,was a joy to stay here for three wee "
we had a lovely dinner at boove en beneeje.  enjoying the ambience of sitting on a terrass in the evening sun. excellent food and friendly attentive waitress. extra fun seeing a hot air balloon launch from across the street.
we made the 2.5 hour drive to hoogerheide to visit family and was recommended to bove en benee 
we were taken here by our dutch friends who live close by. a lovely place with nice decor with plenty of room around your table. the menu is varied and we had about 5 dishes each some were really nice but others a little bland to be honest but all edible. they sold some nice strong beers which was a bonus
"we enjoyed dinner here with our family. food is very good, much better than might be expected in a smaller town. service and portions are above city standards and complement the dishes served. and to top it all, they have really great wines for your choosing, when you pay a bit of attenti "
"this restaurant has been around for 20 years. about 10 years ago we discovered this restaurant by coincidence. searching for a place serving game. if you love game and good red wine, this is the place to be. get the game menu, serving 4 or 5 courses. guide the owner to help you finding a good red. provide him with some tips and let him do the searching. this culinary surprise is going to leave you flabergasted. ill be back again."
"high class dining here. good wines, good service. during season also deer and other specialties. also very good for a drink and bite oursite."
this place is famous for their game menu. today we had 12 pieces menu. due to driving i only had one white and one red wine. the owner loves wines and foe enthusiasts he has surprising wines in stock. it is the drive more then worthy. do make a reservation. lunch or dinner is fine. perhaps a b&b will complete your party. 
"very good dutch dishes. well executed and very tasty. a good selection of steaks, schnitzels, chicken dishes, meat balls, hack steak etc. all supplied with generous servings of very good fries, sautee potatoes, salads and vegetables. sizable portions so you will not leave hung "
"enjoyed dinner here with our family. food is well prepared, great quality (especially the meat) and abundant quantity. service is very friendly and attentive. we thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
my friend lives locally and always comes here. we all had the set menu and the portions were gigantic! i had the tomato soup for starters and then the steak. there was so much food that i couldnt eat the fries and vegetable 
"good old fashioned food, meat 3 fresh veg and 2 potatoes dishes x 2 plus drinks for a fraction ove ‚Ç¨50,00. top marks"
"amazing place. food was really good, staff very friendly, really child friendly with huge play area outside and small activity stations inside - makes all the difference to having a relaxed stress free family meal with young children. well definitely be back while on holiday in de twee bruggen (20 minutes easy bike ride with kids)! "
"great pancakes, super nice burger, kids playing corner, nice train-like atmosphere. a great place if you are looking for something special and like pancakes."
we visited this pancake house on the way back from an energetic morning in the swimming po 
"good pancakes, but also all other things to eat. this place is special for childrens entertainment, they can play outsite with a broad spectrum of items. parent can enjoy a drink during the play time. a good place to stay and they offer a lot other things like catering and so on."
"easy going accomodation when travelling by car, bike or hiking on the old main road between zwolle and apeldoorn"
"this restaurant is a small town treasure. the pannenkoekens we had here were among the best we have ever had. the service was very good and the place has atmosphere. it has both indoor and outdoor seating. being a nice day, we sat outside and really enjoyed our food and the attentive service."
"great little cafe in bruinisse ... open when other places were closed. johnny is a great host ... his chicken skewers were prefect and his frites were great. i wanted to go back and get some more chicken ... and perhaps and ice cream cone, but we ran out of time, but if i am back in the area ... i will make a stop at johnnys."
i speak dutch but cant write it so i tell you in english. we had very good and delicious food and we will come back soon
"we visited on a very quiet wednesday night , we were the only ones to dine in as i think they do lots of take away orders . we ordered a mushroom and pineapple pizza , a chicken and ham pizza and a meat calzone with generous toppings all terrific , i‚Äôm a bit of a pizza expert and i go with the smell of the dough and crispness of the base , it was devine . just wished i stayed nearer oh and the staff were very nice as well . 10/10"
"being in zeeland for a long weekend we ordered 2 pizzas for delivery hoping theyd be ok. in fact, we were really surprised how good they were. good dough and quality of ingredients at a reasonable price. we rally didnt expect to get such pizza quality in this area and can truly recommend it. we didnt visit the restaurant itself so cant say anything about the place / service."
"we were staying in the area and found the food here to be delicious. they also do pizza but we didnt try it, opting instead for the turkish specialties all of which were tasty. tap beer was inexpensive and good. portions were plentiful. they have a nice dining room and outdoor seating as well. a pleasant experience overall."
"we visited several times in august. we came here for lunch, dinner and drinks and loved it every time. the food was delicious, we had lunch, cakes and dinner dishes and all were well. friendly and quick service. our son liked it here. theres a playground near the terrace and its adjacent to a forest play area, which is super fun for kids. "
"what a great location in the forest , all the mains we had where very good as where the deserts . service was ok and friendly , and we had a option to sit outside or inside which was nice as it was a lovely sunny afternoon."
"in the midst of the herpen forest near the city of oss youll find this old rebuilt villa with its contempory stylish interior. while it is most known for the traditional dutch pannekoeken in a variety of tastes i can also recommend the other dishes on the menu. the chefs team is up to any challenge as it seems to dish up delicious seafood as easily as a fine-food course of beef, pork or any other carnivorous guilty pleasures. be sure t slap this one one your short list if you are in the den bosch region while wanting to dine out with collegues, friends or family!!"
"as an american having lived in the netherlands, this is possibly one of the best restaurants value and quality wise i have ate a "
after a hike in de herperduinen is a stop at pan & zo a must. service is very good! food is excellent!
"we always have a good time going out for a truly phantastic pancake here. the restaurant is located beautifully in the forest and its interior is very nice. a good place for food, coffee or drinks after a walk in the forest. and if you dont like pancakes, you should really try one! otherwise they have also a choice of other items on the menu."
i watched this restaurant getting built and was curious to know how it would go as there is another restaurant close by. i walk in the forest that surrounds the restaurant every week as i am a local so i was excited to finally go in and try it. they have really invested in a stylish and modern restaurant with trendy decor. it is cozy in winter and the great big doors open up to a sunny terrace. even though it is a pancake restaurant it is not a typical kids one you would imagine. it has a variety of food and yes kids are welcome but there is something for everyone. the prices are affordable and the food is ample. (the pancakes i can never finish!). if you are in herpen duin and you shouldnt miss out in having a coffee here after a walk/run/cycle. you can also plan a nice evening out here because its always friendl 
"have visited this place several times. outstanding atmosphere. last time during the marriage of our son and daughter in law. good food, excellent staff. will go back soon to celebrate our birthdays etc."
"a foreigners here, the team have been amazing with the warm hospitality and the food exceeded expectations. i highly recommend this as an alternative to a meal at center parcs as a date night. we had the surprise me menu that was really awesome."
"excellent non traditional and smart dishes,and a service with a smile and willingness to address our kids special requests."
"we love this place, nice food and family run.  it was our saviour as we stayed at centre parks (which we enjoy) but the restaurants aren‚Äôt very good there."
heavy traffic jams on the highway made us go an alternative route and we saw this nice place at the heyen industrial park. what a nice surprise; perfect salads for lunch!
"the service was awesome, toys for kids, different seats for babies and also for younger children who also want a high chair. toys for the kids while waiting for food and the food! everyone was pleased including the kids. also recommend the beer tasting. we are at the nearby center parcs and the food here is of great quality. we got lovely suggestions also on what to see nearby, thank you for all."
"we had pancakes for our lunch. a small range of toppings were on offer. they were a decent size for lunch. maybe because we were in a group of five but some of the pancakes were a bit undercooked and they were a bit on the stodgy and heavy side. quite pricey, but this is quite a remote location"
"in geesteren, a small village in the achterhoek in holland, i discovered a great kitchen at baan restaurant. the food was delicious and the shrimp croquettes were amazing tasty. beautiful decoration of the dishes and friendly people. i stayed here just a few days, but visited the restaurant two times. when i would come here again i will definitely go back."
"very crowdy but good choices ice from good quality good plces to sit and enjoy ,people are very friendly"
"the ice-salon has a great selection of very good ice, and friendly staff. at the back you can see the production of ice going on. the place is very clean."
"very nice dinner with the family, all adults. restaurants looks beautiful and the staff is very friendly. portions are very generous and taste good."
"bloody good steak...  we entered the restaurant with our dogs, which is no problem...first positive impression. very friendly staff...second positive impression.  we ordered the tomahawk steak for two... when it arrived at the table...grilled to perfection in medium. perfect taste.  thanks....will be back again."
"we visited on a cold snowy january evening. despite not many guests the restaurants natural atmosphere shone through. the restaurant menu is very good and i can recommend the bbq pork ribs. the service was quick, though i‚Äôm sure on an ‚Äúin season‚Äù weekend the place would be very busy."
"if youre expecting great food, probably not the place for you, but if you just want to enjoy drinks and snacks/simple meals whilst looking out over the sea, this is a great place. you can be in full sun outside, behind a glass screen sheltering from the wind, or even in doors still with great views. place is nicely done out and not just a beach shack. we really enjoyed it, but please be aware im not saying the food is 5 star, but i think the experience is."
"my wife insisted we go there, my expectations were low: it looks like a beach snack with soggy fries. but to my surprise, the food was much better. we went there twice and tried different courses. they all were better than expected, quite good actually. i had two different soups that didnt taste like convenience gastro-food. so, if youre in bathing trunks or a bit sweaty from a bike tour and dont feel at ease at nearby trendy paal6, go and enjoy them on the (somewhat wind protected) terrace."
"our favorite restaurant. good food, friendly staff,delicious sangria. various tapas, also for vegetarians"
"very nice place, friendly people and good service. food was delicious, although not everything to our taste. all was well prepared and tasted as it should.  will come again for sure."
"first visit to this restaurant and certainly not my last. tapas are delicious and so much choice. it was very busy and a bit crowded, not much space between tables or to move around. i do not like to have a huge dog sitting so close to me when i am eating."
"i really like this restaurant. it looks nice, the food is pretty good and the prices is also pretty good. you have a deal for 23,00 for all you can eat on friday and saterday and the rest of the week is het even cheape "
the selection of different foods on the menu was diverse and the preparation was well done.  the servers were polite and managed to provide you with an opportunity to choose more dishes.  i found this place most enjoyable.  very casual...
"the selection is perfect, except my wife wanted a steak. i opted for the lamb and it was perfectly prepared. great wine selection and the staff is friendly and very attentive."
dinner after family trip to tex 
many choices and good quality of food and service nice friendly people close to my home good for a whole evening sitting there
"what a lovely restaurant. we were a family of 9 with a mixture of adults and children. the owners were very welcoming, helpful and spoke english to us. the food was all delicious and everyone was happy with their choices. they had a children‚Äôs menu too. the menu had a good range of food and drinks. the decor inside is lovely. "
the food was excellent. the waitress friendly and fast. and they were very kind to my daughter and her friends!
menu offers more variety than the standard dutch seaside provision. well cooked with good friendly service.
"we ended up here by chance and were very pleasantly surprised. nice choice of dishes, very knowledgeable staff and very welcoming. the food was excellent as was the presentation."
i love this road restaurant. enter the netherlands and got some food here. visit also bad nieuweschans .
you got to be there. best watersport-location in zeeland. 360 grad good vabrations. all gear available. great hosts.
"we visited twice in just three days, we loved the style of the building, the location, variety of menu, and friendliness of the staff. well worth a visit and a nice walk down to the complex from nearby center parcs."
we had a nice dinner and could even bring our dog. something that is unfortunately not possible in the center parcs where we are stayi 
"went here for a dinner with 6 (2 kids). we reserved a spot and got seated on the 1st floor where it is a bit quiet. very nice as we wanted to catch up with some friends. ground floor is pretty noisy but it can be more convenient with (young) kids as the playground is situated there.we ordered a soup-of the day, and bruchettas and nachos to share. both bruchettas and the nachos were very good, in particular the sour-cream was excellent. portion sizes decent (also for the rest of the meals). mains were 2 kids menus (chicken nuggets and pancakes), kids menu is very extensive (compared to others). burger with fries, chicken satay skewers, poke bowl (vegan) and prime ribs (irish). when they served the food they forgot the burger. quickly apologies were made and the burger came very fast. eventually this was convenient as they shared the burger and the satay, so not bad all in all. desserts were stroopwaffel ice-cream, dame blanche and two ben and jerrys (cookie dough). the stroopwaffel ice-cream was not stroopwaffel ice-cream but vanilla ice-cream with pieces of stroopwaffel (and came with small liquor, baileys). fine by me but the menu could set you at false expectations. downside was the whipped cream was not so good, while they had hot chocolate including the real whipped cream. dont really get the reason for that. we ended up with some tea and coffee, very tasty. all in all we sat for more than three hours and had a great evening."
"we were staying at center parcs & visited 3 times, twice for dinner & once watching the kids on the hell sli "
"after a good saturday-morning exercise we decided to take our breakfast here. after ordering a large cappuccino and a double expresso we ordered the big-breakfast plate and a home-made granola yogurt (and honey) bowl. the place is nicely situated near the lake and has cabins where you can sleep for ht night, so (although in the morning) it was quite busy with people enjoying a good breakfast. close by you can surf the lake, paddle and do all kind of water-sports. inside there is a large restaurant but seen the fact it was beautiful weather there was no need going inside (but seen the ambiance and the menu we will for sure try dinner here soon too). the food was served in a timely manner, the granola-yoghurt was nicely presented in a glass pot with honey on the side. the breakfast plate was really huge, bread pistolet, more bread, croissant, egg (boiled, add scrambled was possible at a surcharche) jam, 2 types of butter, chocolate spread, chocolate sprinkles, ham, cheese, salami and an orange juice. this will get you kickstarted for the day! the granola-yoghurt was also very tasty and well portioned. price compared you do quite get a big more food for your money if you order the big-breakfast plate. anyway, we decided to stay i little (and order some more drinks) but i found out that you actually had to pay for wi-fi. sorry, but that is not 2018 like anymore. this might had to to with the houses etc. which are part of this premise. obviously your restaurant guests have to use the wi-fi for free (and i think the people who stay for the night also). at least offer a 3-4 hour free pass each day or something. anyway, we quickly finished our drinks and left. make the wi-fi free and you get full 5 stars (it also means more revenue as people will stay longer, thus eat and drink more). hope this is realised when we return here for dinner (which we for sure will do). service is excellent by the way, only when we were trying to get the bill it was kind of hard, no one was inside and eventually we just walked to someone on the terrace who immedialty presented us with the bill, so all good!"
"this place was excellent. great view and the interior was beautiful. the food was very good but portions were quite big so i would recommend not bothering with starters. child-friendly, good kids menu, playground outside and a kids movie area. we visited here several times and would really recommend their fries. great for a nice meal after a long bike ride. the staff were really friendly. would really recommend this!!!"
"we were staying in port zelande and wanted to try somewhere outside the resort. so glad we tried here, the location is great, the decor is lovely, the staff were very friendly and the food was delicious! would definitely recommend here for a drink or something to eat, wished wed found it on our first day and not our last!"
food and drinks are always very good here! we always come to this place when we are around. the place re-opened early this year and they created a very beautiful spot! the view is astonishing!
visited twice and loved the place. good food and water sports - if only there were places like this in uk.
"once we discovered this place, we visited almost every day! we tried paddle boarding and the slide. the staff are friendly and the site seems very safe. you can hire equipment with or without tuition. there is a restaurant and bar on site."
"a hidden gem - every dish was sublime with bold flavors and fresh ingredients. the spectacular food is served in beautiful dishes , in a super stylish restaurant with great service (not easy to find in nl). easily one of the more memorable dining experiences in the netherlands- was worth the 1.5hr drive from amsterdam for sure!"
"the restaurant is very beautiful and cozy, the menu offers a nice variety without being overwhelming. quality of the food was excellent, pricing is totally fair. the service was truly outstanding, our waiter noticed we‚Äòd ordered vegetarian dishes except one and came back to us to ask if that had been intentional or if we wanted to change our order. never encountered such a thoughtful and attentive service before. 5 stars in all areas, and we‚Äòll certainly be back. "
"had a great lunch here. lovely atmosphere, really well styled and good service. loved the risotto and carpaccio salad. served with great wines. recommended! something different than the standard dutch restaurants."
"we loved the 5 courses so much we added another course. perfect wine accommodations. perfect service. we went there hungry, we left satisfied. thank you"
my daughter and her friend selected this restaurant based on the modern look when walking by the closed restaurant the evening before. what an excellent surprise! great wine and food combinations served by the whole female staff. i had the 4 course surprise menu with wine arrangement together with my daughter and great 
delicious food with great care about gluten free options when asked (majority of menu is or can be served gluten free). the sommelier did a great job providing matching wines. service was lovely.
nice and friendly staff. the food was good and everything was in right time! i totally recommended it. the room was a little noisy but all the rest was great.
"we chose the 4 course surprise meal with wine arrangement. although the portions were small, they were delicious and very well presented. each course came first with a different wine. although obviously excellent wines, i did feel the glass was just a little under filled, considering the price. the atmosphere was great, very chic and cosy. we booked for 8pm but our table wasnt available until 8:30, so sat outside on the terrace to wait. all-in-all an excellent restaurant, an absolute must-visit when in ouddorp."
i was in ouddorp for a week and i ate at various restaurants around the area.this place is the best in town by far! hands down.
we have been in this restaurant for the second time and had have a very nice eveni 
"we enjoyed a nice early evening at zus. the young team is nice, helpful and very friendly. the food was very nice and the portions are just right. except for the mousse au chocolat: 2 miserably small cornets filled with probably not even a tea- spoon of mousse over a blop of whipped cream. and this for euro 9.50 "
"went here for a saturday evening dinner, we reserved and if we did not we for sure would not have a place to dine here. it is really a very nice place, ambiance and location. just near the city center of ouddorp (well, village actually). anyway we enjoyed a great variety of food, it is tapas but not as small. the desserts are general and normal sized. the food is splitted in cold-warm-starters main and sides. you can make the menu you want and offer it being served in courses or all at once if you want, good choice of wine, open kitchen (nice to look into) and good service. we enjoyed a great dinner with good quality food. people that work here enjoy their job and that is something that does the taste good."
"went here on a saterday evening, made a reservation, good we did because it was a full house. it has a very relaxed feel to it, staff very friendly and they have a great winelist. we enjoyed a 5-course surprise menu, both fish and meat dishes. it is one of those places i would love to go back to more often, if only we would live closer. really recommended, you won‚Äôt be disappointed . "
"we waited for our dish a little bit longer but it totally worth the time. this cozy restaurant left a great impression. friendly hosts, great steak and spare ribs (special mention to the simple but tasty rice i selected as side dish) , good presentation and the dessert omg coconut icecream in half coconut and orange ice cream in the oran "
"we (6 adults and our 3 year old son) were wandering around ouddorp looking for somewhere for an evening meal and we came across this place. it looked busy to which is always a good sign, so we went inside and were greeted & seated immediately. the service from the outset was very very good, very attentive and informative without feeling overpowering and intrusive. we sampled the burgers, lamb chops, chicken and the mixed grill. everyone was really pleased with their individual choices, with the quality and quantity both excelle "
there are several restaurants and food outlets in the centre of ouddorp. this had a little bit more class than most - best seen inside the restaurant despite lots of external table 
"relax atmosphere and uncomplicated service. good food, nicely presented. reasonable prices. early closing hours."
we had a fantastic time in this place and i had the best spare ribs i ever had. even the salmon was delicious .. friendly service..fair prices..we coming back next time..
"we arrived in town too early to check into our hotel. on a sunday, most everything is closed, which we found out when we tried to go to a museum so we parked and walked along the street taking pictures a building from the 1700s. we then saw this restaurant and decided to give it a try. they have an english menu upon request. i ordered a salad that had cheese and nuts that blended well with the vegetables. my husband ordered a burger but wished he had asked for well done. it was fairly rare for his liking but he ate it all anyway. the server was friendly and the restaurant and toilets were very clean. we will likely return if we have time on this trip "
"our original intent was to dine at another location in the beautiful little dutch village of ouddorp, however it was fully booked so we walked the few short streets in town to find an alternati "
"the location is beautiful, very central. they offer a wide variety of pancakes, al that we tried were delicious. the only thing is that the service, although friendly, was very slow. my kid had a sausage and wanted ketchup (i know... ketchup...) by the time he got it everyone had finished eating and of course his food was cold. we each had time for two drinks before we got our food. then wait for the check... it was a crowded thursday afternoon but still, maybe more waiters?"
very nice place with tasty food. it took a bit long to get our lunch but it tasted amazing. recommended!
booked this place up front. very convenient on their website where you could state of you have an allergy or need a child chair. we ordered pancakes and eggs on ham and bread. there is a kids corner and the place is very nicely decorated and very pleasan 
"we booked a table for 10 at 6pm and glad we did as the restaurant was full, as soon as we took our reserved table. the choice of pancakes was bewildering but we eventually found our favourite. we specificaly asked for hot chocolate sauce in a jug to accompany the pancake and icecream, instead the chocolate was drizzleed over the pancake which was not our specification.the buiding dates back to 1774 and the interior has been well preserved. service was swift and pleasant. a good experience to try something typically dutch."
"had a nice lunch here. service was very friendly and fast. liked the sweet pancakes best. the savory ones come with the same batter, unlike a french galet."
"we were driving from amsterdam to belgium via the dutch coast and were looking for somewhere to stop for lunch. ideally we wanted somewhere on the coast but on driving through this pretty village on the way to the coast we decided to stop . the restaurant is in the square and you can either eat inside in old dutch building , out the front or next to the square under the conker trees. as it was a nice day we sat under the trees but we and all the people on the other tables kept having to dodge falling conkers . luckily none actually landed on us or the meals but it made for an entertaining hour . we ordered from the extensive pancake menu and both had the cheese ham and apple ones . they came with thin slices of a apple covered with cheese and pieces of ham . very filling and tasty . overall a good spot for a quick and filling lunch"
we were served very quickly and very friendly. the pancakes were very tasty. we will definitely return here when revisiting ouddorp!
"we had just gone shopping in ouddorp and fancied a wander and something to eat.there, in the middle of town, around the church was a number of places to eat but the smell was drawing my other half in one direction....pannenkoekenhuis de platte hap. as it wasnt the warmest of days we decided to sit indoors and loved the dutch living room atmosphere the place had; many traditional features and decor made the whole place feel welcoming and cosy. in contrast, the stunning and modern bathroom facilities felt very clean and up-mark "
"my family of 5 ordered 5 different pancakes, and they were all so delicious. portions were generous and filling. service was friendly, and as an added bonus, the restaurant has a nice little play/reading area for the little guests. decor and atmosphere was very cozy. prices were on the high side, but when on holiday and the food is good, its a forgivable little flaw."
"we enjoyed eating here a few times. each time we received fantastic, warm service, enjoyed the pleasant traditional and fun surroundings and enjoyed a very nice meal. definitely worth s visit if you are staying in port zealande."
worth a visit for those after proper pannekoeken (pancake 
"excellent food, really delicious. great value for large plates of very tasty traditional dutch lunch food. good service and friendly multilingual staff. brilliant."
"during our 1 week vacation, we ate here 3 times. everything is homemade and tastes just wonderful. when u r in the area and just wanna have a tiny snack, u need to try their homemade apple cake. it is super delicious"
"been in the area for almost a week and easily the best meal we have had since arriving. can‚Äôt fault anything; awesome service, great food, lovely setting, kid friendly and value for money!"
stopped here again recently as the weather was nice enough to sit outside and we remembered our last visit was very nice indee 
"we wandered around ouddorp looking for a nice lunch spot. noticed quite a few locals going in here and followed them in. we were welcomed warmly by the lady behind the till who gave us menus. her english was excellent (thankfully) and she offered to explain things to us. the menu is in dutch and german only do this was much appreciated. the kids had burgers which they loved. the chips were freshly made and hand cut. i had the sate chicken and my husband had the fillet steak (a steal at ‚Ç¨13). it was the nicest steak hes had in years. everything was delicious and the portions are generous. shame that this was the last day of our holiday, we would have returned otherwise!"
"stopped here for a bite to eat on saturday evening. our order was taken by a lovely young lady, very polite and friendly. the dishes chosen were well presented and tasted very nice. her male colleague was also very pleasant and friendly. and in the end the bill was also rather pleasant and friendly :-). so all in all a very nice experience."
what a treat to (try) and select the flavour ice cream you fancy. service was quick and helpful. very reasonable prices and all flavours we tried were delicious!
"whether you are a local or a tourist, you will find a flavour of ice cream you like. the scoops are of a very generous size, so you might want to take it easy on the ordering. that, however, is difficult as we found it very hard to choo "
"friendly staff, quick and good service. food was good. they even had some belgian beers. probably the best chinese restaurant of andijk."
"we ate here 6 adults and a baby. the food is tasty, like old chinese restaurant in the 90s. it was completely empty which was fun. it has a childrens menu and a high chair. it really suited us at the moment, we enjoyed it. oh and we loved the decor."
"this is a great find in the nature park midway between the two center parcs sites. great selection of savoury and sweet pancakes (the blueberry one is stuffed with fruit, my son also loved his apple and cinnamon pancake. great selection of local beer too. closed monday amd tuesdays, friendly staff. if obly it opened for breakfast."
"we visited when staying at a local centre parcs. this restaurant is situated in beautifully bucolic surroundings that teem with butterflies and dragonflies. the pancakes and bitterballen were absolutely delicious, i had the large ‚Äòfarmers‚Äô pancake that included cheese, bacon, onions and mushrooms, my daughters had sweet pancakes, one simple pancake with syrup the other loaded with blueberries. the pancakes are very filling, and reasonably priced, perfect for a break in a long walk or bike ride to take in the wildlife and beautiful countryside the restaurant is set in."
this restaurant serves a selection of delicious pancakes and is very affordable. the most expensive pancake (boerenpannekoek) is only 10.50 eur 
"excellent  food & wine , very friendly service ,   very relaxing  surroundings .perfect place for  families ."
very good starters: fish soup with salmon rolls or ham and melon. very fine italian wine. good choice of excellently cooked/fried fish and meat with al dente cooked vegetabl 
"i went here with my family last week, the atmosphere was great, most tables were booked but there is a good distance between the tables which made it not feel crowded but lively. the food was good for the price (not spectacular, but good food combined with a large variety of beers on the card made it totally worth the buck). a welcome surprise was when we ordered a cheese plate for desert: on the menu this was only available as a snack, the chef came out of the kitchen to ask us if they can make a special configuration of cheeses that go better as a desert vs a snack option. it showed that despite a full house, they are able to tune the menu to specific wishes beyond the menu which i highly value. besides that the owner of the place came to check on us and verified that the cheese plate met our desires. all in all a great experience in a beautiful traditional zeelandish barn-house. i fully recommend this place"
fantastic place for dinner. prices are not too high for the very good quality food and nice wine. staff is very friendly.
really interesting fusion type menu with a very strong slant towards indonesian / malaysian flavours & textures. service is prompt and charmi 
"very nice vibrant location in the center, on a main shopping street, good vibe and atmosphere.  service is friendly. the broodje van de eeuw was disappointing, certainly for the price of ‚Ç¨11,25."
"stopped in for lunch. restaurant was clean with fast, friendly service. our food was good and so many items they were serving look delicious as well. we will eat here again."
"i‚Äôve eaten here twice and my groups have tried multiple menu items. food presentation, quality and variety are excelle "
we enjoyed our lunch with family. great food and good service. value for money. recommrnded to visit!
"we loved the place. the food was good, nice presentation, and the desserts: divine!! i will definitely come back."
"it started with good parking on ‚Äòde markt‚Äô. no fee after 18:00. service was quick in the restaurant, although time between starter and main course could have been quicker. great tournedos from the grill!"
"i have been here several times and the menu is each time amazing. all dishes were full of flavor and well prepared. i like the mix from different latin american dishes and styled, its round and varied, and the wine cart is also very good."
"good atmosphere, spacious, its sitiuated in the same building as the theatre. great food. steak was cooked exactly as i ordered it. lovely first course, not thrilled about the dessert i chose, it was a bit dry, but the others looked great!"
"tasty food, good wines, great service, nice location. we had a fantastic night out with our friends."
"the food, the atmosfeer, the waiters and the music was very good. every saturday there is life music and this restaurant is linked to the theater, so when you go to see a show it is nice to have a lovely diner first in this restaurant."
"we were enthused on arrival at cusco, the greeting was friendly and the d√©cor including lots of twinkly lights was very ni "
"this is the first time we have visited cusco and it wont be the last. my wife spotted it and as we live just down the road took me there for my birthday dinner. its not cheap but the food was excellent, i had the combination nachos to start and they were great! the homemade salsa, melted cheese and nachos were delicious and fresh tasting, and the portion size was just right. washed that down with a good sized glass of white wine. had the ribeye for main and that was cooked to perfection. washed that down with a wonderful malbec.for desert i chose the churos with a condensed milk dip and vanilla ice-cream. wonderful!. another great restaurant in this surprisingly foodie town"
"my new favourite place! take the best service and care you can imagine, add excellent food from the tapas menu, and count in nice, calming atmosphere. on top of that, a good selection of beverages. i will definitely make sure to come back whenever im in the area. not only that, i will make a detour if needed. "
"brilliant restaurant, great food especially the schnitzel and the burgers looked great too - the double burger was actually 2 burgers not 2 layers on meat ...... you will certainly come away from this place full and very happy with your choice  great staff too"
"we went for the tapas option and had a fantastic night out.  the food was tasty, service good and super friendly, prices are reasonable. we didnt experience the slow service as mentioned by others.   all together a great night out and well be back soon"
fantastic food - friendly sta 
"good food. good choices. good starters, like bruchetta. nice seats insite. and also a big terrace outside with heating lamps."
"although menu is not too long, but food was very tasty. enjoyed grilled catch of the day that was well balanced, nicely served and ver tasty.  nice service, spacious place.  overall is a good value for money."
"had lunch and liked it. food was tasty, staff friendly and the food was presented in a colourful inventive way.   would certainly return and recommend to others."
"right 8n the centre of uden on the top floor of the classy and well known department store ‚Äú hout brox‚Äù, this is great for a stylish sandwich or salad for lunch. the service is excellent and the prices reasonable with new dishes not on the menu every month."
more a caf√© than a brasserie as the hot food selection is limited. good for a lunch break rather than a long dinner. however food freshly prepared and good quality. never would have found it without tripadvisor reviews as on top floor of hout brox department store. roof terrace sitting if weather permits. normally closes at 6pm but open until 9pm on fridays with greater menu selection.
"on top of the hout brox fashion house is a hidden gem. food is great, lots of choice. atmosphere is good, the roof terrace is amazing if the sun is shinin "
"food is top quality, lot of originality in the selection of the day. perfect for a fast brunch as well as a proper environment for a business lunch."
"de conversatie, located on the top floor of the large store hout-brox in udens lively town center, will surprise you with the quality of food, drinks and especially the staff serving you. for dutch standards the ladies are extremely friendl "
even on a mondayafternoon this place is full. a very smart concept in a clothesstore. with fresh products included the dishes were lovely. we were sitting next to the windows and had a great view and the sun coming in. great experience.
"a different kind of high tea, with only products from around uden. also tea from a carrousel (not with tea bags) and it all looks and tastes very good! a nice atmosphere and good service."
"we stayed at the brasserie during a visiting travel on gen 2015 . we were a group of 15 farmers/educators from italy, and everybody liked the food and the the atmosphere !! keep it up!"
visited this restaurant for lunch and really enjoyed the ambiance. the staff were lovel 
"been there a few times already, trendy beautiful place with nice atmosphere and view over the centre of uden, food is always perfect and service as well!"
"we have been using this restaurant for many years,both when we lived in uden and now, when we visit from the uk. the design and layout of this eatery has changed and been improved over the years and recently extended. the restaurant is often busy and bustling and at lunchtimes it is a good idea to reserve a table as it is usually full of enthusiastic regular customers! the menu offers a reasonably diverse selection of dishes without being too ambitious with what the kitchen can sensibly cope with and provide. this allows the kitchen to really concentrate on getting all the items on the menu just right. in our experience, if there are any discrepancies with the food served, the staff quickly and efficiently rectify any problems. in fact,the expertise and polite professionalism of the staff is one of the main reasons we continue to patronise this establishment! we should also mention the very attractive and creative floral displays which decorate the restaurant. we look forward to eating here on our next visit to uden."

"excellent front of house. personable friendly but professional service throughout. food interesting enough and well cooked enough to deserve a michelin star. wine match interesting and fine, but seemed to try to be different above being spot on (sometimes the classic matches shouldn‚Äôt be ignored "
"what a nice place. in uden a small city near nijmegen we enjoyed a lovely evening out. excellent wines and excellent diner, their michelin star earned well"
"we had dinner with friends and had a great evening! the ambiance was very relaxed and informal, the staff was very friendly and the food and wine were delicious. we had the sommelier menu where food was prepared to pair with a specific wine. delicious food and wines and very original approach! we live about 150km from here and will plan to come back again."
"very surprising menu, perfect in balance, good wines. the restaurant, situaties in the center of uden, is style bert trendy and you feel at home right away. young and enthusiastic team!"
"i ate here when on a business trip to the netherlands, as with nearly all the restaurants i have visited in the netherlands the food ad service were lovely. the decor is modern and the place is relaxing with superb staff who spoke perfect english and were happy to explain the dishes to me. i had 3 courses and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here. i would definitely return here if in the area, and can highly recommend this place."
"the restaurant, situated in the center of uden, is styled very trendy and you feel at home right away. we have been enjoying the 5-course menu including wine pairing. at each course, we were again surprised by beautiful ingredients and combinations. a young, enthusiastic team explained the different dishes. also a big compliment to the sommelier, the wines were not obvious but all matched with the dishes. thanks to the whole team for a beautiful evening."
"fantastic food, beautifully prepared by a great young team. best fois gras appetizer i had in a long time. oysters and fish super fresh on a tuesd "
"took a very discerning out of town guest here from paris, and we all enjoyed it. lovely smart casual dining- excellent food, service, wine, with that nice mixture of friendly relaxation and everything done right. will definitely go again. i had the vegetarian menu, something very hard to find in fine dining restaurants. "
if youve ever thought about michelen star dining but didnt have a wallet to fit then do not despair. onivoo will deliver the experience for you. and you will have change. thijs and his team delivered spectacular dishes and the presentation was a true art form. they have an inspiring website and the impression that it leaves you is not an exaggeration. those dishes as photographed are exactly what you can expec 
came to this restaurant for dinner with business colleagues and it was probably the best meal i‚Äôve ever had in my life. each plate that came out looked like art and tasted even better. highly recommend.
"amazing dinner!! besides a superb main course and a great dessert, we also got a lot of small dishes in between to die for.. i can truly recommend this restaurant!!"
worth every penny!! amazing service!! staff very service minded . good prices for the kind of food and dishes you get
"was here for an inspection job in oss with one colleague. decided to go for the top restaurant in uden. we were not disappointed. we took the 4-course menu. good food, prepared with local and fresh ingredients. wines from the arrangement matched very well with the food and were of good quality. the seating and atmosphere is above average. the waiting between the courses was quiet long - a bit too long in our opinion."
everything was freshly prepared.  the food was delicious and wind menu equally good.  great service and amuse bouche and petit fours with coffee equally amazing
"cosy, quiet, nice atmosphere. good for business but also family dinner.   very good service.  food is nice, absolutely more than average dutch food !!  i would go back !  food 8/10 place 8/10 service 8/10"
"we are frequent visitors to the raadhuis in uden. this was our 8th visit in four years. after its take over by another headchef last year inity they struggled a bit but after last week we are totally hooked on raadhuis again. we choose the excellent value for money special menu. 55 euros each including accompanying wines (but excluding water 6 euros a liter, fizzy or flat "
very delicious food in a cosy and central setting. between the courses we where served little very nice bites. recommendable!
"very good service, very nice menu for the price you pay! dont hesitate, this is probably the best restaurant in uden!"
the service from the staff is 100%. friendly people and a very good kitchen. try it u are never disappointed.
owner/chef rob van de velden did not go with every new trend but has maintained his high level of quality over the years. hospitality must be the middel name of his sommelier. excellent food and excellent pricing!
"for a very important business meeting we were inviting the members of our board of directors for the first time. we had looked for a location with the right atmosphere and found raadhuis in uden. this was such a good decision. the dinner was memorable for all of us - the food was wonderful, the service spot on - we hope to come back again soon!"
"family gathering with 17 started with a private meeting in a separate room and welcome drink followed by a wonderful meal in the large private function / dining room. beautifully presented 6 course meal and wine, staff very attentive and even asked individuals about their allergies or preferences, nice portions and gaps between each servin "
"i just enjoyed one the the best meal that i have ever eaten in the netherlands (or anywhere else). the service was attentive yet unobtrusive, the wine was good for the price and the food was superb. i had the duck with goose liver to start and the dover sole as the main course. both dishes were best in class. the prices are in line with the quality of the food and service and i will visit het raadhuis if i ever stay in uden again."
"we had lunch here with some friends and really enjoyed it. i had the sandwich of the house (euro 7,40) and it tasted excellent. in combination with some good and friendly service this is a 5 star for me. i can definitely recommend going here."
probably the best ice cream shop in town. amazing ice cream and enough place to sit to enjoy your ice cream. well done.
"gorgeous ice cream with a good selection of different flavours. we went in here and they were extremely friendly, spoke good english (better than our dutch!) and helped us translate some of the flavours. the kids throughly enjoyed their ice cream and my husband recommends dolce latte flavour though he didnt get to see much of it with the little one!"
"there are 2 great places to enjoy a good icecream, this is one of them, the other one is bananas, you cant go wrong to chosse this one :-)"
a wide range of flavors (94). they experiment with new flavors all the time and the guest is often surprised with something n 
"if your looking for a run of the mill ice cream cone, dont come here! but my friends, if you are looking for an ice cream extravaganza then this is the place to be! located near the heart of uden this shoppe makes all their own ice creams, ice yogourts and ice milks as well as a darn good cup of tea or coffee. enjoy your iced treats in the peaceful shade under an ancient tree with other grownups remembering their childhood years."
"great franchise that started in uden and already has 28 restaurants. nice ambiance, friendly staff and a great selection of tapas. not your avarage all you can eat. quality over quantity."
we had a great dinner here. it‚Äôs all you can eat for 30‚Ç¨ and kids for 7‚Ç¨. incredible value for the amount of food and quality you get! drinks are typical prices! staff was friendly and many spoke english! highly recommend!
"this is an all you can eat tapas restaurant with a broad menu that did not disappoint. i have been here twice with a group of 8-12. the staff was very friendly and they were able to provide menus in english and most spoke english too. the food will keep coming as long as you write down what you want, so make sure you are ready. even with the wide variety of food on the menu, it was fresh, hot and flavorful. make sure to call ahead for a reservation, because they stay busy. overall, this was a great place to enjoy a meal!!"
"this place is great, proven by the fact it was full to the rafters....on a monday night !!! a tapas restaurant with a great concept. you pay a set amount per person and get a bundle of lists, on which you can mark the dishes (2 p,p. per round) you would like, for as many rounds as you like. and all the dishes we had were very very good. the atmosphere was very warm and homely and the staff were very well mannered, pleasant, friendly and hard working. delightful  "
this restaurant was recommended by local people as one to be famous from good food and interesting form of serving. and indeed it was quite interesting - quests are chosing small tapas several rounds so there is possibility to try many of dishes. servis was a bit slow but maybe it was because we were quite a big group. and once going out with big group - watch out! someone may steal your order ;)
"i have been here a few times before, but every time i still love the concept. so many options for anybody. we had two persons with a special wish for food: lactose free and no meat. and still, also for them there was more than enough. the service was great. manon was doing a very good job. she just started working there and used a lot of humor which we could really appreciate."
nice cozy restaurant with great food. interior looks are cool! i enjoyed an affordable and tasteful meal!
"very good burgers, friendly service, accepted visa card, clean restrooms. kids play area on one side of the restaurant. no english menu available, but staff was helpful answering questions. many cute novelty items for sale in the restaurant. we will definitely come back."
"we enjoyed our stay at the restaurant de belhamel. it was a very nice place with a nice view to the canal. the boeuf belhamel was very tender and the cheesecake delicious. the service was very kind and the restaurant is dog friendly, which is quite rare in amsterdam ( we always travel with our little jack russel) "
"we had the seasonal menu, the main menu was a bit pricey for what we were looking to pay on this particular trip. the food was delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere suits. this was one of the best meals we have had outside of a michelin restaurant, thoroughly enjoyed it. if you are on a bit of a budget, check that you like the seasonal menu on their website before you go."
"this wonderful little restaurant is located right where one canal t-bones another. at outdoor seating or in the restaurant itself, you can look straight down the one canal (at sunset its stunning) and be delightfully amused by boat traffic on both canals jousting at the intersection. and the cuisine matches the view. it has a french-bistro touch, with dutch food sourcing. on last visit, my wife and i opted for seafood completely. our seafood plate shared appetizer included lobster, shrimp, smoked eel spread and more. entrees were a generous portion of sauteed red snapper with whole, fresh carrots, potatoes and beets, and a deliciously poached serving of salmon on a puree of root vegetables. wine list is well represented, with pairings suggested on the menu. we lingered as long as we could with dessert wine just to watch boats glide by as dusk fell . . . more than a bit romantic!"
visited this charming little place together with my son to have lun 
"baarle nassau, always a nice town to go  "
"we opted for two hours which was more than enough, and was for both food and drinks, soft or alcoholic. loads of choice from chinese, thai, european already pre-prepared, plus an option to have your choice of fish or steak etc cooked to your liking in front of you. great dessert choice too!"
me family and friends are regulars here and we love the place. overall the food is great. the options are there and you can eat everything chinese food has on offer in here. it‚Äôs kids friendly and the staff are great
"it is the type of restaurant where you eat all you can. you pay a fee at the entrance and then everything you want to eat and drink is free. the food is very well prepared and you can choose also for wok or teppanyaki. they have a lot of choices. the staff is very friendly and they speak english, if you dont know dutch. "
"the price is quite cheap since you can drink for free . and the food is tasty,especially the beefsteak."
"la pergola is the only authentic italian restaurant in baarle-nassau. located on the chaamseweg, this is where to go if you want a tasty italian pizza. dont be mistaken by the cheap takeaway across the street. la pergola sits hidden in the back of a driveway, right behind a french restauran "
nice pancake house with 200+ types of pancakes available! staff is kind and there is care for details.
belgian waffle with strawberries was outstanding. calm location with a beautiful view on the two nearby churches
"if you love pancakes, this is your place. the service is fast with lot of choice. the restaurant is big and theres enough place in the terrace. but they do not have a menu on a different language.. only dutch !!"
"despite the core of the place are children, please do not be confused. it is not noisy and caotic. quite the oposite. is organised and the paste of the food is exelent. it has a wide variety of options and certanly you with or witout children will enjoy."
they had an enormous menu and i loved the pancakes. great hot chocolate too. the kitchen had just started up so the pancakes took a while to come but thats only because it wasnt lunch time yet. dont think you typically come in the morning for food but not too sure. it was fine though and good service. great atmosphere and lovely place. 
we came for the restaurant between the boarders but find this place. te staff was welcoming and very helpful. the food was amazing we took the greek and it was very good. the coffe was good too and the kids enjoyed the pancakes. they have kids play ro 
perfect as well as worth it place to visit with your family. provides a wide range of options for pancakes. kids are welcome to visit with a nice spot to play as well as get a gift. yum-yum packages will entertain your kids while you enjoying the foods.
"i was staying in baarle for a couple days and noticed that this place was more than just a breakfast spot. its in a perfect spot in the center of town! i sat down for dinner on the sidewalk and ordered a pizza pancake, which tasted just like a regular pizza!"
"of youre in baarle and youre hungry, go eat here. one of these will fill you right up. you can get a hearty pancake or some sweet one. there is also a room for the kids to play in. staff is very friendly."
"this restaurant is well worth it. they probably 100 pancakes, if not more, to choose out of. its very hard to make a decision "
"very nice restaurant, in small town. excellent atmosphere, cosy, good menu card. owner is very friendly and you feel at home at once."
"typical example of dutch gezellig, intimate. great service, nice food, recommended have been there a couple of times and will surely comeback."
we spotted it one day while on a bike ride to emmerlich and thought it looked nice. a couple of days later we were close and looking for a lunch stop so it was obvious to go ther 
"old village inn, nice building with old charm, friendly staff and prevenant. about meal, quickly served. about quality, the meal is dutch, typically dutch. being french people we cant judge. it was different but it was still good."
"we were sent here by our b&b hosts in nearby k√ªbaard. a pleasant country restaurant in a small village, obviously frequented by a lot of locals. we enjoyed the warm evening and lonf twilight outside. the lady serving us was of the senior staff, very friendly, and gave us good advice what to choose. the food was superb, the meat and fishcooked exactly as wished, but i must single out the french fries which were a dream! the best ones i ate on this long nw europe trip including belgium! highly recommended, worth a larger detour if in the provice of friesland!"
this place - depsite being relatively close to two moterways - is very tranquil and nicely situated on the waterfront. loads of activieties are organisaed closeby and the restaurant serves nice food and has really friendly staff.
we took a turn from the highway a50 and stopped at seeing the outside of watergoed. the parking area was secured and after entrance we sat down on the nice terrace in the many nice shadow spots. we drunk a local non alcoholic beer and ate a hamburger and a club sandwich which tasted very nice. the staff(very friendly and nice ladies üòâ) provided friendly service and were very patie 
"one of my favourites in the northern groningen area, this family-owned restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem for food lovers. small, intimate, and friendly, veldzicht serves excellent food using classic but often-overlooked ingredients (such as some rarely seen varieties of more well-known vegetables), mostly locally produced and all lovingly prepared. i have never regretted dining there, although there have been times ive regretted *not* dining there."
"we were a group of 14 travelers who unexpectedly needed a place at the last minute for lunch. our tour group leader checked trip advisor and called the owner of veldzicht and inquired about the possibility of bringing 14 tired and hungry travelers for lunch in a few hours and our leader had a limited budget. the owner was amazing! when we got to the restaurant, our group was greeted enthusiastically and the food was delicious! he had prepared a delicious steak, cooked to each persons taste, a fresh tasty salad and bowls of crisp french fries. we had our choice of drinks, beer, wine, etc. and a chocolate covered ice cream bar for dessert. he even provided a vegetarian option for 2 of our travelers. this is a family friendly restaurant, immaculate and comfortable with a small play area outside for children. we had just completed a river cruise and had fabulous meals for 2 weeks but i must say we all agreed that the lunch we were served rivaled any of the meals that had been served on our ship!"
"came as a family of four with two teenage kids. service was very good, food excellent, atmosphere very nice indeed. sometimes not many people are in and it is alittle flat. my only other comment is i only would like the owner (wife) to be a little more engaging with guest "
lovely cafe. we had lunch. terrific!! even glutenfree bread. friendly welcome aswell.  a nice feeling we got from this place.
"the restaurant is situated in the center of the picturesque village beusichem, 50 meters from the 14th century church. a great place to sit at the front or back terrace enjoying your drinks and a selection of their lunch or dinner menu with friends and family."
"in the centre of the small village beusichem, opposite to the church at the market plain, restaurant het heerenlogement is situated. from the former centuries it was an inn, amd styill it kept its hospitality. besides the dinner area it has two special rooms extra for small groups up to 12 persons, the menu is not large but has enough offers to get a good dinner served for every taste for normal prices. the service is great. this restaurant owns a theater which is used for artists. there are nice combinations with a performance and a buffet."
"situated in a beautiful historical village and building. f riendly staff, great price-quality dishes and wines."
"great service, a nice terrace outside to sit and enjoy a drink or something to eat. we had lunch salmon tartare broodje and i had the buffalo chicken broodje. very enjoyable."
caf√© middeloo is a nice place for a coffee or a lunch. you can eat a nice sat√© or a salade (and more). also they have a nice terras outside! great for a glass of wine at happy hour!
this place has the looks and feel of a real dutch bar. youll feel quite at ho

"very pleasant and welcoming. the dutch menu was explained to us and we selected a platter of typical dutch food that proved both fresh and palatable. very good coffee. we sat outside in comfortable seats and the experience was very pleasurable. the waitress was very attentive, cheerful and informative. we would return if we could. recommended. "
nice location with comfortable seating on the terrace. very good service with friendly staff. food served was delicious for both of us. would certainly recommend this restaurant for lunch or evening meal.
"broad varity of great pancakes, if you like you can also pick the toppings on your own. child- and dog-friendly. bit remote location but that is perfectly fine."
we had a family holiday in medemblik when we realized that it was the day the terraces were reopen 
they offer a wide variety of pancakes! you can also choose and combine different toppings on top of your natural pancake. the food are really delicious! the staff are also friendly and attentive. plus they give your little ones a surprise gift before leaving. highly recommended!
we stayed because of the camper stop but really loved the pancakes. we had one savoy as a meal and a sweet one each as a sna 
"since we were on our way back home from vacation, we wanted to eat one last pannenkoeken.  due to tripadvisor we picked this place.  the servants were friendly and quick.  our pannenkoeken were great! definitely a place to go."
"the best ramen in the netherlands! i love the tsukamen dipping style noodles, which take advantage of the delicious homemade noodles."
"visited yokohama ramen saito early june 2022. there was a short waiting time before we got seated, but it was not too long! we sat by the bar overlooking the busy kitchen. it was great seeing the whole staff in action. the food itself was authentic, full of bold flavors. with just one slurp of the noodles it brought me back straight to japan. we tried the salty and miso ramens, both absolutely delicious! it is well worth the trip to experience such amazing food!"
"we wanted to visit an authentic ramen serving restaurant, and search engines suggests this on "
"the very lovely waitress tells you everything you need to know about ramen, then you get a absolutely filling portion when ordering ‚Äûmedium‚Äú, you have to be veery hungry to go for the ‚Äûbig‚Äú. very tasty, quite hard to eat for a first-timer though, so don‚Äôt wear your best shirt may "
"literally the best ramen i‚Äôve ever tried. the staff is very nice, the food is just perfect. be careful, there‚Äôs always a lot of people and you could be waiting outside ‚ò∫Ô∏è. will definitely come again !"
"very surprised by this unique (in the netherlands) ramen store! had a very nice authentic tasting ramen, which really made me happy! the prices are low too! maybe even too low in my opinion! i hope i will get the chance to return soon!"
we love this place which is so simple and keeps true to the important things. homemade noodles made with the heart and served with a smile. also the tantan soup is a life saver for when getting a cold.  our favorite place in schiedam!!!
"the restaurant interior is basic, canteen/family style. the ramen are fresh and delicious. had tantanmen and its the best noodles i ever had in the netherlands. my friend had miso and that broth was perfect too! excellent service. does not serve alcohol but the 0% heineken was ok."
"for those people who have critic regarding this shop, you can lowest price ramen with deep broth that you cannot get at other ramen shop. he charges drinks 1.50 euro .. that is almost nothing compared to other shop who charges 2.75 .. if you have appreciation what he does, then you will enjoy his food more."
i usually come here at least 3/4 times a month with my bro 
"the ramen is the best in the rotterdam area. the restaurant is very casual, family style. good service, friendly staff and very good quality at low pricing."
"we went here on a recommendation from a friend. when we entered, the place was packed, and we were greeted but nobody told us what to do. we had to find out ourselves that we had to wait for a space to open up, and about 45 minutes later, it did. we had to sit together with other people, which was strange but not disruptiv "
"this is a very simple restaurant with no frills, which makes it an all the more interesting experience that its food is amazingly tasty and generous. we went in on a friday night and there was a line of people waiting. when we finally got a table we had some of the best ramen we ever had, at an amazing price."
"i come here every week, its my favorite place for ramen. you can customize your own ramen, more or less sauce, oil, or add more toppings. broth is delicious and noodles are home made of local ingredients. and with the price of only 9 euro you keep coming back to this place."
the ramen was sooooo tasty! we liked the broth and soft handmade noodles. we would really recommend you to go visit this ramen shop. the owner is so sweet nice cute and kind! üôèüèΩ
"i live in rotterdam but i‚Äôve been to schiedam especially to eat there more than once because it‚Äôs soooo good ! the miso soup is to die for, the broth is simply amazing! it‚Äôs a small restaurant and very good so you might have to wait for a table but it‚Äôs worth it ! the chef and the waiters/waitresses are also super nice ! "
love the food ‚ù§Ô∏è very authentic and great care is put into the cooking üçú!! come here very often with various friends and everyone has enjoyed the ramen and gyoza =] and also love the super friendly waitors and owner n_n! definitely a recommendation to come eat here!
authentic japane 
"we had the miso and soya ramen. the broth was so hearty and delicious. just the correct amount of everything. amazing unami. ramen itself is home made from local ingredients. the flavour is totally different from both. would definately come back. we went at 18.00. left at 19.00, there was a que of about 10 people when we left. the picture doesnt presents the dish well."
"love this place. i come here weekly or sometimes 2 per week! owner and personnel are very friendly!    they dont take reservations, just stop by and order your favorite ramen. highly highly recommend!"
great story on a true japanese speciality that settled in schiedam. authentic ramen noodles is what they serve and if you like this you should go here! the noodles themselves are made by schiedam produces flower which gives the story even more authenticity. i always take the miso! mind you there are more people that know about this so chances are you will have to wait for your table.
"came here with my friend on the day where everyone weares swim clothing (bikinis etc). felt comfortable, relaxed and safe aka no creeps over there. really great saunas and indoor pool. awesome day to just chill and talk with friends. food here is allright, but it is pricy. our entree was free( they sometimes have actions were you can go in for free, you only pay a swimwear fee of almost 9 euros)"
"really enjoyed this place. friendly staff, clean with lots of options. i would go back if im in the area."
"i visit this spa quite often, because it is close to my home (town). its well-maintained, clean and modern and you can choose from a lot of different saunas. there are some baths (apart from the larger swimming pool inside), but it would be great if there could be some more (hot tubs for instance). friendly staff. good food at the restaurant (salads are great). great garden."
i have had several lovely days here. the facilities are very good and also the card.  clean place and friendly stuff.
"i have visited this spa recently with the holiday deal 2 for 1. with the coupon (from their website), it is quite good in price (about 15‚Ç¨ p.p "
you can eat in this restaurant only when visiting sauna thermen holid 
"we have been to this spa as a couple and enjoyed it! the spa itself was quite new, probably renovated lately. they just forgot to renovate the 2 small pools outside.. i hope that this will be done as well soon, if so, i would make it a 5 star spa. the prizes are actually quite high, but for the netherlands and a spa this seems quite normal "
"we were in rotterdam in march, brrrrrr. so we went to the sauna in schiedam, very easy to reach by train from rotterdam central station. we spent a lovely evening going from sauna to sauna, trying the different atmospheres and bathing outside in a warm water pool while there was a snowstorm going on, that was great! the location is typical for many big saunas in holland: wedged between highways in an industrial zone but thats ok. tip: we arrived after 5 pm so the entry price was more than halved and thus very reasonable. tip: take your own gear (flip flops, towels and bathrobes) we did not try the restaurant. you should be at ease with being in the nude..."
"the saunas are great, lots of choice, the loly fanatstic but i dont understand why all the sauna-complexes in the netherlands have gone up in price lately "
it was a very pleasant restaurant and my friend was looking forward to trying thai food for the first time. the food was very good and the service was pleasant. the hardest thing was to choose what to eat as everything sounded good.
"nice small restaurant. owner and chef are friendly and welcoming. i had my normal thom kha kia and pad gapraow kai. they were both really good. not so spicy as normal, but good flavours."
i went to have dinner with my boyfriend and everything was really tasty and delicious. he ate duck and i ate prawns with red curry sauce. the food was so good that you could imagine yourself in thailand. i have been in several thai restaurants but i have to say that this is the best one i have ever tried in the netherlands. the waiter was really kind. we were talking to him and he was really nice explaining us from where the food come and the history of the restaurant. i strongly recommend this restaurant so if you are in schiedam it is worth going there to enjoy a delicious meal.
"we had dinner here last week. first time with new owners somchai and markus. we felt as if we were back in thailand, the chef prepared my favorite dish (nua nam tok) and we had several starters and khao pad. some of the dishes were cheaper than before, which was also a pleasant surprise. the taste of our dishes was just lovely and the nua nam tok was spicy like it should be üòä. will go back soon!! "
"very fresh and good thai food and good service.  the location is not the best,  but that is not most important.  very calm place.  maybe more people in the weekends."
great friendly service. took a while to choose what we wanted as there were so many options. our meals were delicious. lots of fresh veges and good sized portions. one of the best thai experiences i had out of thailand.
"with seven people nicely seated in the middle of the restaurant. food is good value for money, service of the crew friendly. good to find out they had juliper bier on draft ! next opportunity will return."
"i eat here regularly. the food is excellent. the vegetables are freshly cooked and just right. the staff is very friendly. i even brought some friends here who go to thailand often and they even ordered what was not on the menu, but no problem for them to prepare it."
"i have been to this restaurant several times for both dine in and takeaway orders, i have to say that this restaurant serves the best thai food i have ever tasted. the owner nui and his staff are warm and friendly and their attention to detail is second to no "
lovely building. very helpful staff and excellent food. the waitress was so helpful and explained points of interest and the menu to us.
"fascinating building (and yes, it is on a slant inside, its not you) now a library with fast free wifi, great service and a good selection of snacks, pastries, stronger drinks and fab coffee."
we stumbled across this place by accident as part of a sightseeing walk around schiedam. its a small caf√© as part of the main public library where you can sit inside and read whats on offer in the library or take a seat at a table outside. it was a very hot day so we took advantage of the outdoor seati 
"visiting this restaurant you will discover that cheape is not allways bat. in a more family like surrounding you can eat all kind off realy chinese food for a good price. don`t expect the most beautifull place but the food, service en kindness of the staff will surprise you. and believe me, we visit this restaurant allready for manny years."
"excellent italian restaurant, pizza with genuine ingredients. the owners are italian and cook very well, they are very kind. the dishes are real italian, with no dutch or touristic influences!"
very good and very professional! a very good place where have a nice meal with fresh recepies in the heart of schiedam
we had a warm welcome and we had a good dinner last friday. everyone in the company enjoyed their meal. i certainly want to go back when i go back to schiedam.
we ate here a few times whilst in schiedam for a business trip. it was exactly what we were looking for - good food for a reasonable price. the service was friendly and there was a nice atmosphere outside with views on to the square.
"every guest is welcomed by the owner, a nice and friendly person, i a way that you feel at home immediatly. the dishes are all very tastefull."
"we sat down at the terrace with the sun setting, looking for a nice dinne "
"dropped in for a spot of lunch and found an amazing italian. some of the best italian food ever had, despite living in milan for 10 years. very reasonable prices, fantastic service and a real passion form the owners to serve you great food with an open armed italian welcome. will be a regular now! thanks for a lovely welcome and fantastic food. "
"ive now dined here numerous times. a very simple restaurant, more cafe like at times but located overlooking one of the nicest parts of schiedam. the menu is simple but provides a good range of pasta and pizza. the recent addition of alcohol has certainly added to the appeal with italian beers and wines now available. dining is best outside people watching the beautiful square. upstairs is not so pleasant but downstairs allows you to see the wonderful owner organise her staff. the service can be a little slow at times but is always friendly. and the food is fabulous. fantastic pizzas and pasta. proper home style cooking full of flavour and at very reasonable prices. my favourite place to eat in schiedam for a relaxed, flavourful and friendly meal. grazie mille. "
"after i left italy it was hard to find a real good italian restaurant in the netherlands. cotto e mangiato is a rare place where you can get a real italian food, great quality and fine prices."
"very recommendable italian restaurant, we had a dinner and we ordered different types of pizzas. the ingredients were very tasty and the dough well cooked! to drink, they have a variety of natural juices which are very recommendable too."
cotto en mangiato is a combination of deli and (lunch)restaurant. i have lunch here regular 
tasty food great serv 
"it was $22.50 for each one, little expensive but worth it. the food was delicious, the menu has different choices for the tapas even for vegetarians. i will come back for sure!"
i enjoyed my meal at curry corn 
looking for some nice food and came across this restaurant whilst walking. the food was very good. very tasty and more than generous portions. service was also excellent. definitely worth a visit if you happen to be on the area.
"i have already been here a few times and i have never been disappointed, best dal eve and best indian restaurant in all of the netherlands if you ask me!"
was a nice experience to be here. very good service and food. the restaurant flair and music make a good harmonious impression.
"delivered right on time, the flavours were really good. all tasted very well, and with plenty of variety. compliment to the chef!"
"nice restaurant, very friendly people. nice food. very tasty, original, fresh what i can say go there and enjoy"
really great food!! loved the service! one of the best indian food restaurants! the chicken tikka masala is must have!
"as an english guy brought up on a diet of curry, this small restaurant made a good impression. the rogan josh was spicy & tangy with a tasty tomato sauce; the nan bread was hot and fluffy and the basmati rice wasnt a sticky gloop. my brother-in-laws madras was good and hot in a rich sauce and the lamb was good quality (though not very much of i "
"i bought a groupon voucher for a set menu in schiedam, near rotterd "
went there several times before with friend and the food is very go 
"having been slightly dubious about the potential quality of what appears to be schiedams only indian restaurant, i can confidentially say ive found a new regular haunt. a large group of us arrived at 9pm on a tuesday evening to a very quiet restaurant. a warm welcome from what presumably was the owner lead to us all being seated around a long table central to the spacious restaurant. the menu is very typical for most indian restaurants around the world, following a lot of anglo-indian conventions. even the indian lager brewed in the midlands (of england) leant itself to the british indian restaurant feel. a variety of dishes were ordered from byriani to dopiaza to jalfrezi. the food arrived and provoked much promise from the aromas that greeted us. much satisfied eating ensued and we all agreed that a return visit would most definitely be arranged. the service was relaxed but friendly and the waiter/owner was very accommodating. my request for chapati resulted in the provision of some roti that wasnt on the menu but quickly produced. a return visit the following week produced a similarly positive experience added to by the very charming waitress. "
"we were here via an invitation from an indian family member. the tandoori chicken was cooked in perfection, tender, juicy and yummy! i personally enjoyed the lamb curry dish too, the taste lingers in my mouth. afterall the kitchen did a very good job in mastering the exotic indian flavours, however the service could be improved. due to the shortage of waitress, we had to wait quite long for the service. "
"i went here with my mother a couple of months ago. rather than us each picking one dish, we had some soup and shared a variety of side dishes and rice. it was very tast "
we visited to tour the windmill and we had a slice of delicous apple pie and coffee. the tour was very informative and the pie was delicious! the fields surrounding the area was beautiful. it had just stopped raining and the sun was begining to shine and everything was still wet...otherwise i would have loved to sit outside at the cute tables on the terrace...i could just imagine spending an afternoon sitting out there sipping coffee and reading a good book! lovely setting and i loved learning about the history of the windmill and how the wooden mechanisms work! fascinating!
every year i go back to this restaurant. it has a wonderful terrace with a beautiful view. you may see some storks if you are lucky. the windmill is amazing to 
this was a very nice stop in a beautiful area. we came on the bikes and ordered croquettes with bread etc. an afflingen and a wiecks rose and we were very happy and satisfied.
"i enjoyed both lunch and dinner at this restaurant. the service was excellent, and the food very good. the salads were large, and the salmon with the famous dutch asparagus delicious. we dined outside on the large terrace. the view is wonderful! i even spotted two stork "
"we stayed close in millingen and found this restaurant during the trip there and decided to eat here.  very cosy modern restaurant and friendly staff.  food, drinks and coffee were very good."
this very beautiful restaurant in the middle of wide landscape flatland of the ooij polderpop serves a nice variaty of breakfasts and lunch 
"this restaurant has improved greatly since its opening a few years ago. i enjoyed several lunches outside on the large terrace. the first time i enjoyed a hamburger, and the second time i ordered the vitello tonnato on home made bread. the portions were large and the food delicious. the service was fast and friendly. i will return to this restaurant. i love the setting, the view and the food! "
"walking from the hampshire hotel in berg en dal along the duivelsberg to persingen en zyfflich and return we took a little lunch at this amazing pretty place. it was a sunny day so we found a table on the cosy terrace with view over the fields and hills of berg en dal and reichswald. 5/5. we choose the calamaris 5/5, apple pie with cream 4/5, hot chocolate with cream 4/5. the service was friendly and efficient 5/5. price performance 5/5. a good place to relax and the menu looked very inviting for a dinner too."
"nice view, easy to get to by car or bike.  the sandwiches are very dutch and are good.  the asparagus soup is the best i ever had."
burger and ribs me and my friend had food was lovely and it in a beautiful location i would defo call for food here again
good quality fastfood like fries etc. much better then the average fastfood chain. also good sandwiches if you want something more healty.
"it is not far from the spots we visited, the old cityhall and the church. few steps away youll be there.  food were good and the place is cozy, clean and with friendly staff."
"on a rainy summer sunday we visited the lovely village of de rijp and found ourselves hungry and looking at this place. we had already decided we wanted pancakes (proper dutch ones, that is, not crepes) and had been prepared to drive away from de rijp for that. we entered and sat ourselves down and ordered pancakes of various varieties, including with bacon and with apple (spekpannekoek, appelpannekoek). they even catered for one of the five of us who wanted a appelspekpannekoek which wasnt on the menu. our pancakes arrived and we truly enjoyed them. tasting as they used to, not a microwave in sight of course. the right balance between crispiness and soft, with good amounts of filling (whether bacon, apple or both). service was quick (but not too quick, you cannot hurry a pancake) and very friendly. good memories. better than most other pancakes i have had in the past few years."
"the restaurant is simple but effective. the service is friendly, fast and personal.if you are in de rijp and readyfor lunch, this is the place to go. the sandwich with old beemster cheese should not be missed. take away is possible and the have free wifi."
over the last weeks i visited inkies twice and on both occassions the quality of the 3 course dinner was excellent. definitely worthwhile to travel a bit further
"we were truly positively surprised on the quality of the food and the service. some small improvements are possible but for us close to 5 star. restaurant is by far best we have visited around the leek area. nice ambianve and terrace, great on a warm day. we will be back"

we always enjoy eating at the stationskoffiehuis. the staff is very friendly and the food is good! besides it is always good to meet friends and enjoy the place outside.
the food here is excellent . they were exceptionally accommodating towards the children .  staff were friendly and efficient and could explain everything to us in english .  top quality food.  we will be back
a special evening with a walking dinner for 50 people. we loved the glaze on the bavette. simple dishes well prepared. next time we will try the menu.
this is a no frills eating house with very good food. the steak i had was the best i have eaten on the dutch side of the belgian/ dutch border. there is an outside terrace if the sun is shining.
"went here for dinner with the extended family. attentive staff, nice menu, good choice in beverages. the only negative thing was that they were probably understaffed this particular night, so it took quite long between courses."
"we had a private room booked for an event, and got to spend all day there. we snacks, lunch and dinner at the restaurant, and everything was yummy! personal favorites: the deep fried shrimp from the snack board, and the chili scampi dish i had for dinne "
"the service was absolutely wonderful!! the food even topped that. as a buger lover, this was by the best buger i have had in the netherlands ......."
"like the atmosphere. typical place you visit in a private setting with family and/or friends. simple menu, great choice of good quality beers and reasonably price "
"this is a restaurant i always like to visit when i come to valkenswaard. formerly the kakelbont pancake house, t brabants genot, has kept the good comfort food and added some new dishes, including wild game when in seas "
"out to get a pancake with the visiting fam, pheazantly surprised to see game on the menu! so a wild ragout pancake.... absolutely delicious. booked the wild proeverij 8-course meal on 24th november. looking forward to that. anyway, always a good eat at brabants genot, pleasant and attentive service and relaxed atmosphere."
"we had lunch for 30 family and friends to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. we used to live in netherlands so this was an ideal venue to meet with our dutch friends and our extended family who came here from the uk for a short holiday in de kempervennen, westerhoven. very friendly and efficient service and a good choice of food, especially pannenkoeken! impressed by the choice of local, seasonal beers (bokbieren van t vat). very child-friendly with good play areas both inside and outside. suited our 8 grandchildren aged 3 to 15 very well and staff very friendly to them. thanks especially to guus for her patience and ability to get all the orders right. overall a very good experience. for cyclists this venue is readily accessible via many good cycle routes."
we had lunch for a gathering of about 25 including children. the service and food were very good. the whole restaurant is very child friendly.
"i ate there twice, both times i enjoyed the salads i ordered. they had a very nice beer once. if you have children this is a nice place to be as they have a play ground."
had a business lunch and was offered a quiet place in the restaurant. great salads! quick and discreet service.
"great food, large portions for a small price. owner seemed really friendly and service was tip top. lovely terrace to spend an afternoon in the sun as well."
"when you look for good and tasty food in the best value for money setting available, make sure to go to hoom. burgers, salads, satay and my personal favorite ‚Äòossenhaas hoom‚Äô will make you come back for more. the food is fresh, well flavored, no complaints at all in view of quantity at your plate. make sure you have the home made ravigote sauce with your french fri "
"great hospitality, good value for money. we had a lovely family lunch. especially the service was worth singling out for its flexibility, friendliness and professionalism. we felt treated as guests."
"we come here already for a few years eating a business lunch or closing the year by having lunch just before christmas with colleagues. the food is of very good quality and the portions are huge. every year it surprises me that the service is slow. the time it takes before they come to you to take your orders is just too long. even if you asked to be served, it still takes them a while to finally come to you. part of the reason is that it is always busy other part is that it looks like they did not divide up the restaurant in sections. anyhow, we will be back calculating some extra time before our next scheduled meeting. or, we try to order by phone at the time of reservation; if at all possible."
"i am not a vegetarian but they serve a pasta that is to die for. my brother-in-law is and he says the vegetarian pasta is the best he has ever had. all their other dishes are superb. when we visit i always have this dish and save some to take home. however, the service is very slow but worth the wait. as a party of five we came in without a reservation and they accommodated us."
"we had both lunch and evening meals here. friendly, helpful with tasty food. try the hot stone steak - a speciality of the house"
"this is one of the few pubs we have in breukelen. it is run by a no nonsense family. very informal, and be prepared to meet with the local crowd. theyre happy to share their opinions with you. the menu is great if you like meat--which i do. "
"had drinks here with friends. friendly staff. music not too loud, easy to converse with each other. location on this center of town street is perfect."
"good food, nice people, good drinks. overall guests are middle age and up. good atmosphere. centre of brooklyn big terras."
"the regthuys in breukelen is a nice cafe in the center of breukelen. you have always same friendly people working there so after a few visits one knows another. the food is perfectly what you can expect from a cafe like this, may be even better. there is a nice variety and the price/quality is excellent. i would really recommend to stop by for a drink or an uncomlicated dining experience."
very helpful waiter served us lovely icecream and coffee! lovely stop and no smokers near us üëçüèºüëçüèº
"we only had a drink and an ice cream at the brasserie. but they advertised all main dishes at 10 ‚Ç¨, which sounded interesting. (but already had other plans for dinner)  staff was very friendly. would definitely go passed there again, if in the neighborhood."
we were on a bicycle trip from brugges to amsterdam and we stopped in breukelen on market day for a coffee on market day. we sat down to watch the day and have a break. we sat outside in a sunny da 
"i have been coming here since it opened and never had a complaint (except when they take flammkuchen off the menu haha). the service is great, nice to sit on the terrace and watch the boats go by."
"situated next to the son marina is this cosy restaurant with a simple but effective menu. especially when the weather allows sitting outside and there is activity on the water, this is a great place to have lunch and/or afternoon drinks. you forget time and just sit and watch. what a great way to spend an afternoon!"
"nice food, with the interesting theme of tapas (if you wish). atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, food tastes good and itll was a nice experience for us, but not extraordinary. might go back for a convenient dinner..."
"we go regularly to rozer in son and almost always choose from the long list of tapas dishes. sometimes 5 each, sometimes 13 or 15 in total. selection is always hard: they are all nice and different. the house wine (red) is ok and, just as everything, very reasonably priced. we have dinner for about ‚Ç¨40 in total and walk away happy and well-f "
"good menu and food, served well. good waitress and other staff. food was good value. the place was very friendly and a pleasand surroundings."
"we have been many times in this beautiful restaurant and appreciate a nice indonesian restaurant in town. the place is nicely decorated and gives space to dine. especially the fresh tables cloths give an atmosphere of luxury and dedication. the menu and food created is absolutely good, a bit salty, but dedicated indonesian and consistent through time. prices are very reasonable for the quality served. although allreally very good, how nice if the taste could be even brought up, closer to the original indonesian levelüòâüëç"
"been here many times now and the quality is consistent and good. the restaurant has nice clean table sheets, good modern atmosphere and the food is offering a wide range of dishes and menus. price and portions are really good. keeping up the quality and seeking and dearing to adhere to tru indonesian flavors will be the challenge."
"from the outside scheiwijk looks like an ordinary gas station, but inside the place is full of deli food, gourmet coffee and other good stuff. the staff is extremely friend "
scheiwijk is een excellent concept just for a quick break along the highway. the served food is excellent and a wide range of very nice local ingredients.
"my last visit was a heavenly d√©j√†-vu experience from the previous visit: homemade exquisite sandwiches with a touch of dutch, german, indonesian and japanese specialities and regional products. this is not just a gas station, it is a place of rest and enjoyment with people who know how to make a difference."
"i discovered this venue years ago, when coming back from amsterdam (it is approx 60 km from there, on the a 27, only southwards). i have been back ever since... and hearing foreign visitors and reading the reviews on ta i am surely not the only one to appreciate their reputati "
"we stopped here yesterday, on the way back from amsterdam to the channel tunnel. its the second time, having stopped there last summer on the same journey. its a fairly unremarkable site, compared to a lot of the huge dutch service stations but unique. a range of fresh food, ready made items, craft drinks and gifts all come together into a cool little stopping point for a break. only thing worth remembering is 50 eurocents for the toilets. i normally grumble about this but theirs are spotless and look like an architect designed them. it all adds to the experience, as a result!"
gas station with a rustic feel and many home made delicacies. we had a whole wheat panini with meat in peanut sauce. then bought a glass of peanut butter with chili peppers.... :)
this unremarkable little esso petrol station is hiding a secre 
was on a european business trip and had dinner on a saturday night with my daughter in my father‚Äôs home village. food was excellent and good sized portions. loved the bitterballen as an app. friendly staff and atmosphere. love to return in the summer and enjoy sitting beside the rotte. thank you ‚Äòt zeeltje hope to return.
"nice located restaurant with many tables inside (and firepit!) and outside on the terrace. beautiful view over the lake. the service is friendly and fast, the dishes well proportioned. a recommendation for family of business occasions!"
"the restaurant is located near a lake, and has some great food to offer. the meat is just perfectly grilled! the food is served with salads and fries. take the dame blanch as a desert! its great!"
"we have going to this restaurant for 5 years now and we are still very happy about the quality of the food. the ambiance is romantic and is perfect for a nice date. the service is friendly and welcoming. pasta, pizza and meat all dishes great taste and specially the dessert tiramisu."
nice italian family serving good price-quality italian food. lots of pizza and pasta choices. dine in restaurant or pizza delivery are both good. no outside terrace and delivery is sometimes slow... will come back often.
"lovely place for coffee/tea. traditional little place with delicacies, all fresh made. comes with real hospitality and service with a smile"
very good coffee and a somewhere typically dutch atmosphere. i love it even the weather was not the best.
"during september and i have been several times there.  the coffee is excellent. no matter if you choose normal coffee, cappuccino or irish coffee.  outside there is a covered terrace with  fire bowl. very copy."
"we ate dinner with 6 adults and a child, and even with two pregnant women, everything served was scarfed up and really yummy. service was great, and they handled all our requests warmly and efficiently. highly recommended!"
"the perfect place for high quality lunch and dinner. fresh qualityfood and the best service ever.  in the city of old rijswijk, near the city. very wide assortiment beers and wines.  you shoud pay a visit"
"when i am in rijswijk i always have a coffee there.  on the warm days it is nice to outside.  they also offer food. however,  i didnt tried up to now.  very friendly staff."
i have been in two caf√©s at one day.  this caf√© has have had the better cappuccino.  the staff is very friendly.
this is a nice place for a short break between shopping.  there were some tables ourside and the sun was shining.  the cappuccino was good and the service fast.
"busy nice little shop with gluten, vegan and other died options!! worth a visit if your in the area friendly staff!"
i have visited this caf√© after some shopping.   unfortunately i have had only time for cappuccino as the menue looked promising.  the cappuccino has been excellent. i will definitely return.
"stopped and sat in the sun for a while, lovely pavement cafe.  salad bowl with falafel was very nice.  i didnt have cake but nearby tables did and looked impressive.  friendly staff."
"the interior decoration could be touched up a bit, to give it more warmth, deeper colors, browns. but that does nothing to the use of fine coffee ingredients. wed go here again!"
"wonderful atmosphere, splendid service, very friendly and patient, the cook came by and chat with us, loved the d√∂ner chicken special. would definitely recommend to anyone visiting this city ‚ù§"
cozy place with delicios dutch food. the special pancake was the best one. really nice staff and it‚Äôs affordable. worth a visit!
"very cozy shop with warm and friendly staff. traditional dutch pancake and i ordered the natural one with egg and oude cheese, it smells and tastes super. only that the portion is so big, so i need to take away! definitely worth trying! :)"
this spot is a gem! it is a small little restaurant where you can eat savoury and sweet pancakes - and they are delicious. we went on a saturday at lunch time and had a very nice spot to sit. the waitress was really nice and let us feel very welcome. i strongly recommend you going there.
very friendly staff. the pannenkoeken was really good. very good enviroment.  i went with my nephew and she loved the food too.  i would recommend everybody to try üòä
"delicious pancakes, one of the best ive tried. rich and varied menu with lots of options. first time im trying dutch pancakes, i tried the apple and bacon pancake as well as the poffertjes. the owner is super warm and kind. cozy place with plants and chill music. totally recommend this place to eat pancakes!"
"we loved this place! friendly and helpful staff, great (large!) pancakes and a lovely atmosphere. we were here with three children and there was plenty of space for them and drawing activities to entertain them. thanks for a lovely evening out as part of our long weekend trip from uk! "
"the pancakes are huge, delicious and the service wonderful. you can really tell the care and want you to enjoy yourself! highly recommend!"
"stopped in for dinner. food was wonderful, service attentive and quick. the next day we returned for the poffertjes (only offered on weekends until 5pm). we recommend you make this a stop if you are in the area."
"this is the kind of place that makes you feel like family the moment you walk through the door. our dutch isnt great but the staff were really happy to help us in english, which was really appreciated as they explained the complicated special so we were able to order and really enjoy it! our child was really well looked after and he really enjoyed his decorate-your-own pancake (small warning: it comes with a lot of hagelslag/sprinkles, though im sure they would give you less if you asked)"
"i was there twice and will definitely visit that place again. first time i got an uitsmijter pannenkoek with cheese and beacon. it was given with some sweet chili sauce. in addition, they suggested me another ananas sauce. it was also sweet and tasty. overall it was a good match: fueling big pancake and sweet sauces. i was not able to finish a whole pancake at once and took left part away with me. second time they suggested me their specials of the day, i tried one. it was pancake with plums, cottage cheese, walnuts and cinnamon. so yummy! very pleasant pancake. now i am eager to taste what else they hav "
visited as a family. both kids loved their pancakes. special unicorn shaped pancake for youngest with bowls of ingredients to personalise. veggie pancake catered for. special touch was chef patron coming out of kitchen to ensure we were having a great meal.
"absolutely delicious. great ambiance, excellent service, personal attention.  thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  highly recommend"
excellent pannekoeken. it does not matter if you ro decide for sweat or savory. all ate excellent. moderate priced. excelkent staff.
"best poffertjes in the netherlands. amazing service, super friendly! we will come back soon for sure!üôèüèª"
"not the only are the pancakes special, but the owner is very kind and friendly. the pancakes you get are cooked with ‚ù§"
"a true dutch treat. after living in the netherlands for many years i can say these are the best dutch pancakes we have had. the owner is very friendly. the ingredients are all local, like the flour which is sourced from an old windmill in the area. the recipe for the pancakes has been specially developed by the owner. whether you like a sweet or savory version of the pannenkoek they are all very tast "
it is an amazing place with delicious food and really good service. i went for lunch and that was a great experience. totally recommended.
delicious food and wonderful service. lovely outside area and activities (coloring in and play kitchen) for kids.
this restaurant makes the best pannekoeken in rijswijk.   i have been there a few times and has been always satisfied.
"during our stay in the netherlands we wanted to taste pancakes and poffertjes (dutch mini pancakes). we chose de pannenkoeken club and it was the best choice we could make. both pancakes and poffertjes were delicious! both the owners and staff were very nice and kind! the restaurant is located several steps from the tram station on the way between the hague and delft. if you want to taste delicious pancakes and poffertjes, we do recommend this restaurant!"
"nice, quiet family run business. great pancakes and wonderful service! im on a vacation trip to see friends and i recommend it!"
really excellent pancakes. the staff was very friendly. all in all excellent service. i will visit this place soon again.
"extremely delicious pancakes, good atmosphere and amazing staff! also, one of the very few kids friendly restaurants in rijswijk. our family loved it and therefore we highly recommend it!"
we had the best pannekoek and poffertjies here. the hospitality was great and we got to meet a fellow south african!  highly recommended for quality pancakes in all varieties thinkable....
"very friendly host, lovely pancakes, typical dutch, relaxed, cosy restaurant, fairly priced. will definitaly come here again."
"have been eating in here , very nice food, in a historic setting. before eating we had a few drinks in the bar and outside the restaurant in front off the place. they serve a lot off food meat, fisch and vegetarian. the service was good and friendly."
"my daughter moved to rijswijk 4 years ago so we visit quite regularly. her partner comes from rijswijk and ouds nest is a family favourite. we have been around 5 times so far. in earlier years the food was solid if not spectacular. lest year, with new owners it stepped up several rungs to a very friendly and pleasent evening with very good food. as we english both the owners son and daughter who were waiting on chatted about wanting to go to england and why had my daughter move to holla "
very good food and modest pricing ! location is for me very memorable because it is close to the werve that once belonged to shell and were  my family spent such great moments
"picked this out because i always like to eat local food wherever i go. i wasnt disappointed here. picking semi randomly from the dutch menu i ended started with a small egg salad (quail?) followed by a lamb ragout(?) with chips (mayo), surprisingly, potato wedges too, salad and a cabbage/smoked ham ensemble. all absolutely delicious. bottled beers here are great too. the owner is happy and friendly to this accidental tourist."
"another good meal at t nest, cafe pleasantly located in an old building with a couple of restaurant annexes close to the te werve estate in rijswijk. veal liver with onions, bacon and apple expertly cooked, mixed grill with beef, pork and chicken well prepared with quality meat. good garni with fried potatoes and french fries. sauces a little bit sub standard, tasted like they came from a package. good quality coffee, generous creme brulee and a nice red housewine (carmenere and also other choices). chilled pink port was delicious. will definitely return."
"the location is great - very old building, a lot of history. food is decently cooked, but the choice is limited. also serves as a very decent pub, and it has a great garden in the back, and a nice terrace in front - great for summer evenings!"
"pub/restaurant in traditional dutch style with the friendliest staff you can imagine. terraces in front, at the side and in the rear give you a choice for sun or shade. the whole inn gives the impression that you would not be surprised to see a stagecoach stopping to take on passengers. not too complicated a menu but its altered regularly with seasonal items. fixed items on the menu are fresh fish always or like now, early september, mussels and chips. goes wonderful with a salad. there is a smaller snacks-like card for lunch and afternoon e.g. with a meatball, hamburger or a large (dutch type) pancake cheese, bacon, syrup et "
"the nest is a long-standing rijswijk landmark, where staff treat the regulars like friends or even family! the food is good, the ambience is great, and the music is comfortable. definitely the place to be come football-season!"
"this is the combination of a dutch cafe (bruin cafe) with a restaurant in the back in a somewhat historic building (dated 1702). the food is solid dutch restaurant food. i particularly enjoyed the liver, it is not that easy to get well prepared liver anymore in restaurants. but they also serve many other more mainstream dishes."
"located near the te werve park this dutch restaurant ofters a real dutch experience. the staff speak little, but enough, english and there are no english menus. dont let that stop you. every dish on the menu is great. the kabeljauw - cod - is wonderful and the ribs never fail to please. the restaurant is in the back of the building with the bar in front. on warm days there is outside eating. the dining area looks like an older home and has a warm homey feel. the house wine is ok and a good price. we have never had dessert because we are always full after the main meal."
"when in rijswijk, for indonesian take-away food there is fierce competition between pasar makan and toko kediri. both offer excellent meals and have their fans, but we keep returning to pasar makan for their authentic flavours and friendly smiles. when take-away and eat-at-home is not possible for you, the restaurant offers a limited number of seats. however reservation is a must (especially in the weekends) as the place is extremely popular! you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes, try the dish-of-the-day if you are unsure or just ask the staff!"
what a wonderful little gem hidden in rijswijk. we called into this restaurant owned by gina and frans on a cold december saturday. the welcome was warm and the food was truly warming. a large number of local residents either called in for lunch or for a take away. the restaurant also sells a number of dry indonesian food goods including my favourite emping. 
for more then 15 years i come here to either take away or din 
pasar makan is conveniently located close to the (old) heart of rijswijk. parking space is available but not plentiful. it is a casual restaurant with a good variety of indonesian food which you can order by the plate. staff are very friendly and prices are acceptable. will return.
nice and fresh the best food i ever taste food like this restaurant. its great environment too.highly recommended
"very nice indian cuisine restaurant, the food is very  good and full of flavour. the setting inside and out is very nice ."
one of the best dinner via thuisbezorg we had in the last years. we took different dishes and all were tasty. great portions‚Ä¶we‚Äôll definitely go to the restaurant one evening since we enjoyed it so much
"i had a nice evening at little nepal. i was there with some friends and colleagues. the service was great and the food tasted really yummy. we ordered momo, chicken tikka biryani, green chilli chicken tikka masala, chicken tikka grilled. the food is reasonably priced and the nepali tune they play in the background is also very pleasant. recommend it highly."
we were three and have been satisfied all. the food is really nice and the service is also very good.
nice authentic restaurant with very good food.   every was very tasty and nicely arranged.  this evening only 3 tables were occupied.  very friendly and competend staff.
the food was very healthy and good in tast 
i have traveled quite a lot in europe and this is the best restaurant for me when it comes to nepalese dishe 
this restaurant serves delicious traditional nepalese food. the couple who runs the restaurant is very friendly and provides great service. the prices are low for the great food you get.
"i often go to little nepal to enjoy great food and hospitality. the food is delicious, reasonably priced and the couple who run the restaurant are very friendly. they are very open to cater your needs and changes you might need in the menu (including the desired spicy level). you can also enjoy authentic nepali tunes with the food. must haves are: momos, chicken tikka biryani, sweet lassi."
ive been visiting this restaurant for nigh on ten years because of the excellent quality of both the food and the hospitality of the own 
per accident  i have found this nice restaurant when i have been walking from old rijswijk to the direction of tram  
"as other reviewers mentioned, theres nothing special about the look of the restaurant. its basically a neighbourhood restaurant, somewhat dark and with a few tables. the food, however, is excellent. the service, even if a little slow, was extremely welcoming; our server went as far as going to the kitchen to find their recipe for a dish we loved (the paneer tikka). highly recommended."
the place does not seem very attractive at first sight but the quality of the dishes is really high. the only con is the time you wait but when you taste the food you understand that it us cook at the moment. really recommended
went here after walking around the area.  we made a reservation also.  food was absolutely fabulous!  not too spicy (but i love spicy food).  even the hottest thing on the menu was not hot (ask to have it made the way the cooks eat it).
i wanted to try this place at my friends suggestion. so ordered from a delivery service (thuisbezor 
went here with friends. food was good and our server was very friendly. nice little restaurant with good prices.
"the restaurant has good food, but not particularly raving. but what can you expect because it is not too expensive. and that makes it attractive. good food for average price. the big problem is too find a parking place."
"i m also chef cook and quality of food was fresh and perfect,and service was top.locatation of the restaurent is perfect.you can park your car in front of restaurent,with out any cost.just go and try then you know about it."
delicious food. we have been here with family. the taste is great and the price is normal of even cheap. the service is very friendly.
"we went there with a few colleagues for diner and were agreably surprised by the quality of the food and service. i must say that due to my lack of knowledge of the nepalese food i found it quite similar to indian food and equally delicious. word of advice: avoid the vindaloo as it was wickedly hot, even for my trained taste buds. definitely going back!"
"no matter what you pick its going to be delicious. we like to try new things so we pick one new thing every time, and its the kind of place where something new is a good surprise every time."
"delicious food,we have eaten  here for the first time....and it was great taste. the service was attentive. the decor was also very nice simple in design. it was great experience to be at little nepal. we will come back  :) :)."
"the food is great for affordable prices but the restaurant would need a serious make-over if not a full renovation. i confirm that although the service is very friendly, it is also quite slow."
"great food, excellent service, low prices. our waitress was very hospitable and went out of her way to customize our meals with suggestions and alternative (side) dishes that were not on the menu. the flavours of the individual dishes were distinct and complemented each other. prices were very reasonable (25 euro for three courses). only possible downside:we were there on a slow night (4 tables) and had to wait for 40 minutes for our main course; wondering what will happen on a busy night....."
"excellent food, authentic still, and very friendly. small and cosy restaurant, simple place, but very good choice of food and specialities for all tests."
"i have been to this restaurant twice, first time with my friends and second with one of my dutch colleagues. the food is delicious, and people are really nice. my only complain is that the momo was not as good as i though it would be to impress my dutch friend "
love the typically nepalese mix of indian and chinese food here. sometimes you have to wait a while before you get your food.
"love indian food and little nepal is the closest indian restaurant to my home. been eating here for about three years and never had a bad meal. all the usual indian standards are on offer along with a few nepalese dishes. the quality of the food is great, though if you have been brought up on uk indian food, its best to order the dishes a little hotter than normal. the service is very friendly but extremely slow. all the food is cooked to order, so be prepared to sit and chat between courses - not the place to visit if you are in a hurry. cost, including a couple of drinks is about eur 30 per head"
"we went to indrapura on the day they re-opened after the corona lockdown. they had been closed for months and somehow the kitchen could not cope with demand. many tables had ordered dinner around 6 pm and it took a long time for our meal to be served. after more than an hour our dinner arrived and we were starving. all the dishes were excellent so we were more than happy with the food. faster service would have resulted in a 5 star rating. waiting for your order is ok, half an hour, fourty minutes maybe, but an hour is too long. our server was excellent and so was the food."
nice restaurant with the typical dutch combination of indonesian food.  we were three and nearly the only guest ( except one other table).  there was enough space.  the food was good and the staff friendly.
i have been there a few times during the last years. most of the times i ordered something to take away.  the food is quite good but nothing special.  the service is fast and friendly.
"indonesian restaurant indrapura is getting more and more popular and thats well deserved. the food is always very good, the service is friendly and professional and the service is not toot fast or too slow, just right the is always enough parking space nearby, but parking is not entirely free. iss free for the first 2 hours, so in the end you pay little or nothing for parking, depending on the length of your stay. there is little. today we had the 4 course surprise menu, which was very nice. we got 2 kinds of kroepoek (prawn crackers), next we got a combo of soempia, loempia and sesame balls, then 3 kinds of sate, then 2 meat dishes (duck and goat) and a fish dish (surimi and prawns), with rice (there was a choice of fried rice, boiled white rice, or noodles). then a choice of 3 deserts. when we ordered, we were asked about our preference for fish and/or meat, so they will adapt the menu to your taste. altogether a very good meal and a pleasant experience. we will be back!."
"the food was nice and prepared with  care, but the portions were too little. maybe that is to be expected if you go through ticketveiling.nl.maybe my expectations were unrealistic. staff was very friendly."
"indrapura is not in the city center, which makes it less likely to attract a lot of tourists. the advantage is that there is lots of free parking nearby. in the restaurant we were welcomed by 2 ladies who were very attentive and served us very well. we had a rijsttafel consisting of many dishes, all of which were very nice, with authentic indonesian flavours. as we were celebrating a birthday, we sang happy bithday and when we left, the birthday girl who was celebrating her 83rd birthday, was given a small present by the waitress. a very nice gesture! lovely food, service, atmosphere, all at a fair price. we will be back! "
"forget all the others, if you want to taste good chinese food, and even good indonesian food go here. for over 40 years (i am not that old) this restaurant serves it‚Äôs costumers the best food there is"
nice location with good fo 
we went there for a business lunch. it was an interesting experience. good quality and service and very nice location. free parking just in front of the door. to come back again.
"beste chinees in nederland. lekker ouderwets chinezen.  this is the best chinese restaurant in the netherlands, and the indische rijstafel is really good too!"
"it has been a couple of years since i last ate at the golden house, so decided to pay them a visit. as other reviewers have mentioned, this is a pretty large restaurant and is quite often very full at weekends ‚Äì seems to be a favourite with famili "
"this relatively spacious restaurant offers comfortable seats that are not packed together. its a great place for having conversations because of the discrete atmosphere. the food however is not that special, just the regular chinese cook without anything remarkable. including the somewhat above-average price in our judgment, it adds up to a mere 4 stars. i may visit here again to chat and catch up with friends, or for a drink while doing some work on the laptop, but not particularly for the menu."
"on a thursday night i went here for some take away food for two persons. i had some sat√© ayam, mihoen goreng with chicken and foe yong hai with chicken. all tasted good, especially the sat√©. the portions are big so it is possible to eat it in two days or with more than two persons. the restaurant was crowded on that thursday night, has a huge menu and looked good from the inside. we paid 24 euros which is a fair price. i will be back here!"
in corona times it is great to be still able to takeaway the superb daily indonesian dish at tjendrawasih. very hygienic service and required distance properly adhered to. food very tasty and great to consume at home with some krupuk and a beer.
"various indonesian rijsttafels , sateh gambing is excellent.....friendly staff....everyone enjoyed it very much ! many dishes and delicious ! i often eat there and when i leave they always say : see you tomorrow üòÇ"
"tjendrawasih continues to deliver consistent top notch quality for indonesian takeaway (‚Äútoko‚Äù). you can also eat in their shop, they have seating. prices have been the same for many years, 7 euros for a delicious daily menu. many returning customers such as me!"
"tjendrawasih delivers consistent quality for indonesian takeaway meals ... their daily menu with spicy rice is quite gorgeous. the sateh kambing (goat) is to die for. since their sister restaurant rajawali was closed, you can also have a sit-down dinner there."
"the atmosphere is not the best, very simple decoration, nevertheless the food is excellent (take away also possible). there is a good variety of foods meats/fish/vegetarian. the taste is good and i know as i family inlaws are indonesian! i can certainly suggest it."
"the atmosphere of the restaurant could be improved, but the food, taste is beyond excellent! parking is not a problem in the area."
"tjendrawasih is a toko still, but now also has a restaurant section which is opened until 10pm on tue-sunday. food remains great indonesian. service sweet and friendly."
"tjendrawasih has a gorgeous takeaway buffet from which you can make your selections... but to make it easy they also offer a predefined daily menu for about 7 euros. i like to take it with spicy nasi (fried rice) really good. also their peanut sauce is gorgeous, true indonesian, and their sateh kambing is to die for. "
"thendrawasih is a takeaway with small restaurant capability (a toko) with superbly outstanding authentic indonesian food. day menu for 6,50 warmly recommended! fantastic sateh kambing!"
"the best indonesian take away of the randstad. original indonesian recipes from grandma are used that will bring your taste buts to this country. all fresh and original ingredients are used and this causes you to come back and back. just to sit down and eat lunch is great. i love the ajam smoor chicken which has an amazing sauce with unions and cloves that gives me a great smile, with tender chicken and spice rice combined with sajoir lodah vegetabl "
"nice toko next to my home. very delicious dishes, especially chicken cashew. not very expensive.  strongly recommend!"
talamini prepares and serves excellent real italian icecream in quite unusual varieties. outstandingly good! would easily rate it 5 stars if not the staff behind the counter were busily engaged in conversation and could not spare a smile for the customer (although they helped quickly).
excellent ice cream.   a lot of different flavours. very good taste and moderate priced.  very friendly staff.
i have been again there on a hot day in july.  as usually the ice cream has been excellent.   the service also very friendly.
i know this caf√© many years. it is a traditional ice cream shop in old rijswijk.   very good are also the ice cream tarts which are a lovely dessert or a nice present.  very friendly service.
great ice cream. but why oh why is it open for such a short period? wed love to have ice cream also in winter.
they have the best ice cream ive ever had in the netherlands and ive been to quite a lot of ice cream bakeries. the natural taste of each kind of ice cream make them the best.
"talamini, located in the old town center of rijswijk, is definitely your best choice for ice cream in the region. we love going there with our kids during the summer months. its only a short bike ride from our ho "
"all the ice cream variety is juuuust so delicious!  my fave is cherry mania, cappucino and tiramisu.."
"very delicious ice cream. good prices. and they have a good customer friendly programme that if you buy ice cream 10 times for 5 euro, you get half liter of ice cream for free. its pretty cool."
"tandoori lamb - the presentation is like a sizzler, the meat is like a steak, and yet the taste is familiarly indian. that‚Äôs just perfect for non-indians to experience indian cuisin "
"the food was amazing. it is really hard to find good indian food in the netherlands, but this restaurant has some of the best indian food i have ever eaten!"
"a dinner was all that took me here. it is located in reijswijk (pronounced as rys wyk), it takes some amount of walking to reach here. the location is close to the city center. it is also located in an area known for restaurants, so sorrounding is good and gave a semblance of old ci "
"my friend and i walked into this restaurant early in the evening (just before 18:00) on boxing day, looking for a place to ea "
good service and excellent food. a large variety of indian dishes from mild to very spicy. relaxed and cosy atmosphere.
we wanted to go and have dinner in the centre of rijswijk and we decided to try out the clay oven. its located in a very code street with very old buildings. the ambiance inside was great and the hostess were lovel 
we liked the froendlines of the staff and very delicious food. we were surprised as the portions are very big and the prices are reasonable. we will return for sure.
i enjoy eating here everytime im the neighborhood. the quality and service are very good. my favorite thing on the menu is by fat the chicken tiki masala and the almond naan.
"the environment is quite end peaceful, the staff is helpful and nice and the food is really good. they have several vegetarian options. by the way, they have great coffee for the dutch standards since they have a professional expresso machine. the prices seem a bit high though but not so high gor the dutch standards."
"nice indian restaurant in rijswijk. nice and clean, decoration tasteful. menu card relatively limited but variated. had a great curry spicy and with fresh ingredients. prices fair. good value for money."
superfriendly staff and typical indian dishes with emphasis on tandoori dishes. the paneer and chicken tikka tandooris are my favorites. take away also possible.
"this open-kitchen indian restaurant is the lifes work of the owner, mr. sarker. you may find him attending your table, ensuring everything is just right. an extensive menu will satisfy every taste; the tasting menus are nicely varied and excellent value. many vegetarian options. while the building is vintage, the interior is entirely made over in natural tones with india accents. order your preferred heat level, the kitchen will meet your needs. fresh ingredients freshly cooked with attention to detail -- go feast! (btw, catering, carry-out, and banquet facilities are available)"
"visited this resturant after a spending the day at the beach. atmosphere is okay and the resturant itself is located in a peaceful area. we ordered a mix platter option, and were served 3-4 dishes menu for three persons in a mixed serving. (it would be nice if serving is made on individual basis, considering some eat more then others;) owner was nice guy explananing the dishes and suggesting options to order, the other staff was not very engaging, the food served was quite good. especially the chicken curry option was done really well and the soup as a starter is highly recommended to try. chicken tandoori (grilled chicken) could have been done better, overall nice resturant and the menu option to order one and try many is really good especially when you are new to indian cusine, recommended place to eat"
"chosen by my dutch colleague to try indian food, this was actually a good choi "
"the clay oven has great indian food which is delicious whether you want it just tasty spicy or hot spicy!  great service, friendly staff and gorgeous interior."
i recently visited the clay oven as i was missing good indian food while on myntravel to netherlands. found this restaurant as closest to my hotel and decided to try. was pleasantly surprised. food was good and authentic indian taste. good quantity as well. service was excellent. the staff were very keen to make it a good experience. strongly recommend if yiu are in the area.
"when i arrived only one other table was occupied. the service was excellent, the meal was delectable, the spicyness was perfect, the garlic naan was amazing."
the restaurant has been there for about a year. i am not a great fan of indian food but we went there with some family members. what a pleasant surprise it was. the food was tasty and plenty and the atmosphere really nice. good service and definitely worth to come back.
"we stopped by early in the evening and the place was still empty but that soon changed. the service was friendly and the food very flavourfull, we will definitely come here again and the restaurant is nice addition to the herenstraat."
"had dinner here in november 2015; great food, very affordable, accompanied by some great beer! their mango lassi is also a great choice!"
"everything a good indian restaurant should be: fantastic food (their tikka massala is the best i ever tried in holland), friendly but discreet service and ok prices. i was happy to discover that the restaurant does not have this characteristic spice mix smell -well done! i cant wait to go there again!"
"wonderful indian food, sweet, very attentive staff, very relaxed atmosphere in the heart of the old rijswijk."
came across this restaurant actually by accident when looking for a decent dinner with a custom 
"having enjoyed a takeaway from the restaurant just after it first opened, i finally got round to visiting with some friends for a birthday celebration. the staff were very welcoming and helpful and the food was brought to the table quickly. we had a nice mix of starters between the four of us (quite small portions but perfectly adequate given the mains to follow) then lamb/chicken/prawn/vegetarian mains plus a selection of extras and breads. i tasted all of the mains and thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful - some were hotter than others but all were beautifully spiced. we were too full to order desserts however, while waiting for the bill, i was given a birthday surprise sparkling mango ice cream - a lovely end to the meal. the bill including drinks was under 140 eur so very good value for money. id definitely recommend a visit or, at least, try the takeaway."
"the clay oven opened around february in risjkwijk and having heard some good reports, decided to pay them a visit. the place was very inviting, decor good and very fresh, as you would expect from a new restaura "
"an absolute must-see-and-go when youre in rijswijk. delicious breads, cakes, cookies, snacks and sandwiches.and very friendly service!"
still a good location for a coffee or a something to drink.  the pannekoeken with bacon is also very good.  no place to have a dinner but perfect for a short break.
nice location with a covered heated veranda for smokers ( in winter or for bad weather ) and some table outside in summ 
i really like it. during the season they have 12 different flavours of ice-cream in the nice shop. in addition they also sell chocolate bars.
honemade icecream in the beautiful center of maassluis. lots of different delightfull tastes. price is somewhat high but quality excellent
"really great ice cream and very good value for money. we visit quite a lot over the summer months and the flavors are fantastic, plenty of seating inside and o "
"even the italians are jealous on this ice cream. ben & jerrys is trying to unravel the recipys of jeroen. ola tries to buy his ice creams and kalise has tried to copy them. nobody succeed, so try them out on the marketplace in central maassluis. i have been there a lot of times and enjoying every icecream taste."
"jeroen and his wife ,are both master ice makers verry nice shop and ecelent ice cream and many flavours"
a 15-minute stroll on a warm weekend afternoon brings us to this splendid home-made ice-cream shop in the old centre of maassluis. the quality of the ice and the service are superb. go out of your way to drop by - you wont regret it!
they have the best ice cream ever. many different tastes. i am always very tempted to go in and buy an ice cream when i walk past.
"this is one of the best icecreams shops in town and with so many great vari√©t√©s, a must for any ice cream lover!!"
the place to take your refreshment in maassluis. home-made ice cream prepared in the factory behind the shop. perfect location in the middle of the town near the harbour and many shops.
"great ice-cream, home-made in its own small factory behind the shop. lots of different tastes, almost as good as italian."
do not miss this ice cream place. a great assortiment of different ice creams. also diabetic available. very nice staff.
"a tiny italian restaurant and take-away off the beaten-track serving excellent freshly made pizza and pasta dishes. small and plain, its not a place for a intimate evening but it is a bit special. my pizza was wonderfully thin and crispy, but my wifes pasta had very little of the meat it was supposed to have (ossenhaas) and the truffle was non-existent. that said, the home-made tiramisu is to die for - save space for it!"
"when we visited gioja we were blown away by the quality of the food. the taste, everything was as my friends told me. perfect. small point of improvement: the pasta with seafood was very heavy on salt. but h√©, this could happen.."
this is by far the best italian restaurant in the neighberhood; everything is freshly made by italian people for a good price. once you have been here you never want to go anywhere else!
we got loads of indonesian colleagues and they all tasted us their traditional dishes. the food over there tastes much better than it does in the netherlands on average.. however.. haven indah is an exception for sure! lovely food at all times! perfect take away and delivery service too!
"always friendly staff, i have been eating here for 12 year "
"great place. at the entrance one of the people (maybe the owner) said that we will eat the best breakfast in town here. he lied because it was the best breakfast in the whole netherlands. we took the de lux breakfast there. huge selection, everything fresh, delicious. very nice service. bathroom cleaner than many hotels. amazing place."
we visited just for coffees. they were lovely. the food on offer looked good. unfortunately we had to move on for lunch. this place has some indoor seating and a little outside the front. but most is located over the road on a floating canal barge - charming
the village of spijkenisse is attrative to visit. old fishing village with a lot of historical buildings. walking around gives appetize for a good lunch. in the centre we had a good lunch at a boat in the canal. service was very good and the food very good for a reasonable price. good to revisit
"we stopped here to eat on our way to the ferry home and the good reviews we had read did not disappoint. we found it was open on sunday evening (ptobably cos summer hols time) and the staff were friendly and helpful (our dutch is non-existent). nice relaxed atmosphere sitting outside; we just had bread with dips and olives as a starter and if was yummy... main dish of chicken fillet in paprika sauce with peppers, mushrooms onions and trimmings was colourful and really tasty, wiped up every bit from.the plate. would definitely come here again if in the area!"
"we have now enjoyed two meals here in 3 days, the food, the service and ambiance, were all excellent."
monsieur paul is one of my favorite places to go to in maassluis. food is always average in variety but good in quality! especially when the weather is nice it‚Äôs lovely to sit outside on the terrace. it is that we like our own house to chill too. otherwise we would come here more often!
went to this amazing cafe twice last week for both cake and breakfast on our way to and from hook of holland. fantastic food and lovely service will definitely go back next time we visit
always a nice visit. food is always great and there is a little boat you can also sit on in the sun during summ 
excellent location in maassluis. boat deck during good weather. good quality food and drinks and above all nice staff.
we regularly visit to enjoy the moment with a drink and something nice from the menu. i can recomment their burgers ;)
"we arrived in maassluis at 9am on a cold, gloomy sunday morning, feeling not too hopeful wed be able to get a coffee so early. and then we spotted monsieur paul, putting out his tables. he was so friendly and chatty, and made us feel so cheerful. the coffee and food was lovely. the cafe is very picturesque. but the best thing was monsieur paul himself."
"nice atmosphere, great sandwiches for lunch but also try the hapas & tapas for diner. absolute worth a visit"
"a nice place to stop buying fresh bread, having something to drink or having lunch. especially in summer on the boat in front of monsieur paul. inside it could be (too) busy!"
i grew up in maassluis and this place has always been popular with locals. bread etc freshly made and plenty of choice for everyone.
"you can have here a very good lunch. they sell very good petit  pains and club sandwiches, little pizza s. during the lunch you can have several salades like goat salad with honey and bread"
"after some sightseeing in maassluis on a very windy and cool day in may, we found this restaurant to be the perfect spot for a coffee break. it has the most charming of d√©cor, a mix of old and new, with pictures on the walls of not only the town, to show how its grown, but its people as well. it just has a very cozy feeling to it which i absolutely adored. we chose to sit at the back patio, which is more or less a sunroom, a delightful surprise for although it was windy and cold the sun was shinning and this was the perfect way to enjoy it. i ordered a caramel koffie which came accompanied by a chocolate truffle covered in cocoa powder. both coffee and truffle were absolutely divine! delicious beyond words! i cant wait for our next visit to maassluis, for if the coffee tastes that good than the food must be mind blowing!"
it was pretty cold and windy in may so we sit inside near the lovely balcony at the back of the restaurant. it was a nice balcony with 4 tables that sit 16 people. the food we ordered was great and fresh. the price was reasonable. if the weather was nice sitting outside or on the boat would be lovely so we could enjoy the atmosphere of this old town.
"had a family dinner here. chose for the three course menu and i must say, the bavette was surprisingly good! restaurant was running at a limited capacity due to covid19. staff was very friendly."
"my favorite restaurant. delicious food, nice staff, lots of special menus. cosy restaurant nearby parking place"
"i visited kevin‚Äôs while working here in massluiss. the service was great, they had menus in english which was of great help to me being scottish.   the food was outstanding, it was a busy place and i can see why it‚Äôs very popular.   highly recommended."
we had a nice 3 course meal. we said goodbye to one of our excellent interns. we had good food we good portions.
"been there with our family (3 kids). friendly people and good food for normal price. normally the kids does not eat much, but there was enogh choice on the menu."
i enjoyed my dinner here though i think there could be a wee bit more choice but was told the menu changed every now and then. friendly service and nice ambiance.
quick and decent service. uitsmijter was ok. nice menu for lunch. price is also affordable. crowded for a lunch this does suggest that it is a popular place.
drove round and round this little place looking for a bar or restaurant on the way to the port. eventually found the town square where there was a great variety of places. the eetcafe was a good choice. the staff were welcoming and efficient. the menu offering lots of options as well as a specials. the service was also quic 
good place to eat. meals are not spectacular but ok. they serve a lot of different beers.  easy to stay after dinner for a good time and some beers.
"always great food and beers! the staff is very kind and always smiling. always good the be there!  love the beers aswell, great variaty."
"friends of mine invited me for lunch in de buren and they could not have invited me for a better place. the baquette de buren was excellent, fresh and food was served fast by waitress marion who despite being busy combined this with a friendliness that makes one feel welcomed here."
"i believe this restaurant is part of a chain of restaurants, however, i never visited one before. i was there for lunch with a group of three other people and we all ordered something different. it was quite difficult to make a choice as they have quite an extensive lunch menu. however, all of us eventually made a choice. we had to wait quite some time for it to arrive, but that didnt matter as we were in no rush. it was definitely worth the wait when it arrived! all four of us were very happy with our choices. it was all freshly made and very good value for money."
"very nice returent,  the prices are great, and the service is wonderful. comfy and charming place, good for families"
"great place, renende a year ago, but same hospitality, same kindness, same people, but a quit different approach on the menu. very nice choices and still wonderful food."
excellent food and fast service. you can order the food and take it to home to use the dinner in your family setting.
"on the way home after visiting the zoo, we stopped at yangs garden. we ordered some vegetarian to take away. the service was good, the price was reasonable, big portion and unexpectedly very tasty."
"a very nice and cosy restaurant where it is better to book a table. all dishes, fish or meat, are really fresh (from water nearby or from the field also nearby). our steaks were excellent, tender. desserts also good. and staff was really nice, welcoming and providing advice on nice things to do in the area!"
"if you plan to eat here, make a reservation. this a cozy place with only a few tables. there is also an outdoor terrace at the water side, a very nice stay when the weather permits. outstanding food quality , made from locally farrmed ingredients. pricing is at the low range, and are certainly a bargain considered the quality. very friendly staff. nice beers, wines and drinks on the me "
"having had one evening meal and several beers from their huge list of craft beers, i returned twice for more, as the food was excellent, the setting beautiful, and the staff very welconing. my favourite was the fish soup-- a dish i had twice, it was so good. i tried another nearby restaurant, but it was not as good, in my opinion, so i went back the next night to the bolwerk!"
"driving between giethoorn and amsterdam, we stopped in sloten hoping for some lunch to match the old dutch ambience of the village. too cold for the canal side seating, we went inside the tavern where it was warm and cozy "
after walking through the city of sloten we saw the restaurant bolwerk! they have seating outside on the canal and it looks very inviting to sit down and have some lunch. we sat down and had lunch and we were very happy with everything. the meals were excellent and the waitresses very friendly. the prices are very reasonable. we had a very pleasant afternoon at the bolwerk. if we lived closer we would definitely come back for more.
"one of the best pizzas in the utrecht area. very good wood-fired pizza. friendly staff. cozy place to eat, although i normally take out."
"honestly, the oven pizza here is awesome!  i felt as if i were eating back in italy. i never expected to find such authentic, cozy italian place in utrecht area. they focus on quality rather than quantity."
"again we ordered some pizzas here. pasta is not an option yet, its all about pizza and anti past "
pizza and pasta a la mama! very good food served by friendly staff. all the right flavors are there. ingredients were very fresh and tasty and that my friends is the most i lik 
"very small restaurant that also makes pizzas for take away. the pizzas are light and thin with a loverly crispy dough. they are absolutely delicious and you can see that the owners truly care about their food. unfortunately , the pizza are so light that they are also not terribly filling. my kids managed to finish their grown up pizzas without batting an eye, which meant that as an adult with an average to larger apetite you leave feeling like you could probably have eaten at least another half pizza. but at 12 euros for a pizza, you dont."
delicious treats await while an awesome playground next to the restaurant will keep your kids busy. kids said the hot chocolate
"set in the park over looking the water. a good venue to lunch with friends. sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. our waiter was friendly and efficient, quickly providing menus and taking drink orders. we did notice that the restaurant was very busy but short staffed. our salads were large, fresh and enjoyable. we then indulged in their carrot cake, which is excellent. "
nice meals and drinks in a very nice place. the food is served by very nice waiters and the can also give you a good advice.
we recently went on the boxing day. it was difficult to get a table in the beginnig as the place was completely booked. the staff was dressed in traditional attire and were warm & friend 
"what else can i say? my wife is a vegan and got a specially prepared vegan meal! friendly staff and a varied menu in a home style atmosphere. they even have cultural nights here now and then. location is great, in the middle of a beautiful park. recommended!!"
"the location is really pretty and honestly that is the real sell of the restaurant. it is located in the middle of a large park and if the weather is nice, it is a gorgeous location. just be ware that their is a huge playground literally next to the restaurant so there will be a lot of little kids running arou "
"what a nice place. the restaurant is situated in a park next to a play ground and a observation tower. the pavilion is very light and fresh, though cosy. drinks and snacks were all very good"
nice modern cafe-style eatery with lovely sandwiches and cakes. right next to big park playground. for people that want a bit quiet and some wine there is a separate area.
"the food is delicious and healthy. i think they use organic products, mostly. and its not too expensive. there is a nice playground for kids. i think its a nice place for all ages. you can have a nice walk (with your dog) in the park. the environment is beautiful. most times i visited anafora there were a lot of families with children - what entails a certain amount of activity and noise. for me not the place to be, just to relax."
on a sunny saturday we enjoyed a delicious lunch in this restaurant. the staff is very friendly. the place is excellently located in a park near to a large playground  children of every age will enjoy.
"the location, in the middle of the park, is amazing. it is so relaxing, in the middle of nature. it creates a real holiday or sunday afternoon feeling. great for kids too. staff/service is professional. good snacks, but not exceptional."
"this restaurant, located in the middle of the maxima park in utrecht is great during a sunny day! theres a huge playground for kids nextdoor and there are plenty of lounging opportunitie "
"very beautiful place in the middle of a park , fantastic decor ,  good location good food and friendli staff !highly reccomend !!!! a++++"
very enjoyable dinner for the four of us at a waterside table. clearly this is a very popular spot for locals to meet and greet. our dinners were very good and the service was quick and efficient. we had called earlier to make a reservation and our request was honored. very accommodating staff and a beautiful location. parking is available across the street.
"de punt is a friendly and authentic brasserie where you can enjoy some simple food. the place has a really nice and old fashioned vibe and it seems like a place where local people have a drink and chat with their friends. the food is nothing fancy, but since it is very cheap, you get great value for money. we had the burger, a salad with goat cheese and the children went for fries and pizza. we had a pleasant time!"
de punt is located at the river angstel and has a nice outdoor terrace at the watersi 
during my stay in the netherlands i visited this place twi 
"we stumbled on this place, what a find.   staff were really friendly, nice atmosphere, only had lunch but pizza was lovely, went back again next day.   if visiting amsterdam well worth a look."
"it was a walking distance from the hotel i stayed. good food, generous portions, good service. enjoyed."
"the buffet was very good! delicious chinese dishes, friendly staff. the place was comfy and very clean. buffet price was very convenient."
one can enjoy their meals everyday without being fed up. the food is very fresh and tasty. you feel like going on and on and on. but there is a time to stop! you cant stop the taste bud s though. great meal experience.
"we have never had so much choice in dutch pancakes. sweet, savory, cheese and special dutch pancakes. they are about 12 inch in diameter, thinner than breakfast pancakes and thicker than crepes. you will be loving them. if you cannot choose; try the sweet and savory 50/50 combo."
"this pancake restaurant is located neer de maarsseveense plassen, a well know recreation area. they have a wide variety of pancakes form sweet to hearty. we both had pancake bolognese. delcious and well filled. service is friendly and quick enough. prices are a bit high but it is worth while there are many children vut the place is very cosy."
staf is really friendly and the food is lovely. just a classic dutch pancake house with s big variatie of pancakes
"its unbelievable how many different crepes they prepare here. name it, they have i "
this is a very good pancake house situated near de maarsseveense plassen. nice view over the water. pancakes are of good quality and warm. place is a bit noisy because of the many children who luke a pancake. one half our is enough. o yes and a huge free parking space.
"we went here on a sunny saturday afternoon in august. the place was really busy. however, there is plenty to do for the kiddies, making the atmosphere more relaxed. unfortunately, we were plagued by wasps."
"a more modern style pancake restaurant at the maarsseveense plassen. very busy, lots of kids, lots of pancakes to choose from. nice play area for kids as well. if youre with children this is a perfect place for a quick pancake dinner."
"my boyfriend and i visited tonight, not expecting much but wanting something fast and easy as we had been travelling all day and didnt feel that great. however, we were really, really pleasantly surprised. the service was friendly and attentive without being overbe.overbearing. the location was easy to find and had parking easily available on nearby street "
"due to a visit from a dutch friend from the states, we went to tante liens for take away indonesian food (rice table). they also have about 10 tables of which 6 were already reserved. the restaurant, take away opens from 16:00 onwards and we think is the best place together with toko mitra at lange viestraat 2 in utrecht to order your rice table (3-4 options or order separate dishes. be aware that indonesian food can be spicy (pedis) and consult the staff before ordering. their sate gambing (lam) and ayam blado (balinese chicken) are heaven. enjoy!"
"this little gem in the center of maarssen is a lovely restaurant. it is not up-scale or posh; there is a counter for take-away orders, and there are only around 10 tables to sit at. the service is friendly, but the main reason to visit this place is the food. authentic indonesian food. i highly recommend one of the rijsttafels, a meal that consists of several small dishes all served at once for sharing with the table. there is something for everyone, from spicy chicken to tofu and beans with coconu "
"very nice, friendly and good quality indonesian food - for sit down dinner or take-away. excellent flavors and choice of dishes for a very reasonable price."
the restaurant lay out is functional and simple.the food can also be ordered as takeaway (great if you have an holiday apartment or if you eat at hom 
"whenever you are in the vicinity of utrecht, maarssen to be excact, and you have a craving for some great ol indo food, i can absolutely recommend tante liens. its a cozy and small restaurant where you can either sit or takeaway. in both cases you will not be dissapointed. the food is traditional and divers, with all the classics off course. all there is left to say from me to you is selamat makan!"
"went here a couple of times. i usually go here for takeaway food but it is also a cosy place for in dining. friendly staff, good food and plenty to choose from the menu. would recommend!"
"in a country where you can find many indonesian restaurants of generally good quality; tante liens positively stands out. the setting and atmosphere are between casual and oriental (they do takeaway food as well). their rice table is just sublime. despite their very reasonable prices and low profile, the many different tastes guarantee a culinary journey. just superb. will come back. "
"such pleasure to eat here! the food is great and so is the service. we both enjoyed the indonesian menu for 2. nice and cosy restaurant in a small village, not far from utrecht."
they did improve the dishes which were goo salty for my taste so it is excellent now. cosy dining in a family oriented place. take a way possibilities
a very nice little restaurrant in the centre of historic maarssen. very nice indonesiamn decration. very friendly young staff. foof is of very good quality. you can eat frm cheap to mid ranged prices.
nice and original food served to go or in a restaurant. locals and foreigners claim it to be the most original in the utrecht area.
"this is an interesting case where taste of food is more important than looks. when you enter this is a kind of take away, but it has a sitting down part as well and the food is simple but nicely cooked. english speaking is limited in this village restaurant, so there is a lot of fingerpointing and guessing to do. a very interesting experience!"
"lots of choices, big portions, kids friendly, fast service, what else you need? and if you want to have slightly fancy dinner you can do it in the restaurant next door"
"if we go for pancakes, we typically go to de gloeiende gerrit. the size of the pancakes and toppings are very good. the specials are interesting, tasty and value for money. you can also build your own pancake. if you want to go for pancakes with a group or just together for a quick diner, this restaurant is a good choice. the kids love the special playground as well."
"really great pancakes, lovely staff. you can create your own pancake or choose one from the menu. you can also choose one of two batters. with of without children, this place serves pancakes for all"
great pancakes and good staff. the sphere is authentic and great for children. they have a separate place in the attic for the children to play. thanks pancakes are delicious and they use good quality ingredients
great restaurant for pancakes in all sizes and flavors. further friendly staff and a good atmosphere.
"we have a pancake lunch with 16 persons (incl 8 kids 1-11 years old). great tablespot, good pancakes with enough topping, great play addic for kids (from 2 yeas and older). great service! location is in a urban living area, bud nice and green surroundigs."
"lovely restaurant with nice terrass in spring/summer. great food, nice staff and atmosphere. we really like bij bart"
"a spacious, high ceiling restaurant (nicely decorated) with a limited menu. but we enjoyed the dishes we had. taco‚Äôs with vegetarian gamba‚Äôs and a good burger. as a starter a plate with several small starters. very friendly waiters, it took a bit to long before dishes arrived. but we will go there again!"
"lucky with some a nice september sun, having a drink and some snacks on their outside terrace. the bourgondische bitterballen are quite nice, lots of proper meat inside, very tasty. service is good and friendly. enjoyable visit."
"nice terras, good service, small menu but verry good food! price/quality is also good. also the inside of de restaurant is modern end cosy."
"limited menu, however a very good quality and a very good service. menu is limited, but adjusted regulary enough to keep a returning guest very interested."
good choice of pancakes reasonable price myself i would prefer a thinner pancake then the second pancake would be completly eten.
"popped in whilst cycling through netherland, only had a coffee and chocolate brownie, but it was fab, the brownie was delicious!! friendly staff even topped my water bottle up with ice!! (it was redders!)"
"had dinner here with my fianc√©e last night. fantastic food, great service, really friendly staff. best. steak. ever. üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä"
"there where two dishwashers in the restaurant. i saw them cleaning the forks, knifes and spoons. when i was eating it was very clean so i was very pleased with that. so i think they should get a promotion. it was on friday btw. besides the dishwashers, the food was very good aswell. "
"super service , one of the best burgers i ever had and very relaxing environment. i was never in spankenburg."
"we visited this with dutch friends for lunch...3 of us had the fish platter , a trio of fish and i had the spanish burger....the food was very good and we had no complaints ..the service was good too and the staff were welcoming. it wasnt cheap though."
"stopped by for dinner a d loved the food and service, don.t miss this food if you are in the area. the ice cream with berries and mint leaves with a chocolate are not to be missed."
"visited here for a family lunch today, 6 adults and 5 children! the food was superb, the service fantastic and in a lovely relaxed setting. cannot fault this restaurant and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to others."
"this is the 2nd time ive visited here. what an absolute treat. we went without booking on friday afternoon and it was almost empty. this restaurant should be packed full, its top not "
"call it a tourist in your own country. i had never been to spakenburg until i received an invitation from a good friend for lunch. spakenburg has traditionally been a fishing village located on the zuiderzee until the construction of the afsluitdijk. since then, the fishing fleet has shrunk, but fish processing and trade still play an essential role in the local economy. the restaurant is located in the center of the village, and parking is free of charge on the schansplein behind the restaurant. upon entering, we received a very friendly welcome and decided to take a table at the front near the window. we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and creativity of the dishes. if you are visiting this beautiful authentic village, this is definitely recommended."
prima restaurant. schone tpoiletten. tafels met linnenvoor de lunch. vriendelijk personeel. food was excellent. clean restrooms. kind personnel. clean teras. nice menu card. good selection of wines. lunch was served by personnel who had gloves on. very hiegenic.
we were lucky enough to get a table and ate outside with the wonderful backdrop of this beautiful fishing village. (booking is advised as it is busy and popul 
"you will find this cozy restaurant smack in the center of the picturesque fisher town of spakenburg. fresher fish still swim. excellent wine selection. perfect for families, couples and for business lunch/dinner too."
"we were staying at centerparcs and took the ferry to spakenburg. had (tripadvisor) researched in advance where we wanted to have lunch , so knew where we were aiming for ! and we were definitely not disappointed. we focused on fish dishes and, despite being fish lovers and having eaten fish in may countries, these flavours were a new experience. the lady chef certainly knows how to create a fiesta on a plate and how to get all the elements dancing together in perfect sink. it wasnt cheap, but it was definitely worth the money. fabulous quality, seasonal ingredients, great combinations. we really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend."
"the food was amazing. i was taken there for a business dinner close to the office. this was a big surprise. half the table had seafood dishes - including me and it was amazing. the capriccio, veal and steak dishes looked great and the others really liked it. the restaurant was cozy and elegant. the service was friendly and good. this is in a small former fishing village with still many antique dutch boats. the cheese plate for desert was very good. i had a very nice organic local pilsner and food good grenache/syrah by the glass wine. even the bread was a very tasty sourdough. it is a truly great place. you need a car to go there. it is worth the trip."
"i visited here on the last day of my first visit to holland with my husband and his oma, it was the perfect way to end the trip!! the food was incredible, i had the shrimp croquettes which are amazing. the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the decor was lovely. i honestly cannot say good enough things about this place. cant wait to go back! "
very good restaurant that offers you a very good dinner and some good wines too. by far the best restaurant spakenburg has to offer
"a really recommendated restaurant with a fine qualification in the gault millau. especially the fish is good. also the location of the restaurant is perfect, espacially on the terrace."
this was a great experience of dutch culture in a quaint fishing village with an ancient history. the old sailing ships outside only add to the ambiance. the restaurant itself appears to be freshly remodeled. wait staff were very friendly and service oriented. this type of dinning is meant to enjoy your company and without being rushed. the food was great and presentation was also a wonderful part of the meal. make time to tour the town but get there early because the sidewalks roll up early. we are going back for sure.
"enjoyed a nice lunch in the sun. the restaurant is located at the little harbour of spakenburg, a small village. when cycling, most routes go through here, so you will do well to plan your stop he "
"went here unannounced on a saturday night on what seems to be spakenburgs favourite nighttime district. got a wall table at the back. excellent fish soup and bouillabaise. the sea bass was a bit spongy. the accompanying vegetables, such as jerusalem artichoke and other non-mainstream greens, were undercooked. service was ok."
"we have eaten here many times and sometimes you would expect in other restaurants a bad day or lesser quality. however not in this restaurant!! the quality is always at a very high standard and difficult to beat, even for star restaurants. it is a cozy and not too large restaurant, with lots of space between tables. the fish is the best of the best and cannot be any fresher. ( and i ate a lot around the world ) the staff is also very nice and polite and always with a smile. winelist is pretty large with some nice surprises on  "
ooh i love this place. the service is great. the waitress heard i was english and immediately conversed in english. i had the carpaccio again as i hadnt stopped dreaming about the first time i ate it there 2 years ago. it wasnt exactly the same but delicious nonetheless. the rest of the family were pleased with their orders. ill be back again next may!
"the better restaurant in spakenburg. perfect for business meetings, lunches and intimate dinners. good food, not to expense (upper side), friendly service (but amateuristic at times), nice location in the center, but good parking available in the are "
"overlooking the market, and the harbour from the terrace outside, a nice upscale restaurant in spakenbu "
"ive been here two years ago, but this time i can say that the food was fantastic. the atmosphere is nice and the people are kind. i loved the deer meat and the jumbo."
"the entree of the restaurant is promising. modern furniture in an old building can be a challenge but here it works. the lunch menu shows a variety of cold and warm fish plates. all of them look great and the prices are acceptabel. the staff is friendly though not very professional as the empty large teacups were left on the table during the lunch, leaving not much space for the large dishes."
"not very cheap, but the food is worth every euro ! nice attentive waitresses."
good service with great staff. the food is great and the location at the waterside is really lovely.
"what a little gem there is here. we discovered it by chance and so glad we stopped. we spent a wonderful few hours on the side of the canal, enjoying a meal and music with the locals. find it if you can, just make sure you allow quite a few hours to sit and enjoy it."
"i am coming to woudsend and heeg since 1964. de watersport ist an unique restaurant, which i have visiten minimum 30 times. eating.    there was always perfect! pure last visite was on 06/25/2018 : great !!!"
"perfect location next to the bridge and facing the canal (and sheltered from the n & w winds), so great for people watching and boat watching. we enjoyed a lovely impromptu sunday lunch of open sandwiches - i had the goats cheese, rocket and walnut with honey, and elaine the pulled pork with salad. both were flavoursome and ample, and the brown bread was very fresh and light - and all accompanied by a good beer and a lovely chilean sauvignon blanc, and friendly and helpful service. really hit the spot!"
we were out and about on our bikes and decided to stop here for lunch on a sunday as it was by the canal and in the sun. the service was good as was the food. great spot even if you only have time for a coffee.
my family live in woudsend and when i visit this is the first place i like to  
windmills are amazing and having a koffie & broodje kroket in a windmill is pretty awesome.  the windmill is old and bears my surname...i claim it as my own üòâ friendly staff... it is a must if you like windmills.
"this restaurant is located in an authentic mill, were they actually grind the grain and bake pancakes with it. their applepie has been chosen as best in the region."
"at this ijssalon (icecreamparlor) you can choose from a great variety of home made icecream, really delicious! also a good choice for your coffee or tea, with a mini-icecream on the side!"
"for my birthday we had a lunchbuffet, it was really great! two soups, salads, sandwiches and roles, fruit etc. everything fresh and tasting great. i got a lot of compliments from my guests!"
my son and i had just completed a 20 mile bike ride and were looking for some refreshment and a cool place to s 
"nice little restaurant in the centre of vaassen. no haute cuisine, but good simple food (its schnitzel-paradise). pleasant staff. good value for money. would go there again."
ignore the older review saying the coffee was bad here. it definitely isnt and was one of the best on our holid 
"great atmostphere,  excellent food, friendly service and very good value for money.  had one of the best spare ribs i have ever had,  and the cordon-bleu was outstanding.  highly recommended... worth a trip off the highway to find this gem."
"me and my mrs went here after work and after the very friendly staff had seated us, we enjoyed picking the meals that we wanted from a very promising menu. when the starters came i was excited and then i had the best pull pork wraps of my life, super lekker, all the dishes were amazingly tasty but to be honest i can‚Äôt remember anything other than the pork wraps! "
"simply fantastic. the place is actually in a green zone, full of trees and nature. the wooden decoration is quite original. also the food is fresh and quite good. you have free parking and also outdoors tables to enjoy your meal. 100 % appealing."
"the waitstaff makes this place 5 star. welcoming, gracious, friendly.  they really do a great job.  menu is small, well constructed meals.  interior is found items country chic.  outdoor terrace in front, enclosed terrace at the rear.  adequate parking.  both lunch and dinner service."
"beautiful and interesting establishment, very friendly and helpful service, the food (we tried only the soups) is ok."
i had been there several times and i always received the best. the food was really delicious and the service was great. do not hesitate to go there if you want to enjoy a really nice time.
"we came to town for a conference, ate here on the first night and came back for the remaining three nigh "
delicious cosy and fairly priced country style restaurant. service is amazing. added to my favorites.
"we were looking for a place for lunch on our way home from a short vacation in the netherlands. selecting an unknown restaurant is a bit bleak business in the netherlands, because mostly you will find far too busy outdoor seating, indifferent staff, waiting times of biblical proportions, mediocre food, and eye-watering bills. therefore, restaurant de tolboom was a pleasant surprise. restaurant de tolboom is situated in a historic renovated farm house. ample parking is available next to the building. the outdoor tables under the parasols are beckoning. the restaurants has a surprisingly larger selection than pancakes. salads, sandwiches and hot dishes are on the menu, but also pancakes of course. and draft birra moretti is available. attentive and hospitable waitresses were in function on the day we visited. the food was tasty and the bill was not cheap, but for dutch restaurants reasonable. restaurant de tolboom was a big hit and i have added the restaurant to my short list of worthy dutch restaurants. a well deserved five point rating."
"we were merely passing through the region whilst avoiding heavy traffic due to a severe accident on the highway. being just past noon and feeling a little hungry, we decided to stop at this renovated farm. my god! this place is awesome! they have a very cozy and quiet terrace in the back, and with temperatures of about 25 degrees we chose of course to sit outsid "
"our family‚Äôs favorite pancake house . they serve real authentic dutch pancakes . the pancakes are big and really filling. you can choose savory or sweet pancakes. i loved the speciale boer pacake( farmers pancake ) which has bacon, cheese & mushroom."
nice place for family with children. theres a big playground and we sat at a separate table in the woods. with a roof. see picture. not expensive and friendly staff.
"we love pancakes ... thats a fact! and these pancakes have been delicious but on a very different type compared to the pancakes served in the upstairs in amsterdam. these are the type of pancakes you love after a long day working / hiking / exploring. thick, very tasty and definetly short of calories. we had three (bacon & cheese, ham, cheese and pineapple, apple and bacon) and all five of us were very full afterwards! something was even left for the next da "
"we had breakfast with a group of 10 at lounge3, the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was amazing and great value for money. highly recommend going for breakfast here and will be back one day for lunch or dinner!"
"my boyfriend and i went to lounge3 for dinner. the restaurant was busy, but the service was quick and the waiter very friendly. we decided on the dish of the day - an entrecote with salad, fries and a garlic sauce and everything was perfectly cooked and tasted excellent! i highly recommend this place!"
"cosy place, right in the centre of little village voorthuizen. modern, lounge stylish decoratief, with a veranda for those who want to have a smoke. quality food, not particular fancy, but fair and good value for money. extensive beer list with local and foreign beers. try their kaasplankje or wineplankj "
history is very interesting. you can walk around yorself or join the group with tourguide. the tourguide is very pasionate to tell stories. nice combi with visit to muiderslot.
when we were there it was busy (round the island swimming event) so the service was challenged however it was a nice day and we were not in a hurry. we sat outside and chatted with other visitors so time past quickly. our lunch was very tasty and healthy and the fresh mint tea was a joy. it would be easy to critique the place but i suspect the team behind the scenes are volunteers or supporters of this netherlands historic site. we enjoyed our experience and have been in far worse type places and paid a lot more!
"last summer, a few dinners were organised again at the old defence fort island pampushout. it is tiny and located in between muiden & almere. a boat from the organisation will take you there, you get on at ijburg, near amsterdam, but only if you have made a reservation in advance. one advice, dutch summers are nice but the weather can change rapidly or it can be very cool on the water, so best advice would be, to bring something to keep you warm. when we arrived on the island, we got a little tour and a guide told us a bit about the history of the island, which is quite interesting, there is definitely more to it, than meets the eye. then after you have been given some time, to walk around and explore the island, you can make your way to the restaurant. there are different places where you can sit, inside or outside. the evening works in a self-service kind of way and you get your drinks and food with a number that is given to you in the beginning of the evening. you can take as much as a like / crave for- it is all included in the price, apart from the drinks of course. food is simple, but very nice and varies from meat, fish to vegetarian options. at the end, they open a dessert buffet and you can get whatever you like plus a nice cup of coffee before you make your way to the boat again. the sunset is beautiful out here and you feel one with nature in a way. all and all, this was a very nice evening that we all enjoyed very much. it is a night out, but very different from your ordinary dinner at a restaurant. it is a mini adventure but in a comfortable way. sadly and understandably, these dinners are only organised in the summer and like i said, you will need to reserve in advance. it is good for couples to have a romantic dinner but also with friends, family or with your kids."
have had a great diner for a small price. lovely terras in the garden. great servants. fine food to. nice and cosy old- fashioned restaurant to have diner in a relaxed environment.
"i enjoyed a delicious family dinner in the main dining room. the restaurant is cozy, and the flower arrangements were amazin "
"looks, feels and most likely is a family restaurant for the locals. menu only in dutch, but the server explained everything in english :) would recommend over the tourist traps in center of muider"
"this is a great restaurant in a nice village in netherlands. the service, the food, and atmosphere were excellent. the mushroom soup was top-notch as was the white chocolate dessert. the red wine by the glass was fairly priced and quite good. i was really excited they offered fondue as a main dish since i am vegetarian. although it had way too much white wine in it, it was a nice attempt. i would definitely return again as the food overall was very good value and of very good quality. the service was definitely of a high standard as well."
"we found this restaurant during a weekend visit to muiden and ended up going back on the second evening. the fillet steak was fabulous, perfectly cooked and very reasonably priced at 12 euros. the manager made a very good attempt at translating the menu for us and made us feel very welcome. the only downside was the portion of chips was a little on the small side if you only have one course - ok if you have 3 courses though. there was also wild boar, shnitzel and fish on the menu."
i love this bar/restaurant!  its a great place to have a drink and the food is pretty good too.  i had the cheeseburger and it was fantastic.
"lovely spot open all day with great food, drink and atmosphere! the wings brought me back home and the salads are huuuge"
"my son lives in diemen and he took me there for a couple of beers on our way home. i was pleasantly surprised as this is a really good pub, great beers, nice food, the lo "
great people. great drinks. food is nice. very cozy and relaxing. stop by if you are around. less stress and dirt around here :)
"we had twice dinner in this restaurant/bar. service is friendly. the menu card is small but has something for everybody, so it does not need to be larger. we really enjoyed it and the prices are reasonable"
"very nice place, friendly staff , very tasty food and cozy home atmosphere . house specials are delicious! try autumn salad if you want to taste real dutch cuisine ! good for all ages!"
"the staff is really friendly and attentive; they even tried to speak my language ( which they succeeded... though i couldnt speak dutch) good place to meet friends, or just to have a few beers."
"this bar is fantastic. the staff are super friendly and helpful. their food is superb and its very affordable. the decor is absolutely beautiful. i love that you can eat, drink and play darts all at the same time. i would highly recommend cheers for people of any age."
"good quality food, but the owned fakes to be an italian .... h√® is not. using honest products and h√® had good teachers"
the restaurant is very nicely decorated and offers a good selection of light meals and beverages. service varies from from friendly to indifferent. meals are good and the atmosphere is relaxed and romantic.
"on sunday, december 16th, we took a nice walk with our friends in the beautiful nature of lopik and schoonhoven. our goal was to drink hot gluehwein at the little restaurant fausto at the end of the lekdijk in schoonhoven. when we arrived at 16.56 h at fausto‚Äôs it was almost closing time and the owners were cleaning up the machines and the restaurant. nut they opened up again and made us lovely hot gluehwein with orange parts. really goo "

"very nice place, friendly and super good cappuccino :).  great place to have a break, also with kids. they speak dutch, german, english and a bit french :)."
you do not have to go to italy for an excellent cappuccino. great resting point for bikers. all pastry super fresh and delicious! ...
"the food was delicious. theres a relaxed atmosphere. and the waiter is very good at making us feel comfortable. he was there when we needed something without being present all the time. when he noticed we left, he even held the door open for us."
this is probably one of the best restaurants ive ever been to. the food simple but elegant and tasteful. the dining area bold but not overbearing. the service personal and friendly but not unprofessional. a very good experience. i would gladly return for another meal. good job üëç
"keep up the great work! we are coming tomorrow to order the rest of the menu ... and beers !  what can i say ? if 10 is excellent , you deserve 20 !"
this is a very cosy place to enjoy good food at reasonable prices and accompanying wines of very good quality
the restaurant is in down town schoonhoven and it has excellent food. it has a very modern design. the only downside is that you dont have private space: everyone can hear what you are saying.
"good food, good atmosphere and good service!   we had todays special which was mussles. dessert was delicious: creme broulee with nougat ice cream and strawberries with parfait.  we were a family with two teenage girls, 15 and 17 which also enjoyed the place."
this small restaurant in the centre of schoonhoven ensures an  above average quality of food and drinks at a fair price.
"we had a joyful evening with friends and marvelous dinner at eethuys de waag. the presentation of the food was wonderful and the quality of high standard. also the the atmosphere exudes a rustic atmosphere. in short, an ideal place for an joyful evening."
"this was the first place we saw when we arrived in schoonhoven and walked into the village. we loved the way it looked and so, we decided it was worth a look. it is very cosy, now it is also decorated for christmas, making it even more gezellig "
we went there yesterday evening to have dinner following the suggestion of the owner of the b&b where we spent one night. nice place with very friendly people. good food !  to taste with a++++ thank you
"it is the 2nd i eat in this restaurant and excellent: taste, quantity and visual. i recommend. the price is reasonable."
"this is one of the best places to enjoy a typical dutch pancake or pannenkoek. they are so delicious! of course, you could also try the croquettes. another dutch speciality."
"nothing better than lunch on this terrace. perfectly balanced menu, cocktails and service. i go out of my way to visit if im within an hour of sluis. always deliver a 5* experience."
top notch chef with a partner who delivers a michelin experience in the dining room. it has become our favorite restaurant in sluis and we travel from brugge to eat when we can. lovely presentations and creative dishes. superb!
"a beautifully decorated restaurant with a very capable staff. the food was just off.  with or without the star, the quality is of a high standard restaurant."
"very good restaurant and according to the quality reasonable prices (christmas menu, wines included 98‚Ç¨) friendly service, delicious food and beautiful facility (an old bank), right in the center of sluis"
this was a first visit on a warm summer night and we sat on the terrace. the lovely atmosphere was only spoiled by the terrace being covered by quite ugly umbrellas that really did not fit the rest of the deco 
"my suggestion to drink a martini was turned into a special wiskey sour. my wife got cosmopolitan (with cotton candy), a great suggestion but i saw that everyone on the terrace was drinking the same cocktails ... the promised surprise effect was unfortunately le "
"this is a michelin starred restaurants, so it comes with a price tag and with expectations... we were delighted to see there was a special offer which seemed a bit more affordable. unfortunately, im a bit upset with 2 mistakes invoking extra costs in their favor, making it next to impossible to leave with a bill of less than 90 euro a person: (1) the waiter trying to sell a sherry cream as being a petro ximines (and insisting his view was correct) / (2) when ordering the jubileum special menu, not being well explained what them main dish was like, and then - when having doubts about the disk - been given the impression that they would swap the disk ... except they forgot to mention there was an additional price-tag... also the typical amuse gueules you tend to get in these restaurants were missing and the extras that came with the coffee were not impressiv "
"visited by chance on a very hot day. √† la carte starter and main course - a true delight! the crab as a starter, well balanced contrast of asian flavours and as a main course lamb chops that were tender as butter and had a sohisticated smokey flavour. friendly staff and the limoncello cakes with the espresso are something to die for. a very warm thank you from us. and your gins are excellent, too."
"how smart to be open on monday when all restaurants in the region are closed! we ate here on monday, the monday night special (3 courses "
this restaurant has a very stylishly decorated interior with a separate lounge area for aperitifs. there is also outside space in a garden at the re 
amazing evening with colleagues! the food was fabulous and the wine was extraordinary! thanks for the great service as well!
we had a wonderfull evening with friends in a beautiful place. the staff was very kind and attentioned. the food was very good and the service of it excellent. some if us had a 3-dishes menue and the others had a 5-dishes menue. but everything was served right in time. by the way: thanks for the visit of the cellar üòâ
"second time in la trinit√©, but first time at their new location by the wate "
this is a must visit restaurant if your looking for the very best fine dining in a fantastic building with exceptional staff 
"since la trinit√©, in sluis, the netherlands, moved to their new building, along the waterfront in sluis, we paid several visits to this wonderful. restaurant.. the food is fantastic,everytime you can taste another menu of very high quality.the prices are acceptable for a michelin-starrestaurant. the r estaurant itself, is brandnew, very nice,, modern and open.there is a small, but beautiful garden outside, where customers can enjoy their aperitive. but what we can enjoy the most, is the open mind and the friendly way of handling from the lady of the house and the whole staff."
second time here and it wont be the last. we were once again very pleased with all dishes served. the appetizers gave the tone and all mains and deserts were flawless. wine list could present more international wines (non french). the prizes are correct! well be back
if you have the opportunity please take an apero in the lounge! always fresh food and excellent service!
"my wife took me there for my birthday yesterday and i loved it. the interior is smart but comfortable, the staff go out of their way to be helpful and the food is exactly what one expects from a michelin 1 star restaurant. we took the ten sations  menu - ten small different and creative dishes, but added the optional 11th dish of persian black pearl caviar. very nice and the slices of bread lightly fried in butter took me back to my childhood. the whole thing cost ‚Ç¨100 per person (including wine, water and coffee). try it!"
"due to traffic jams, we arrived one hour late, but were nevertheless welcomed as if nothing had happened. the champagne was accompanied by three wonderfull appetizers, of which the macaron was a prize winner. we had the 5-corse menu, reasonably prized at 70‚Ç¨. the seabass was perfect, the revised paella with nobashi shrimp succulent. the lamb was cooked to perfection. the munster chesse came in a bouillon of pear and was accompanied by a foie gras burger. very original! the mango was served with yoghurt, lemon and wasabi: refreshing!. coffee was accompanied with a variety of sweets. service was perfect and the affordable winelist offers a vaste choice of non-french wines."
"we were at la trinit√© at the occasion of the promotion dining with the stars which means that we had a set menu.the dishes were absolutely an experience with a mixture of flavours and aromas. none of the courses were disappointing. the reception by a distinguished lady, the waiters and the sommelier added to the pleasure. the restaurant was absolutely full ,yet the service was perfect as a michelin starred place is expected to be. we selected our wines from the extensive wine list and were not disappointed. a place to be recommended and in fact: better than one star."
"this is what michelin inspectors really contribute: a star to a real gastronomic heaven. the service, starting already with the simple pouring of a simple beer by the somelier was already masterful and done with passion. every morsel of the food - from amuse bouche to the petit fours- was of superb gastronomic quality. you feel the delight with every bite. the wine recommendation was also superb. a dream of a meal! second star on the way...?"
"loungy atmosphere, beautiful modern & cosy interior. very friendly staff!  wonderful food, splendid combinations, just perfect!"
"great food, perfect wine selection and the best host, evelyn..!! :) 4 th time here, and always perfect."
"having read recent reviews of this restaurant, we were apprehensive but our fears were unfounded. we found the menu, all 6 courses of it, tasty and interesting, with different contrasts. the accompanying wines were particularly well chosen. the service was faultless. the restaurant was half full on a monday night and my only gripe was that in these conditions, i would have preferred the tables to be allocated without everyone being next to one another."
"recommended by a friend, we had quite high expectations of this place and luckily they were all met. the quality of the food was excellent, even though personally i wouldnt have mind slightly bigger portions (ackowledging that i do have a healthy appetit "
"great, modern, inventive cuisine in a very nice atmosphere. fine wines and top quality ingredien "
"this is one of the places we always wanted to do...but there are so many fantastic restaurants in our region. but now...well certainly come back here more than once !! the food quality is unique, tha products are fresh and the tastes remain natural...but there are so many tastes to discover in every dish ! and yes...in this restaurant you can relax, no stiffness, you can laugh and enjoy. the combination of quality and service in this fantastic athmosphere is unique. really a must for every lover of life and gastronomy !!! thank you very much evelyne and francois !!"
"this restaurant proves that cooking is a real art : an outburst of hidden flavours and textures with a great respect for each ingredient. as far as the food is concerned, it ll be in the running for a second michelin star, no doubt about it. a must experience for foodies, appreciating refinement in preparation and serving. its impossible to describe all the dishes because their food touches all the senses a human being has got. a revelation ! of course, its pricy, but you cant prepare it yourself at home because its the result of a continuous research on flavours and textures that match wonderfully how bizarre they may seem. i certainly will go back to discover more."
"unbeatable for quality, style and ambiance in the west zeeuwse valanderen!  although they only have one star in my opinion this one even beats the other 2 star restaurants in the region."
"last week we had lunch at la trinit√© in sluis, great experience ! the interior, the staff, the quietness in the open kitchen, and last but not least the fantastic food, we will be back for more !"
"i enjoyed a wonderful four course dinner with perfect wine pairings on a recent sunday evening in september. from the warm greeting at the front door, the professional, but friendly, caring staff, the smart, elegant, comfortable room, the delicious food that seemed to have a satisfying surprise with every bit, to the small things the staff did to elevate the dining experience and the goodbyes at the end of the evening la trinite over delivered every step of the way. i absolutely loved this restaurant."
"in the heart of sluis you will find this beautiful gem! it all starts with a warm hearted welcome of maitre de salle and owner, you get a warm handshake to welcome you at la trinit√©. what a lovely way to make genuine contact with your custome "
got a cadeaubox and wanted to try this restaurant. the service was very good (although it was the servers first day) and the food was excellent. well come again when in the neighbourhood.
"we called in here not really knowing what we wanted to eat and we settled for a beer (well it was a hot day and we were thirsty) and some french fries to nibble on. the waiter was friendly and spoke good english. we waited only a few minutes before he took our order and was back 5 minutes later with 2 large plates full of french fries. the cost, 10 euros for 2 beers and 2 plates of french fries. the restaurant is situated in the street that runs parallel to the main shopping street and leads to the canal."
"we stayed for two nights at de lindenhoeve (beautiful room, modern and cozy, great bad and bathroom - üëåüèª); and had dinner and breakfast there too. the only thing theyve missed was ramazzotti, but all the rest was just fine))"
"one of the best places in sluis. somewhat special waiters, you have to get used to, but compared to the rest in sluis friendly staff. good foor, allthough not very cheap."
"love this place, had coffe and hot chocolate with kids, really tasty. overall nice warm place. cant say anything about food."
had lunch on the large terrace in the back. looks like the place had a major refurbishment since the last time we visited a few years a 
we went to the restaurant/tearoom a few times during our recent stay in sluis. each time we had the same waiter. he remembered us from the first visit which was nice and he was extremely pleasant and friendly. we only went for drinks and cakes but found each visit enjoyab 
"i just went in for some tea and coffee, but they have a lot more to offer. for us, its the perfect stop for a small treat. the setting is absolutely beautiful and their service excellent. recommended!"
"great food , perfect wine selection and the best host, evelyn..!:) 3 time here and always perfect. the quality of the food was excellent! well certainly be back in the future."
"we had twice lunch there, during our holidays the week from 8th of june 20 "
"i think its one of the other best restaurants in town. and maby some get pissed. but thats the way of life. where in china(david bowie) crisis. the owners are hardworking people . having a nice parking. and aswell a nice place, if you like birds and that kind of thinks. and the food is very good .chapeau....im liken it."
"took a late lunch, swift service, cold and fresh beers, and ample wine list, food was good, tasty and flavorsome, served by joyce. a good choice for tapas"
"for us the terrace of kaai 10 stood out from the rest and looked inviting, with the green bushes and cosy furniture. great views and bathed in sunlight. with covid-19 in mind very practical idea with the menu printed on the paper place maths. the menu, besides classics, offers a wide variety of local specialities for lunch, dinner and dessert. we ordered one lunch special (salmon) the house burger and great coffee and delicious pancakes for dessert. despite the crowd, the service was very friendly and quick and the food very good. would definitely visit again!"
"i was visiting sluis and it started to rain and it was round lunch time, i had a choice of restaurants to pick from but picked kaai 10 and i was glad i did. the service by my server was excellent she helped me with translation from the menu which was in dutch, a language i do not speak. i had soup of the day which was courgette which i had never had before but it was good. for main course i had the club sandwich which was very big, i was not able to eat all of it unfortunately. i would certainly got to this restaurant again if i was in sluis."
had a great meal! it was truly fantastic! we opted for the suggestion of the day while my wife had the mussels! what a nice piece of fish for an amazing price. add a very friendly service in a really nice setting and you have a wonderfull experience for a good price!
we have been going there for years. a small menu but everything is excellent. they are especially good with the fish dishes but the vegetables are done so carefully that they are a treat in themselves. the staff have changed over the years but they are always attentive and polite. 
"petit par la taille, enoooorme par la qualite de ses moules, elles valent le grand detour !  small in size but huge for the top quality of its mussels ; this is definitely worth a long detour !"
"we had a very nice diner in this cosy restaurant with naturally friendly waiters. started with a screwdriver (with freshly squeezed orange juice !! üëç). all the starters were very good, i would certainly recommend the vitello tonato and the scallops. as main course we had an excellent selection of clearly fresh fish with excellent vegetables and different sauces for each fish, very nice. personally i would have preferred a bit more variety in vegetables and no chips. service was good but we had to wait a bit too long for the main course. overall a very good restaurant though üòÄüëã"
"our first visit ! nice experience. fresh food , good wine combined with a excellent service. what else..."
we had fish at kaai 10 and it seemed to be swimming out of the sea right onto our plate. very delicious...
"our third visit from u.k. as we consistently get good service, good atmosphere and very good food from this restaurant. we never visit brugge/sluis without visiting kaai 10."
"although the menu did look promising and both the service and the interior were really good, we just had tea. but even that was nicely presented."
this was a very nice experience in a fairly small restaurant on the local quay (hence the name kaai 10) in the touristy town of slu 
"we always visit here when in sluis, i recommend the lamb its absolutely delicious, followed by the chocolate pudding, which is baked to order. inside it has dark panelling and beautiful chandeliers with lots of candles, creating a very charming atmosphere. staff are always helpful and attentive."
"one of my preferred restaurants when visiting sluis, the well prepared fish plate, the excellent house wine, the atmosphere everything is ok"
"recommended to visit this restaurant by a restaurant owner in bruges who goes here regularly. pleasant atmosphere mainly local people using the restaurant which is usually a good sign. there was a good choice of food, a before 6p.m. menu then after 6 plus a comprehensive vegetarian menu. reasonably priced we ate the spaghetti bolognese which was very nice. staff were very friendly & helpful, definitely recommend & go again when in sluis."

"arrived here on a busy summer evening, outside seating area completely filled with people to enjoy the last of a sunny day. after our apero inside, a waiter made sure the next available table outside was ours. we tried the shrimps with pesto, tuna filet and mussels. all were perfectly cooked, service was very friendly. you can not expect anything more from this kind of pub food."

"visiting sluis, the netherlands we had to try the local cuisine which in this case was fries and mayo. they actually offer fries with about 20 other toppings, but in this neck of the wood, mayo is king! they were really, really good! a nice jupiler beer helped them digest. we would eat here again."

"very nice place, clean and friendly staff. portions were big, maybe little too big of you are not starwing. recommendations for this place!"
"my partner and i visited this restaurant for the first time on a rainy sunday evening in july whilst on vacation in the area. we thought it would be quiet but it seems the local population all eat out on sunday and it was packed. despite not having reserved a table, we were warmly welcomed and seated within minutes. the decor is over the top in an amusing way, all fake greek columns and trailing vines, the staff are efficient and friendly, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals. we both had one of the many combination dishes of grilled greek meat specialities, accompanied by tzatsiki, chips and salad. with garlic bread for starters, half a litre of red wine, coffees and the biggest measure of metaxa brandy ive ever seen, the bill came to about 52 euros for two. great value."
"lovely place, great food, very good service. the atmosphere they created makes you feel like youre in greece :-)"
amazing lunch at a wonderful restaurant with great owners.    fantastic value and simply amazing food.    we were lucky enough to have an experience where to chef made what he wanted from anything he chose.  just incredible.   thank you so much.
we went with friends from the area.  a great little place with fantastic service and the food quality was excellent.  definitely one to mark for a visit when you are in this area.

"a lovely location with fine dining outside. we had a large group and chose the set menu with win pairings which was 55 euros, an unbelievable value. presentation and flavors of the food match any michelin 1 star restaurant in my view. the wine pairings were excellent and for foodies in particular a good experienc "

"nestled on the singel in schipluiden, this quirky restaurant offers well presented organic meals. daily poultry, beef, fish, pork or vegetarian options change according to chefs inspiration and availability. relaxed, friendly yet professional waitrons add to dining experience. a good selection of wines are offered to compliment courses. in summer the terrace opens onto the canal in quaint schipluiden and in winter there is a lovely cosy ambience."
"we ate here last night as a group of four and had a wonderful evening.  we had the chefs surprise and were delighted by each and everyone of our courses.  good ambience and friendly, informative, attentive (if rather slow) service."
we arrived in schipluiden and found this lovely restaurant was just metres away from our b & b. this building had a former life as a church then as a garage and now it is a licenced restauran

"cycled from delft to this restaurant . had an excellent lunch on the sunny back terrace. very tasty, interesting salad (with flowers) and sandwiches made with organic produce , which is the restaurants main selling point. the restaurant has a plot at the back where it grows herbs etc. not expensive .staff very helpful and friendly. restaurant set in an attractive old building"
it is located at a very nice spot. we really enjoyed coffee and tea. the terrace is nicely located close to the waterside.mfriendly staff.
"we did visit indigo often but just to drink some coffee. because of a very good review in the local newspaper we decided to go for dinner and we were not desappointed at all. they have a 3 course menu for 27,50‚Ç¨ and you can choose from the whole menucard. we only took a main course and it was very good, very tasty. they do offer goose on the menu and my husband did choose, it was also very tasty and quit a new experience and probably we both will choose it next time. indigo offers most biological vegtables, meat, cheese and so on. worth a visit."

"we had the surprise menu, an appetizer and three courses. taste is excellent, the menu has variation and imagination built in. the price was quite reasonable."

"our second visit to paviljoen t middelpunt, for dinner. the restaurant is located on a nice spot at the waterfront in schipluiden. ample free parking is available along the dorpsstraat, opposite the total petrol station. we noticed that the interior was spruced up since our last visit. service of the staff was polite, modest and dedicated. waiting times were just fine. we enjoyed a three course menu. i had chosen fish dishes for starter and main course. the dishes were well prepared and flavours were perfectly balanced. the shared side dishes of fries and salad were a bit skimpy for two persons. unfortunately, prices are of an ambitious level, not uncommon in dutch restaurants, but on a high level compared with neighbouring european countries. fortunately, paviljoen t middelpunt is active on the voucher web site of social deal, where discounted vouchers can be obtained, making the bill far more palatable."
"lovely waitress .. first impressions count! well located, just off the highway and at the entrance of the village, but _at_ _the_ _waterside_. they forgot one order, but the it was a very warm day ..  a place to remember."
"to be realistic, in the dutch restaurant landscape, prices at paviljoen t middelpunt are moderate, but seen in an more european scene, prices are high, compared with similar establishments in west european countries. but enough of that. we were of course armed with discounted internet vouchers, indispensable in the quest for value for money. paviljoen t middelpunt in schipluiden is situated nicely on the bank of the small river gaag. the wood and glass building with areas for outdoor seating is very inviting. parking is free along the road. the interior is simple and clean. one point of critic is, that an additional door to the toilet area would greatly improve the atmosphere. behind a large counter the open kitchen is situated; a very dedicated and competent chef is presiding over the pots and pans. the counter doubles also for obtaining take-away food. my three course menu consisted of carpaccio (unfortunately the dutch variety, with loads of salad leaves heaped on the beef slices. but when i had eaten away the salad leaves, the beef was tender and tasty. even the capers were rinsed!); the main course was tuna steak with fries and roasted potatoes (well prepared and tasty; tuna steak is one of the most difficult dishes to prepare) and the dessert was some sort of chocolate and ice cream with meringue contraption (delicious). so high marks for the chef. the table service was done competently by a well educated waitress; however, without real hospitality. generally speaking the visit to paviljoen t middelpunt was very satisfactory and memorably."
it was our first night in this neighbour and we didnt know where to eat. than we find this restaurant. a lot of people came here and the dinner was good; enough and tastes good good goooood. you can go here if you like greeks food. perfect.
great food and a good atmosphere. it looks nice and the people working here are fast and friendly. the food is high quality and tasty.
"this is a very nice restaurant with friendly staff, a great location and tasty food. the decor is exposed beams and welcoming and my friend and i had a really lovely evening. we were seated in a small booth which allowed some privacy but did not leave us out of the general atmosphere. the only issue we had is that they wouldnt accept a card and i had to go to the cash machine, but this may have been a temporary problem. it is worth asking when booking your table though..."

"a real pleasure. delicious simple italian food in a pleasant atmosphere. a top vitello tonnato and superb grilled lamb. decent quality chardonnay at an affordable price. light, airy, cosy decor. owner came to our table to see if all was ok. all-in-all good food at good value with attentive service."
"nice italian food. very generous portions. decor a bit old fashionned, maybe. cuisine is classical italian food, well prepared and served in generous portions. we especially liked the carpaccio, the lasagna and the basilicum cr√®me br√ªl√©e."
"had dinner here in july 2016. there is a nice, big terrace in front of the restaurant. we first had a drink at this terrace before we went inside. we had a nice table in the patio. the outside area on th backside of the restaurant is protected from rain and win "
"very nice experience. the place looks very cute, the food was very tasty, i highly recommend their vegetarian options."
two girlfriends and i enjoyed snacks and wine on the terrace overlooking the busy canal. service was speedy and with a smile and the snack was tasty. it is the perfect place to while away a few hours with friends on a summer evening.
"it is hard, if no impossible, to find genuine italian food abroad. and here you are...in the middle of nowhere, adjacent to a vacation resort, pops up this place that gets pretty close to the real thing. of course, they cater to a vast majority of dutch and german tourists and they have to keep that into account. but still: the pastas a pretty close to the original recipes, the pizzas are as close as youll get in holland and - believe it or not - even the espresso is a genuine, italian tasting espresso, as opposed to the muck one gets served too often in the netherlands. so bravo all over. biggest disappointment: kitchen closes extremely early."
fairly good italian food. the large round tables were well suited for group conversations during dinner. the food was served quickly after ordering. i could recommend the spaghetti corbonara and the saltimbocca with fries as a side dish.
"nice restaurant next to the complex office. friendly staff,and a good menu for all tastes. the lasagna was excellent. good choice of wines by the glass. friendly staff."
nice & quit place to have some ice cream and or coffee. very friendly staff with good service. i would recommend them and i would go back for some more ice cream.
"very good italian restaurant in the city center of drunen. the food is just amazing, so are the wines. service is super friendly and has lots of knowledge. and all this for very reasonable prices.  you can call this a hidden gem of drunen."
there used to be a different restaurant on this spot but since a while there is an italian restaurant at the corner of the central square in drunen and it is more plush than the name la cantina suggests. it has nice seats and tables for different sizes of parties and only when you are with 6 or more people it is necessary to make a reservation. in front of the restaurant there is also a big terrace outside overlooking the square with plenty of sunshine (because it is situated southward 
"nice place, central location.  the bigest amount of the clients are from older ages. nice ideas for lunch."
we were there for a quick lunch and yes this place was worth a visit > the food was good and we all liked it > the staff were friendly and the decor of the place was nice > a relaxed atmosphere> they also have a good outdoor sitting also but as it was cold that afternoon so we preferred to sit inside
we went to this place to have a lunch to celebrate my wifes birthday. when we arrived all tables outside with some shade were occupied so that we went in but after a couple left we still could sit outside. with a bit of wind the seating outside was pleasant and we were quickly served with some drinks and selected our lunch dish. because of the temperature we selected both a different salad and this was served about 15 minutes later. the plate did not look too big but after finishing it we found it well proportioned and also very tasty. we really enjoyed it and the place has a wide variety of dishes also for lunch at very reasonable prices. they are also one of the few places on the central square open on monday which is clever as their competitors are all closed. the location is very central close to parking places and in a very lively spot so that there is always something to look around.
relaxed atmosphere. good variety of food at reasonable prices. at busy times you can experience sometimes some longer waiting times when ordering your drinks or meals. friendly staff.
service was excellent food has improved since my last visit. staff is experienced and flexible! lot of things are possible if you want to adapt the menu! worth a visit!
when the weather is good its a great place to sit on the terrace.  good food. only sad thing is that the menu only changes 1 time a year.  if it offers more and frequent variations i would be dining here more often.
great italian food where you wouldnt expect it. nice views of the river in the summer and terrace. you may need to book though. the food was great and affordable.
"nice ambiance, good service, nice people, a bit crowded but thats normal if the food is good, good wine too btw."

"this was our 2nd visit, last year we had lunch in the building opposite, which wasnt that nice. we really like the new restaurant, its spacious, very cosy, love their industrial lights, and its very clean! the menu didnt change from our last visit; omelettes, baguettes, burgers, snacks and more traditional brasserie dishes, but no change in quality, very nice meal in good portions and at a very friendly price. the lady waiting on our table was really very friendly! my only tip would be to lose the stapled menu and get something more up to the image of the hotel, apart from that i wouldnt change thing, see you next year!!!"
we stopped just for a coffee.  the place was busy but we were made very welcome and staff were friendly and helpful.  lovely location in the town square beside the harbour.  coffee came quickly and was decent.  the apple cakes looked lovely... wish we had!
we were part of a large group that stopped for coffee. service was great.friendly multilingual staff made us feel very welcome.

we had an evening party at the soete suikerbol organized by friends of ours. the location is suitable for this with a medium sized hall available. staff was very pleasant and service was great. sufficient parking available as well. music could not be very loud due to concerns for the neighborhood.

"ive been going to brasserie brocante once a week for 4 weeks now after my physio treatment in pijnacker. right from the start, i was very pleased with the food and the service. they have a cosy terrace out front that is enclosed with glass for the chillier days but can be opened up when warm weather arrives. for early in the day, i suggest their good value coffee and pastry deal; ive now tried their scones with jam and whipped cream as well as their large cream puff cut in half and filled with whipped cream and strawberries, both amazing."

"we enjoyed a very nice evening in this restaurant. both our menus were fantastic, with delicious dishes, accompanied by a nice selection of wines. staff was attentive and kind. i really enjoyed the local products menu with items sourced from the groene hart region. can definitely recommend this restaurant. they even have a hotel part, so you dont have to drive home (if you book a room, that is)."
this was our second stay and we were not disappointed. room as requested with the best view over the lake. food was sublime. staff helpful and friendly. all spoke the most excellent english. thank you - we will return!
"being on a bike trip for a week, we had no say as to where we stayed. but, this place was very special and not something we would have found on our own. our last two nights in the netherlands, the hotel was remote, quiet, located on a beautiful lake setting. the food was amazing, the staff accommodating, the room very spacious and well appointed. would recommend it to anyone!"
our family based in holland booked this hotel for us last minute as we had a family funeral to attend in the are 
"chef sjanie de geus is a phenomenon in the netherlands. great food, for a great price with equally fabulous view."
"we have just returned from the most fantastic weekend at de watergeus. we took a special arrangement les plus belles extra and booked a large room overlooking the lake. our room turned out to be a small apartment, with cooking facilities, a sitting room and separate bedroom. the whole was accompanied by a double balcony, festoned with colourful plants, overlooking the lake. all the rooms have mosquito netting, so there is adequate protection and our bed, certainly, was very comfortable. we had an electric boat ride with wine and delicious happy bites for the trip on,our first afternoon. on the second day we had a packed lunch and were given good bikes to discover the area. the restaurant itself provides the most delicious food and the wine list is comprehensive and not too expensive. we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
our food was very good. the wine list extensive. the view was beautiful overlooking the lake. we had pre drinks outside but it became too cold. the service and meal was delicious.
"made a reservation for my birthday and was contacted beforehand by the restaurant with questions about my allergy for nuts. very impressed! when we arrived, i ordered the 5-course surprise meal and my husband ordered 3 courses. waiter suggested to serve my husbands 3-courses in such a way that he would have something to eat for every course of my 5-course meal! the food was delicious, and the location of the restaurant is very nice indeed! well be back!"
"spacious, comfortabable restaurant with panoramic view of the lake. the michelin menu of ‚Ç¨ 36 excellent value for money wtih fresh, tasty produce and good combinations. perfect service."
"a special place at the borders of the lake. run by mother and daughter de geus, elegant with a great outerspace for spring and summer, good price quality relation with respect to diners and lunches. possible to harbour your boat and enjoy a late afternoon there."
"the location of this restaurant along the lakes of nieuwkoop is no less than magnificent. it is quite an experience to sip on a glass of cava while enjoying the sight of terns, grebes and even the rare purple her "
"we were attended to de watergeus by salmon-smokers rien and ingrid heemskerk. they supply watergeus with their products, and the menu indeed featured, as one of the dishes, three preparations of bawykov salmon. we had a 4-course dinner that offered a lot of variation. service was attentive, as you may expect of this class of restaurants. the restaurant has a great view over the tranquil nieuwkoopse plassen lake. we also stayed over for the night; the rooms were fairly simple in 70s style, but appropriate. after all, you come for the food. next day, the breakfast (which you pay extra) was very good, and allowed us to enjoy the view on lake again. an illustration of the hospitality that de watergeus offered was that my wife liked the small pillows that were provided in the bedrooms - on our depart, the staff happily provided us one for free."
"de watergeus is situated in a little village in the heart of holland. beautifully located on the border of the nieuwkoopse plassen (lake). from both the restaurant and the terrace, you have a direct view of the lake. in summertime you can also rent an electric boat to go on the lake (which we di "
"situated in natural region between small lakes. i had a nice room overlooking the garden, a very good tasting dinner - beautifull terras overlooking the lake - and had a good sleeping in the comfortable room. starting into the next day i enjoyed a marvelous dutch-breakfast. i enjoyed this hotel and ill return again!!!!!"
"we stayed at the watergeus for two nights while on a bike trip through the netherlands. the hotel is in a good location situated on a lake; the restaurant has a really scenic view right by the water. we ate two dinners and two breakfasts there. i would rate the food pretty-very good as there were many good courses. though the room we stayed in was just ok, i would recommend the hotel de watergeus for travelers to this part of the netherlands."
i have been 2 times to this restaurant and both times have been lovely experiences the 2nd time i took my mother and husband we took a boat ride in one of their whisper boats although a little chilly it added to our appetite and enjoyment of these lovely suroundings the food is tops the view wonderfu 
"we stayed here for two days and had a very small room (really small!) that overlooked the lake and it was really a beautiful view. summer probably has issues with mosquitoes, so you do have to be careful and always keep the screens closed. it was a truly lovely and peaceful place, with an excellent, caring staff. the little staircase to the rooms would be an issue for anyone with a balance issue or disability, but they helped to bring up the suitcas "
"we stayed 2 nights as part of a bike tour. our room did not face the lake, too bad, the wifi was spotty at best in our room, but the meals more than made up for the weaknesses here. the room we had was large, clean, in need of new carpet, comfortable. food is definitely the draw here."
"we stayed at this restaurant and hotel during our last two days with van gogh tours. i think there are nine rooms at this place which are comfortable and clean. our room overlooked the lakes but there are other rooms that overlook the garden. the staff was very gracious and attentive. breakfast and dinner were excellent (we had lunch elsewhere). breakfast was served at the table with yogurt, selections of bread, fruit, cereal, egg, coffee and teas. dinner was always delicious and beautifully plated. we also rented an electric boat from the hotel and enjoyed the water."

"whilst staying in zandvoort, we decided to pop to the nearest supermarket (which happened to be in overveen), having stocked up, we went for a wander around this charming village. we stumbled on stach and it straight away it looked worth a try. the place was busy but we found a table and opted for the burger menu meals. all were delicious and son 2, commented on the best burger ever, (i couldnt disagre "
"we hear this used to be a cycle shop. now its a gourmet food stop of sorts with a nice restaurant in there. there is inside/outside seating, its got a very cool feel to it. we pretty much went burgers, fries and salads. its tasty. fun beer choices. its a little town and this is a great place to get fed. always looks busy in a good way. if i was passing thru id double date stach with lucianos ice cream. only gripe, parking is tough. "
stache foods are fantastic! variety that s different than regular restaurants tourists flock to. healthy foods
"we eat there often. the burgers, fries, and salad combo is among the best i have eaten. the owner researched the east coast of the u.s. to refine the recipe."
"i always go to stach in amsterdam. this place always has great takeaway lunch like the goats cheese salad, the warm meatball sandwich and freshly baked bread. very nice that overveen has stach too, yummie!"
we went for a coffee and some cakes during the afternoon. everything was delicious! we loved the cappuccinos. the place is very nice!
"the service is good and the food as well. slightly disappointed at the lack of salads on the menu - im a salad eater. there are a few though. there are nice items for take away if youre looking for a meal to take with you later. cappuccinos are delicious as are the chocolate bars they sell by the cash register. besides the salads, no complaints!"
"tipical hip restaurant and really nice interior. nice tap beers and fresh food (for take away as well), the only negative point is that the menu for dinner is short in warm dishes. i will be back!"
"this restaurant gives you a feeling of being in a tropical country where a ll things are possible. just lay back and enjoy the nice atmosphere in the restaurant, the food on the original menu, lovely drinks and the s "
friendly staff and nicely located at the beach. we had some drinks and snacks in corona-time and it was well managed.
"we stumbled in from the cold into a place that made us forget the constant threat of stress. as we sat around a swell fire for a coffee and a hot chocolate we noticed the colourful surroundings in surprising and interesting architecture, the friendly staff and an international yet unpretentious menu made us decide us to stay for dinner. we unwinded and shifted into relaxmode and sat happily gazing at a glorious sunset. food was fine, so was the wine. had a great time."
this is one of the nicest restaurants we have been to.  the decoration and laid back ambience is great and the food is delicious.
the decoration is just really beautiful. if you are nearby it is definitely worth the visit. it is pet friendly and they even have a pet parrot . food is delicious and it came out really quickly. the owner martine is the best!
"i am responsible for a run of a smaller family business and this weekend has been unexpectedly full for us. now i see this huge restaurant running as it can, all people are smiling, the staff is super friendly,..i have to give them compliments for doing what they do in a weekend when the weather still shouldnt be how it is. thumbs upüëåüèº"
"all the other pavilions were gone, so we took our chance at the san blas. it was nice. the fire in the center, the view of the sea and the parrot walking around. lovel "
"love this place for a quick bite or a drink after walking through the kennemerduinen! they have a pretty extensive menu, the food is very good, and its a huge place so you can always find a seat. its also great in the winter, to watch the sea from a cosy indoor space."
"we went here on a saturday early morning. the perfect time to have a bit of this place and the beach for yourself, as it was soon getting crowded. we ordered some lunch and were relaxing at one of the many places where you can hang out in this place. the service is great, and the decoration very lovely. it only took a little while every time we ordered something before we got it."
we booked this restaurant as we were staying nearby. there were fifteen of us and we had a private room. after a shaky start we were allocated our own waitress. after that it was fantastic. everyone loved their food - we had a mix of snacks and mains and they were all great. the ambience was nice and the staff friendly. i recommend it. 
"love the healthy and yammie food, not the typical beach club meals. the costa rica interior makes me always feel very positive and happy, espacially during the winte "
"just a brief stop for a coffee. the whole vibe is very laid back so don‚Äôt visit if you are in a rush. otherwise sit back, enjoy the view and wait for your coffee. it is worth it"
"this restaurant is more catered for for lunch and snacks then diner. they only have a 3 choice maincourse menu but an extensive salad menu. the food is well prepared and slads are large the staff is ok, not overtly friendly, but all in all its an ok place"
"lovely surroundings, very friendly staff and great coffee. there was a wide choice of seats and blankets for sitting outside. it was just a shame we didnt have more time to spend as i could have easily spent the day chilling out."
"early march, the sun is out and temperature is friendly until laten in the afternoon. san blas is a great place on the dutch beach not far from zandvoort which attracts many visitors for both drinks and dinner. we visited with our family of 15 members and they gave us a fantastic room with a spectacular view on the sea sinking in the sea. the food is just right for this location with a choice of salads, fish and meat"
"we had cycled through the dunes the long way, stopped in at parnassia aan zee for a drink and then arrived at bloemendaal aan zee for lunch. great menu, excellent outdoor area on a hot sunny day, with very friendly and speedy service. i ordered falafels with an interesting salad mix on a large pita. excellent value for money. hubby had a croquet, which was ok. kids enjoyed their spring rolls and nachos. lots of vegetarian options. very glad we found this place to refresh after riding 20 kms. would definitely come back. "
"stopped in for lunch before hitting the beach when we arrived in bloemendaal aan zee. nice vibe with good music. service was a bit slow, but the food was really good. we really enjoyed the salads (both the goat cheese and the salmon & shrimp), and younger daughter liked the chicken satay, although the sides with that were curried, which she didnt care for. "
"we had cycled from zandvoort to haarlem through the national park. we decided to take a detour on the way back and go and have a look at bloemendaal. there wasnt much there - a hotel, seaview apartments, a couple of bars and a fantastic beach... with bars and restaurants... including them is san blas. what a gem of a place. we had a couple of drinks sheltered from the wind by the perspex breaks but we were well looked after. not expensive and could have sat there all day. a short (4k) cycle back to zandvoort alongside the beach and we were well satisfied with our day out."
san blas is the only restaurant on the bloemendaal beach what is open the whole ye 
"when looking at de koornmolen, a restaurant is not to be expected to be too fancy. however, in this case there is an exception. a fair menu, with not too many choices, but a nice variety, offers me some good choices. drinks are available in all ranges. location is nicely styled. the service is doing well, friendly and sharp. food tasted good. vegetables are to be found on your plate and it shows that the cook knows his job. prices are fair. went here two times in a week. well done."
"what a beautiful relaxing place to stay and eat ! we arrived casually , but it was definitely a perfect decision to sta "
"the menu is not very extensive, but the food is good. the staff is very friendly and always trying to do their best. would recommend this restaurant."
"visiting this restaurant once every month and can recommend it to anyone. the restaurant offers a limited number of dishes, which makes it easy to decide what you want to eat. the meals are all very nice, staff extremely friendly and they serve excellent wines. together with a the option to enjoy your dinner inside or outside on the terras and a perfect price-quality balance, makes this a perfect choice for your romantic or family dinners."
what a dream! this is the most italian part of italy in the netherlands. it is hidden quite well so you must really know where you‚Äôre going but it is absolutely worth the effort. we had spaghetti with shrimps and a pizza. i was blown away by the refined taste. we sat outside in the lovely garden where fresh herbs and spices are grown. the garden is a 1000 square meter representation of heaven. should you be in neighbouring zoetermeer or gouda - make sure you‚Äôll venture out to buon gusto in moerkapelle. trust me : it will be a night to remember!
"this medium-sized restaurant is a hidden gem in moerkapelle. looking for some ice-cream on a sunny afternoon, we stumbled upon an ice-cream cart with a tastefully decorated outside area and restaurant behind it. olive and oak trees were growing, with nice tables and parasols in between. at the back is a small wooden cubbyhouse for the children and an elaborate herb and flower garden where you can walk through. the staff are friendly and happy to make a chat. the ice-cream was nice and cheap, although you do get quite a small portion and there are only 4 choices, but the children were happy with it. we had a cappuchino and a coffee latte, both tasteful. in the end, it turned out to be a great place to have a break and relaxed time with the kids. for a moment it feels like you step out of holland and straight into romantic italy :-)"
de tintel tuin is a very pretty well kept garden with heaps of flowers in all different beds. there is also beautiful art in the garden. this art is for sale. they have a half open shed where you can have a cup of coffee as well as a decent lunch. they also have a nice terrace a bit away from the sh 
this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch genuine food local produce and even more friendly and personal service lovely nature walks and breakfast in nature you must go there
we went here for a family dinner and it was delicious! service and atmosphere were great too. prices a little expensive but it was worth every penny.
my family and i went here today and were pleasantly surprised by being served by a wonderfully cheerful lady who spoke to us in english in an english accent (it seems her mother is english 
i dont eat grain or sugar. the staff did their best to make a great dinner for me. they were helpful and made me a great dish. during our time in eersel we ate twice there because of this. recommend them
using this restaurant for lunch sandwiches. excellent selection and variety of rolls and sandwiches or french baguettes. always fresh ingredients and prepared while you wait. one sandwich is a full meal on its own!
"friendly helpful staff who take time to help explain the menu., good food selection is just right for ether late breakfast or light lunch. very good value all dishes are well thought out . menu in both dutch and english. we went for lunch as a family two adults and two teenagers. but this is not a place just for families, lots of locals of all ages. chairs and tables outside as well as inside."
visited with daughter on a weekday. we had lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality. the service was first class and the outdoor seating area was nice and clean and facing a small square. recommended.
nice place for a good meal for an cheep prise. friendly staff who try to make for jou a nice evening
"don‚Äôt expect haute cuisine, the menu is not very surprising. nevertheless, the food is delicious and well prepared for a good price."
"for lunch or dinner, their salads are great. ive tried them all and every time i loved it! and the staff is very friendly. 5 stars :)"
"these guys are the friendliest in town, and nothing is too much trouble for them. a lovely little local place, good for pub food and a nice drink with friends. a little old fashioned on the interior but it‚Äôs eersel not eindhoven!"
"driving to germany to see my daughter, but wanted to have a stop off for spot of lunch....after studying map looked at eersol in holland...looks like a nice town and just of main route....pulled off junction and easy to find town, but if your stopping with a car then you will need a disc to display time as you are allowed 2 hours to park as most locals use there bikes, we where lucky a local gave us there disc as they had 2.....very nice people in eersol, after we parked we walked about, not many shops to explore but a lovely town, so pretty and a friendly town, we came across this resaurant after checking out the others but i liked the look of the food people was having....they had a menu in english which made it easy and staff polite, you can sit inside but was a sunny and warm day when we visited so sat outside alongside the road, not busy with cars but alot of cycles, i had a seafood salad and wow i loved every part of it, the whole family enjoyed eating here, check out my photo....the prices wasnt too bad as the quality of food was very good and staff always on hand to clear tables of serve drinks, very clean inside and out.......car parking not too far away which free........i would highly recommend stopping off in this town and having a spot of lunch just wonder if the other restaurants are as good as this....just across the road pop over for some ice cream....next time i drive to germany i will came back here for lunch.......happy eating.."
went there for a quick lunch for work. their card gives a good variety of lunch options. they serve both hot and cold lunch dishes. good value for your money.
"we have eaten here four times now during two separate trips to the netherlands. we have not been disappointed on any occasion. theres a good selection on the menu to choose from and if your dietary requirements are a little complicated then the young, cheerful staff will ensure youre accommodated wherever possible. the portions are large so theres no fear of leaving hungry! there are many places to eat in eersel but this restaurant made life easy by having menus written in english! our dutch runs only to saying good morning and thank you, for which we should be ashamed. we have recommended this restaurant to others and we will return again on our next trip to the area."
in dinee-cafe veertien they give good quality and good service. enough choice for different meals and drinks.
weve visited this restaurant with relatives. we had a nice evening out. the food was pretty good as was the service. we made a reservation as it was sunday and then the restaurant is always packed. weve been here before last year. the restaurant keeps up the quality and good service! defenitely would recommend this restaurant.
"visiting this place with some relatives. it is one of the many restaurant and caf√©s you can find around eersels markt and they are offering a nice, small selection of food. the place has this special dutch cosines and inside it is rather big. while we were visiting it was not so crowded, so noise levels were perfect to have a conversation. the staff is very young and attentive, drinks and food were served in time. the food is very nice and was tasting well. maybe the portions are a bit big, we had more than enough to eat. it was a nice evening out. prices were average, for dutch standar "
this place was recommended by our air bnb host and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!   we ended up having 3 courses as the food was so good.  the staff were friendly and happy to translate the menu for us.  would definitely recommend.
it was a surprise to be called back on our reservation. since we had asked for a quiet spot because of our fahter who is a little deaf and old 
"been here a few times, food and staff are good, drinks are nice, service is great..we will be back again.."
"we ate at tok tok on the recommendation of our bed and breakfast landlady. the staff received us warmly and offered to translate the menu into english. the food was delicious and good value for money, plenty of choice. we didnt manage a dessert but they looked very enticing. "

we had great diner with my businesspartner. thank you chef micha for the delicious food. good place to eat for a couples and bussines people. hvala / thank you
super restaurant near the b&b i was staying in landsmeer. friendly fun waitstaff and great reasonable food in a nice atmosphere.
highly recommend this place to people that want to spend a lovely evening together. the service is very nice and the pace in which they serve the food gives you the ability to enjoy each others company without feeling rushed.
"great food and service!!  we looked at the menu but the waiter recommended we go for the special.  this was awesome advise and it was a delicious multi course meal with smoked salmon, beef tartar and some other great food"
"beautiful surroundings and view, outside seating is wonderful. next to bicycle and hiking trails & routes. mostly self service"
"what a delightful find the perfect lunch stop on my way through. being an orangery it is light and airy tastefully furnished with a stunning view of the gardens  the food, coffee and welcoming staff are all good."
"during the summer months - in the winter the orangerie is used for its original purpose: housing of the plants - the orangerie is a beautiful location for a lunch. fantastic terrace view. self service. high quality food, many fresh ingredients. most choices are so eur 6 - eur 8. so price worth. located in the rosendael castle parc."
"just had the club sandwich, dutch style and it was really great!  the staff are really friendly.  great location"
"after walking around in this small village we stopped at this restaurant for a warm chocolate and what snack. good service, quick and friendly staff. the fries made from the local beemsterpotatoes and it was good."
"friendly people and atmosphere. made reservation by phone few days ahead. had a enthousiastic conversation. at our arrival few days after, the owner herself received us with referral to our conversation. very personal touch, we definitly will return asap!"
i love coming here for dinner. the fantastic atmosphere makes it a pleasure to come here. they serve great pancakes but also great meat and fish dishes. everything i prepared with quality products and i can definitely advise anyone around in the area to pay them a visit.
great dinner very good nice place for dinner. also for lunch very good. it is a very good restaurant so we regular guests.
"max and liesbeth work with local, seasonal products in their open plan kitchen. food is wonderful, the staff that serves are a delight (son and daughter). an excellent, local restaurant, well worth the visit if you are in de neighbourhood. local beer (beemster) on tap. on wednesdays they have specials on too, very affordable, but call ahead..."
"very nice building, easy parking. simple interior, dominated by a bar, room will hold 30 to 45 persons. pleasant staff. short menu, maybe stronger at lunch than dinner items, but sufficient choice to accommodate different tastes. superb salads, with a touch of creativity (grilled pineapple!) and a well chosen balance of tastes. chef gives clear preference to locally produced products. spanish coffee brand pleased all of us and the homemade walnut pie that came with it was fantastic: restrained in sweetness and super-fresh. nicely priced."
"we had a lot of time to kill in the amsterdam airport. we saw some tables and chairs next to the caf√© comunal. the area was completely full. we saw a lady getting ready to leave, and we asked if we could have her table and she said, ‚Äúof course.‚Äù we went to the counter and ordered a coke zero and a bottle of water. it was just what we needed. we did think the price of ‚Ç¨ 8+ was on the high sid "
this a small and nice convenience store with a variety of beverages - hot and cold.  the prices are reasonable.  good place to get grab and go stuff quickly.
"very busy. quick service. food quality - the pits! mcdonalds is better quality, according to my husband! i asked for glass of water and was referred to drinks cabinet. i confirmed that i wished ‚Äòglass of water‚Äô - referred to the bar. i had the buzzer with me and asked again for 2 glasses of tap water; once again, i was referred to bottled water cabinet - i asked if it was free and she confirmed it was not. i said i want tap water, she asked if i had paid for the meal - taking note that i had buzzer in my hand! i kept cool, said yes, and she gave me the tap water. someone a bit less forthright might have paid!!! avoid this place like the plague! got fish n chips - it was like fish bites that had been battered umpteen times. not a lot of places to eat as it was a sunday evening"
"flying out through amsterdams schiphol airport, stopped of at hmshost for a morning cafe latte. nice caf√© latte in schiphol airport, though very much over-priced as youd expect in an international airport. no gluten free food options. service was ok."
"good food, healthy, fresh and fast.  not overly priced considering the venue. nothing else to add. nothing selse, nothing else, nothing else."
"great meal on a stopover, so nice service. jan, our bartender, has a great conversation! feels like we are at our local bar! at the airport, unbelievable!"
"had a salmon and avocado on toast and it was obviously made with care and pride, despite it being towards the end of the shift.  nasek, thanks, will be back."
"perfect for a quick breakfast and the coffee was delicious! the prices were reasonable. our server was attentive and friendly. this place is spacious and has plenty of seating. overall, very good for a quick bite!"
"as famished travellers on our journey home, it was a pleasant surpise to be able to find a good old english breafast serv "
"as far as quick food places go in airports, hms host is a bit better than the average. they offer a lot of choices for varying diets as well as serving beer for breakfast. i opted for coffee this time around. i choose the three egg omelet for 8.95 euro. it came with eggs cooked perfectly, two hash browns, three sausages, two strips of bacon and a side of beans. everything was very good. where i would criticize them is in the size of the beans. it came in a cup the size they use to give you pills in a hospital. i would be surprised if it amounted to a tablespoon. i wanted to be like oliver and go back up to the counter and simply state, please, sir, i want some more. otherwise, i really enjoyed my meal."
"i had scrambled eggs and panini, and both were quite good. i was surprised at how good they were for a fast-food place in an airport. staff were friendly."
we got sandwiches and coffee here.  we also got a sausage roll. really enjoyed the sandwiches.  the dutch cheese one was unreal good. coffee was good too. amsterdam bread company really has good bread.
for an airport food restaurant this was a high quality establishmen 
"we decided that we would eat at the airport before we boarded our flight and chose this place, which was actually surprisingly good for an airport. we had a couple of toasties, a dutch and a goat‚Äôs cheese one, and a glass of wine ea "
the hms host bar at schiphol has a very friendly bartender. when we were there so was darius rucker. he was left at peace. very professional
"we had burgers and club sandwich here, all very tasty. fresh juice was also good. the prices? high but this is an airport restaurant."
"sometimes its challenging to find decent food at the airports, i like the variety in this restaurant. las time i had a miso soup with udon noodles and shrimp, and that was actually really tasty! it was a little on the expensive side though - 14.70eur."
had hot drinks and a slice of pizza. it was all very good but airport prices. pizza portions are reheated when you order.
"i was here before the departure and bought excelent chocolate piece. they have white, milk and dark chocolate that is cutted to the same pieces. you can give a gift bag and put  the chocolate pieces in it. highly recommended dark chocolate."
"airport food is never great but the harvest market in the d gates has a good selection of basic hot and cold foods. pizza, wraps, pies, smoothies, beer. if you fancy mixing things up this place offers quite a few options. can get busy, but there is plenty of seating. "
early(earl) and i7 eelco are the best hosts ever :)) they feel you welcomed . i had a great time. thanks again  mia
i had a dutch burger with some chips. thoroughly enjoyed it. the price wasnt bad as well. thank you maurice
"my husband needed to get a quick bite prior to continuing our journey to the rhine river cruise. he ordered the sausage roll at 3.55 and coke 3.35 which was a fair price for an airport. it was very good, hot and fresh. in fact on our way back to the states, he stopped by and got another sausage roll. a good quick stop on the run."
everything in the airport is fast moving and busy. this restaurant adapts to the crowds by opening more tills. easy to use but a bit of a struggle getting round with your stuff and carrying a tray. very helpful staff and nice juice and coffee. this is my regular at this airport.
called in for breakfast good service. ordered coffee this was also good had breakfast this was a lot of food but cooked and tasted very good
"if you are in a hurry at schipol airport and waiting to catch a flight, this is just the place if you want to have  bite. nice variety especially the sandwitches."
"i eat here during my layover and found that at least their yakitori was good. actually suprisingly good for airport food. it wasnt super cheap, but not expensive either. also it was really quiet place to wait for my plane."
"to our surprise, the beef b√ºrger with frites was more than excellent. the price was okay. very friendly people."
"located in the main concourse at the schipol airport, this is a great place to pick up a fresh dutch lunch and sandwich after your flight. i was staying at the sheraton airport hotel and found it convenient to walk back into the airport to enjoy lunch at this location. "
"for a grab-and-fly experience, that was just ok. however, i did not tempt fate as to order more advanced food sold as simili-asian, as trust did not build in my brain. in any case, i would not dare to try their kind of exotic dutch sus "
"when walking around looking for asian food for breakfast, we saw this restaurant has very good looking sashimi and sushi, so we decided to walk in and give it a tri "
hms host is decent place to enjoy nice coffee and meal on the go while waiting for your flight at schiphol airport.
"easy to transport on plane, definitely a step above airline food, very fast and friendly service.  worth a stop!"
had good green curry with great service by sunate! she was very helpful . easy to order by tablet ...
"freshly prepared food was very tasty including the salads. tuna mayo rolls were filled to overflowing. just a pity they had no white wine, had to make do with red. staff very friendly and efficient."
they made an excellent breakfast of 2 eggs and bacon.  the hamburger was excellent too.  was very happy with the food from a place at the airport.
"first visit to schipol and panorama terrace, terrible windy day and son airspotting taking photos, so popped in for tea (we irish love our tea!) ok..so this big glass of piping hot water arrives! no handle,.no cup,.very hot! and expensive 3.60euro, ok its airport prices, and more of a cultural misunderstanding perhaps??.. of how tea should be served? but the taste was quite refreshing and quite nice taste, but do watch you dont burn your hands or drop the glass! staff were wondering what my issue was when nicely trying to explain it should be served in a cup. then had to ask for milk. the staff are friendly. had nice coffee here later,.and good selection of food on offer. nice and clean as well."
"the food was a little overpriced and the staff need training in basic things like how to smile and treat customers with care - its a shame because we might forget what we had to eat, but we will never forget any bad service or lack of it "
"stopped for a quick bite at the b terminal in the small hms kiosk. the kiosk (despite it being 0800) was picked over and they were sold out of a lot. of the last three sandwich varities, they had a smoked salmon sandwich. though the gentlemen at the kiosk hadnt tried the salmon sandwich, i purchased it (5,45 euros). i peeled it open and oh my gosh it was delicious! i checked the package to see what else was inside my smoked salmon sandiwch and it had a layer of egg salad and capers. if you are at the stand in terminal b, grab a smoked salmon sandwich!"
"i was in latvia for work last month. the airport is not that big and i had no trouble getting through it when i first arrived or when i was leaving. i did not that there where not too many places to eat or drink. there are some, just not a lot. the staff was friendly and the airport its self was clean."
"kebaya offers asian food, although the name kebaya suggests indonesian (the kebaya refers to the indonesian dress women wear) its more japanese/chinese style. food is ordered via the ipad which works surprisingly efficient, maybe a little impersonal. anyway, on both occasions that ive visited kebaya i enjoyed good and fresh sushi/sashimi. it really beats the regular burger or sandwich usually served at airports."
"kebaya is one of the hms host restaurants in schipol airport, this one is an oriental restaurant and i visited twice in the space of a couple of weeks (outward and return journey). both times i had the shoyu ramen which was very tasty and a good sized porti "
good baguette sandwiches for under 7 euros and other choices that tend to be healthy. plenty of seating with area kept in good order. above average for budget eating in an airport.
"while at the airport, we had lunch at hms.  the prices were reasonable.  the salmon on baguette sandwich was delicious.  the coffee was very good too."
perfect service - very helpful and working fast. the espresso tastet perfect and so did the sandwich too. flaguette chs/ham!
"this place proclaims it is promoting pure flavor and setting the path for the future of fast food. foods are reasonably price. we ordered a falafel (roasted sweet potato) rice box and two charbroiled chicken and pork rice box. great taste, delicious. the lemonade drink was refreshing, a great thirst quencher. fast service, friendly staff. "
"nice environment and good sushi. the price/quality ratio is not exciting, but being inside the airport acceptable. very good service and nice waiters"
had a hour to kill and had not eaten breakfast. had a tuna melt panini which was quite good along with a cappuccino which was great. e6 for the sandwich and e4 for each coffee so typical airport prices but at least the food was good
"quick and easy coffee bar waiting for your airplane to arrive. coffee and a fruit juice for under a tenner, brilliant.."
"if you are worried about being safe, i guess anything could happen but they certainly take a lot of precautions; there were at least 7 checks.  compelling architecture and artwork throughout the airport.  lot of places go eat and great shopping."
the place is nice and modern; clean and have excellent pastries and coffee! they also have fresh sandwiches and fruits. i had the greatest cappuccino ever!  good service also!
"schiphol is a great airport in many ways. the 4 hours free wifi, comfy halls to rest from flight to flight, very friendly crew, fast and efficient passport control, safe, clean, beautiful and so many shops to take a look and good spots to eat. sadly, i found that now theres a mc. donalds in one restaurant area, but well, nobody is perfect. "
we ate here before catching our flight home. the fish and chips was under 7 euros and freshly cooked. they do splendid cakes and the wine was cheap by airport standards.
"if you have time before going through to departures then this is a great place to stop. good range of food and cooked well, the chicken satay is really good. best place to eat if you dont want a sandwich in the airport."
nice food and service for a reasonable price.  plenty of seating including an area you can charge your phone/computer and/or work while you eat.
"cant stop talking about the kibbeling & fries for 8.50 euros.  perfect fish and chips, just what the heart wants before boarding another flight.  nice staff, clean kitchen and service area. hey, its dutch."
had eaten a lot during the day and didnt feel like much other than a dinner snack. decided to try this place and were pleasantly surprised. we had one ham on a rather delicious roll and one with 2 generous slices of cheese for a mere euros 9.40 .. inside the airport. plenty of room to sit or you can take it out. ask how to find this place at the info booth if you cant see it right away (its inside).
hms is on the lower floor and is easy to find. nothing spectacular on offer but the good plain food is reasonably priced. seating is fine and the wifi is free.
spent a very happy hour here en route back to the uk. what a haven before your flig 
"we tried chicken pizza, sandwich and soft t "
"i was looking for some breakfast, and got quick service!  my egg and ham sandwich was tasty and filling.  the service was very friendly and in english, although im sure they speak dutch as well as other languages."
"this cafe coco was our best experience at amsterdam airport while having a long layover there. good service and absolutely artistically made salads and sandwiches! they were a piece of real culinary arts. and very delicious! if i remember the name of a guy who made them, it was daniel. i wish i know more places like that around my house in la. if one day im back there, cafe coco would be my first place to go."
"we arrived en spec for a late evening flight and quickly found a free table  the service is slow and the menu limited , but given the few restaurants to choose from we were pleased to have stopped here  the food was delicious"
a really lovely positive team that can‚Äôt do enough for you. the food is delicious and prepared with love and flare.   you may wait a minute longer‚Ä¶but good things come to those who wait.  i‚Äôll be back.
"given the wait line and occupancy of the restaurant, we expected good food was the emphasis. we were not disappointed with my wife ordering the hot goat cheese salad and me ordering the salmon sandwich with tempura crips. the sandwich was the best i have had with precise layers salmon, cream cheese, and crust-removed bread drizzled with a light mustard sauce in a presentation that made eating with the eyes before devouring with gi track. just excellent savory."
"i never mind a long layover in amsterdam. the airport is lovely and clean and made even better by cafe coco. i abhor being served coffee in paper cups; cafe coco uses beautiful cups and saucers. they‚Äôre pastries not only look enticing, they‚Äôre actually delicious. the high-backed chairs are lovely as well. treat yourself during your next layover and check this place out!"
"good for all day breakfast, excellent selection with additional bubbles if that‚Äôs y fancy. service not the quickest  but it‚Äôs much quieter than most places in airport,"
"we waited for a while at the entrance, no staff acknowledged us. staff too busy drying cutlery and faffing about behind the counter. tables were empty and littered with cups et "
"i never write reviews, but this is truly the exception to my rule. we had a couple of hours before our flight departed out of amsterdam and were looking for somewhere to eat. cafe coco, looked cute and the menu looked very appealing for ‚Äúairport‚Äù food. so, we tried to find a seat. it was very busy, and we were warned that it may take a while to get our order. however, with time on our hands we decided to stay. we found a seat at the counter and we were able to watch the food being prepared by a very talented chef. what an experience!!!! dilman was a true pleasure to watch. he is truly an artist with his preparations and the food was truly amazing!!! i wish i could have tried everything that we saw him prepare. he is an absolute pleasure to talk to and even though he was incredibly busy, he found a few moments here and there to converse with us and based on our conversations provided some pairings that were better than many top tier restaurants we have visited world wide. the staff were very pleasant and so polite even though they were completely snowed under. dilman, thank you for making our final moments in amsterdam so pleasant and memorable. we will definitely be back and hope to experience your hospitality again. blessings to you and all the staff at cafe coco."
weve been dining here for years now during our travels. the food is very beautiful in presentation and superbly executed. what creates a problem at this restaurant is the naming of it as a cafe. the limited staff and number of seats poses a challenge for those looking for a fine (airport) dining experience (and willing to pay for the privilege) because most travelers decide to come here for just a cup of coffee or hot chocolate and spend a lot of their time waiting for their flight. of course this is an important option in any airport but when other guests would like to spend their time and money on a wonderful full course meal (breakfast or lunch) it becomes an unpleasant destination. perhaps it would be a better choice to maintain a section as an actual restaurant for dining (and not just one person in a group of 4-6 ordering a croissant...thats not dining) and another section as a specific cafe destination for those who want to save their money and remain sipping their one coffee and surfing the web for the duration of their wait time for their transit.
"visited here on one of our transfers through schiphol, service from all staff was very good, as always service with a smile, keep it up, we will call in on our next visit to schiphol airport."
"this was a fantastic breakfast to kick off our trip. the baked eggs were excellent. even better was a seat at the bar to watch them being made, over and over again. i would definitely recommend this for a coffee and breakfast ( not to mention the bonus chocolate!)"
this would be a treat for breakfast anywhere even at a 5 star hotel. thank you for a pleasant moment on a long travel day.
.... which says it all really. more comfortable and less rushed than the other cafes - a little oasis of peace and style. try the truffle and parmesan oeufs - truly delicious!
having coffee here after long haul flight. good coffee and deserts in the middle of busy airport. feel refreshed!
"during connections, at international airports, is very frequent on get too much time waiti "
"a chocolate and champagne bar that‚Äôs a cut above most of what is on offer in schiphol. an all day breakfast of eggs salmon and spinach was good value at ‚Ç¨12.  service was good, tea came with a fancy chocolate."
"pricey like any good airport food, but the salmon and rice was amazing.  photo does not do it justice. clean and open atmosphere with private seating if that‚Äôs preferred."
so glad we didn‚Äôt go for a coffee in starbucks. table service in an airport is rare but the staff here were wonderful. excellent coffee - we had two and a trio of sandwiches served with edible flowers and a honey dressing.
"lovely coffee and desserts.     excellent surroundings and service, and it was actually cheaper than some of the chain junk outlets.  i will definitely be back.    excellent ."
"a good lunch - cesar salad with a fine chocolate mouse and a caf√© cr√®me, in a wonderful and comfortable place at schipol airport! one si bemol - the staff a little more careful! but this may be because there was a lot of people for lunch."
"ok its not particularly cheap, but i must say that i enjoyed the food and the environment. also the location is good for flights from d gates. maybe it was a quiet afternoon at schiphol (?) but caf√© coco made a nice change from the normal hustle and bustle"
absolutely love it! warm environment! great customer service! unique presentation! amazing flavors! i always want to come back!
thought should have breakfast before my connection and this place delivered. food is delicious and quick. wait staff were helpful and friendly. price is ok as well. you should try it.
"fabulous coffee and nice chocolate on the side is ,for us, the number 1  at the airport. always a worthwhile stopping off spot.and one place  we look forward to during our regular stop over at the airport. pricy admittingly but do go here ."
i always stop here for a meal before boarding to return to the  
schiphol airport can be a maddening place. it‚Äôs huge and connecting from an overnight us flight makes for a very rough morning in schiphol. peace and quiet in a bust place like schiphol is a blessing ‚Äì and here it i 
"i had a couple of hours in schiphol so i was able to stop and grab some great hot chocolate here as well as great chocolate to take home for friends and family. i also picked up a little for myself. it is beyond amazing and while it is a little on the pricey side, it is totally worth it!!!!! the staff is very friendly."
i rarely review airport restaurants...but cafe coco is an exception. while i would not venture here for the food alone and i am not even sure if you could...if you happen to be in the airport it is a lovely spot. the service is excellent the food very good...with an eye for excellence and beauty. while i have certainly had better breakfasts...there are few i have enjoyed in as much in an airport.
"caf√© coco is our favorite place for respite after the frantic check-in process at schiphol. we always have a cup of their brilliant hot chocolate to accompany some other menu item. most recently we had their oeuf en cocotte with ham. delicious! also, their chinaware is beautiful."
"cafe coco is half chocolate store, half exclusive champagne bar and patisserie. very good coffee and a small selection of great cakes.  set out of the way so can be a bit quieter.  not cheap by quality is good."
"friendly service, good wiev, delicious good, nice seats. what can you wait more while spending your time at the airpo "
"not only does this place have the only real coffee behind customs, the coffee is of good quality and staff know how to operate their machi "
having tried a different cafe who had ran out of tea (!) and all but 2 types of cake we came across cafe coco and the experience couldn‚Äôt have been differe 
"after ten hours in airports, canceled flights and a terrible night, i passed by the starbucks and went into the beckoning cafe cocoa (a young man promised the best coffee in amsterdam), to the right of the escalator in the klm huge mall to the terminal on my international flight. it was restorative. like a different world. the expresso, divine, the cocoa served in fine pink and gold china, the salmon and croissant, both the freshest ive had in ten years! very attentive waitress. a free praline chocolate and a book on vermeer and rembrandt to peruse on a marble table helped me regain my equilibrium. as a single senior woman traveling, thanks, cafe cocoa!"
"this is an upmarket cafe located in the departure area at schiphol airport. it has a pleasant seating area with views of the aircraft. there is tableservice and all the staff are very polite and professional. the wine list is very good. also on the menu are teas, coffee and everything from a light snack to a full mea "
"slow inattentive service.  no toilets anywhere near. problematic.  crunchy salmon with risotto was excellent.  salad so so  priced like upscale restaurant, ambience was more like a side walk cafe  b-"
due to a flight delay i found myself with 4 hours to wait in schipol airport. i needed to eat something good and this was just the ticket. tucked behind lounge 2 cafe coco is a hidden gem. good views across the gate d apron and spacious seating. i had the crispy salmon and risotto which was delicious. then coffee and chocolate. a highly recommended way to waste time in an airport.
a nice and fancy location on airport schiphol. friendly and helpfull staff. good drinks and great chocolats.
perfect service and very nice people. fast services. have a good connection with gate departure. thanks .
"we went to caf√© coco for diner. the restaurant is in a quiet corner of schiphol airport and is quite spaciously set. we had a very kind and efficient waitress which was very pleasant. i had the salmon steak with crust while my husband took the steak. both were incredibly delicious!! still salivating when i think of the food. what a way to start your holiday!! a small warning: prices are quite high, but the quality of the food is up there."
"it looked like a champagne and chocolate bar, but we could order cupachino and hot chocolate. delighted it was served in vilroy and bosch china. the seating and view was great."
"nice food, desserts and service . steak and solmon has small portions for a man but taste was good . coffee and chocolates are good too. nice to sit in retro design chairs ."
friendly staff who help you as soon as you sit. love their interior styl 
some friends of of ours always eat here when in holland so brought us for lunch. i‚Äôm sure most won‚Äôt look past the ‚Ç¨33 set lunch but break it down and i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd spend nearly as much upstairs at starbucks drinking awful coffee and eating nasty pre packed sandwiche 
we ended up in here almost by default as the catering facilities at the airport are limite 
a lovely spot to relax while waiting for your flight. we were made very welcome. a good selection of snacks and drinks are on offer in elegant surroundings.
this was our 2nd stop at cafe coco in schipol. espresso drinks are served steaming hot and flavorful in real porcelain cups with a wonderfully tasty praline on the side--exactly what is needed sometimes when youre traveling to gain a sense of cal 
my friends and i enjoyed a champagne toast with chocolate and croissants. we had a long layover and this quiet corner was a perfect place for us to relax before our flights home. food was excellent as was the service! lovely and sunny and bright! i will stop in again!
sophisticated quiet corner of the airport. excellent coffee and spectacular chocolate deserts. very pleasant with attentive service.
"found a new place to frequent at schiphol. if you are looking for something with a little more quality with your airport experience and have an hour plus to spare try this place. very small selection, 4 mains reasonably sized and what appears to be a modern high tea available amongst other things like starters and desserts. i had the ravioli, nice and fresh, served in a very pretty dish with gold detail. service is a bit too relaxed for a place that knows everyone has somewhere to be but all in all a nice experience! "
"a great little find is cafe coco a great place to unwind before a flight in a 5 star environment. beautifully created chocolate, afternoon teas and desserts to savour. i had english breakfast tea served with decorated china tea cups and with real tea leaves. i succumbed to a light creamy and mango dessert that was heavenly. highly recommend "
loved the dishes all served on china and crystal! loved the quiet area tucked beside windows away from bustling lines of people rushing to their respective destinations. loved the great service & the great food!! it was definitely worth paying a little more for this relaxing esperience! 
"after an awful experience at a different schipol cafe this place was a nice find. the service was very slow, the queue for coffee was long and the prices were expensive however this cafe has a nice and cosy seating area to relax in, and the coffee was actually not too bad."
"very nice place , good location in the information airport in amsterdam city  the attention is faster and the worker are friendly  good option for q coffee or sandwich in your connection here"
"i think you can get away with sitting in the cafes comfortable perimeter chairs without ordering. but i went mad and spent 12.70 euros on mango iced tea (lots of fruit and mint) and a coffee (little praline thrown in). food and cakes all looked excellent, but prices to mat "
what a peaceful oasis in the rolling sea that is schiphol. comfy chairs in a quiet area. i had a delicious seafood platter with a delicious fruit iced tea (mango & mint). lots of champagne if thats what you fancy and plenty of delicious desserts or chocolates. the staff are smartly dressed and friendly and polite.
"i purchased some delicious chocolate here last week to bring home from my trip. the women that helped my (name begins with a y) was very friendly and helpful. the price for the chocolate was a little on the high side, but the were delicious."
"with a tag line of chocolates and champagne you may be tempted to pass by, but i checked the menu, and am glad i did. i had neither champagne nor chocolates. after 2 gruelling days chasing around the benelux grabbing fast food when i could it was lovely to be able to sit down in pleasant surroundings, light jazz in the back ground and have a well cooked and prepared filet steak with a glass of red.they did not have the starter i wanted (a tomato tarte tatin with goats cheese) so i had the larger of the steak options -- lablled madame or monsieur ‚Ç¨23.50 or ‚Ç¨31 respectively. with broccoli and parsnip gratin (that i thought was potato-- not a parsnip fan) and a lovely bernaise sauce. good service and quality presentation-- even my tap water came in a cut glass. compared with all the other offerings on this side of the airport it was fantastic."
"cafe coco is one of the few places in schiphol where you can get table service. the coffee is expensive, but good and you get some fine chocolate with it. their yoghurt with granola is good and so are their other food options."
"our fllight had a 2 1/2 hour delay , so we sat there and had a coffee and desse "
"i had the unexpected pleasure of sampling dinner and breakfast (due to flight cancellation). the attraction was the fabulous pralines which are matched to the drinks on the menu for maximum enjoyment. however, the food i also ate was amazing! absolutely incredible - forgot i was in the airport. i had crispy salmon with lime risotto for dinner - and baked eggs for ham and mushrooms for breakfast. just delicious. i also had a glass of champagne with the smallest bubbles - giving a fabulous smooth taste. i cannot think of a better way to pass the time awaiting your flight."
"discovered this place by accident at the beginning of the year, now its my favourite place for a coffee at schiphol airport. great service, loving the crockery too!"
what an absolute treat for a layov 
"if your back is aching and your feet are tired after the miserable ordeal of schiphols security and immigration queues, why not skip the bustle and rush of schiphol airports many quick-serve snack bars, and look for caf√© coco in lounge 2, near the d gates. for an airport, the food was good: i had the encrusted salmon, on a bed of asparagus, and laced with caviar and cress. i savoured every bite. the ma√Ætre dh√¥te was quick to recommend a sancerre by jolivet as a companion wine. he was spot on: it complemented the salmon and caviar beautifull "
"beautifully presented and wonderfully tasty food - a lovely surprise in the hectic rush of the airport - we felt relaxed and able to enjoy the food, and retain our holiday calm."
"relaxed atmosphere, delicious food and desserts, beautiful food presentation and very friendly staff. thank you!"
"we had a tomato tart, quiche, tea and pecan tart before our flight. this was in fact the best meal we had on our trip to amsterdam - beautiful setting and good service - really worth the rather high prices"
"i like the lobster soup! is really good. i ordered steak which is really tasty except the portion a bit small. the cappuccino is heavenly... must try, cones with a piece of handmade chocolate."
"in addition to the deserts i took being delicious, i was surprised to find this level of  presentation and attention to details in an airport cafe.  i sat at the bar, and the service there was excellent.  definitely recommend wholeheartedly."
"the whole layout is a delight and the staff friendly, service with a genuine smile at last. the food is a delight to the eye and does not disappoint, with pricing very reasonable for an airport establishment i would recommend a visit if you are between flights or just waiting for yours. coffee in a very relaxed atmosphere is heaven"
we choose this little bistro at schiphol airport because it looked a bit more cosy than the standard restaurants and food shops. 8/10 the service was fine 8/10 the furniture and decoration fine too 8/ 
generally always disappointed with airport food . lunch was delicious. it may be a bit more than other places but worth it.
my flight was delayed so needed to get something to eat.  was happy with what i had and of coffee was great.
"i looked around schiphol for something other than fast food, i spotted the champagne logo and then the desserts. i had to stop  "
"located in lounge 2, cafe coco looks very attractive with the high-backed chairs and a good atmosphere in the busy airport setting of schiphol. the ambiance and service were gre "
i stopped again on my way through schiphol. service is better this time around. vega super food salad lovely as was montagne de babylon dessert.
"overall a bit over priced. waiters are a bit aloof not the best service in the world. but the coffee was good for buying it in the airport & it came with a little chocolate! i also got a chocolate croissant which wasnt favorable. it was a plain croissant with chocolate sauce dripped on the top of it. i personally prefer when the chocolate is inside. i didnt have a meal, though others food looked good."
"our flight was delayed by 2 hours, so we needed a place to chill out and have dinner. cafe coco was a welcome alternative to all the other restaurants in the vicinity. we had the vegetarian option, mushroom tortellini for ‚Ç¨18. it was delicious and very usual. i also had the tartetatin tomato for ‚Ç¨10.90. "
best flat white and best service accompanied by the best chocolate and absolute best crockery. please please offer it for sale to customers!
"our profound thanks to our waitress alice for her excellent service in the restaurant coco, schiphol airport on 12th of may 2016 kind regards solange and martinus from brazil"
"this is a pleasant spot to wait for your flight. its tucked away from the crowds and overlooks the aprons. food is very good. i had the mushroom tortellini which usually but also rather pleasantly surprised was served with long stem broccoli, butter squash, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. it was wonderful. service was great. the only slight complaint is that despite being table service one has to go to the till to pay. "
excellent espresso with complimentary chocolate. i enjoyed it so much i ordered a second one. its a bit more expensive but quality is good.
"cafe coco is a new addition (?) to dining experience at the airport. the lobster soup is good; tea and sandwiches tasty, porcelain service and table cloth, and attentive service. however, it takes a while to pay, so watch your time."
"restaurant located next to reception area. the menu selection is not big; however, food is delicious."
very nice experien to enjoy some very good dishes. eccellent and friendly service and helped to stretch our weak currency a bit. recommend it definitely!
"i had a caesar salad with prawns and lemongrass soup for a lunch, then a rib eye and fries for a dinner. while i was a bit disappointed with the wine selection the food was superb and the atmosphere relaxing. all the staff was pleasant, polite, and helpful. perhaps a bit more expensive than similar dining experiences but very convenient as a hotel restaurant for a weary traveler. "
"we were staying at the radisson blu for one night and, since we were car-less, we decided to try the hotels restaurant -- and were certainly glad we did. otium has a smart/casual atmosphere with its expanse of windows and its modern decor. the bar staff was amazing (even fixing a drink that they had to look up) and the wait staff was efficient and very friendly. the food was superb and just the right quantity. if we lived closer, we would definitely go back!"
"we were staying at the radisson blu and wanted a quick bite. the area around the radisson is a large mostly tec oriented business park and devoid of restaurants, so it was the otium or the shuttle to the airport. we sat at the bar and ordered from the dinner menu. mostly appetizers and finger food. it was very goo "
we reserved a table by the window and had a pretty view of the grounds. it was our anniversary and the staff treated us like royalty. i had the filet and my husband had the tuna - both were excellent. hightly recommend.

this restaurant is in the radison blu schiphol airport hotel. we were staying at the hotel for the last 2 days of a 29 day european vacation... our 2nd visit to amsterdam during that tim 
"we had requested different food items to the ones mentioned in the menu. the staff were very courteous and adhered to our tastes. the food was customized to our requirements and was delivered fast. we had the best pizza and curry! would highly recommend it,"
"very good service and surprisingly good fare for a restaurant lounge at an airport hotel. its a bit pricey, which you expect, but a good value in a nice atmosphere."
the staff her are always friendly and greet you with a smile the food is presented very tastefully by the chef good selection to choose from a very enjoyable evening that is never rushed
"very good food and you can eat all day ,price is okay a good menu and personal service aftera long day travelling itsa good place to be"
"we were looking for a light meal after a long travel day. at first we thought the menu prices were a bit high. however, after enjoying our meal we thought it was worth it. we had the tuna starter and the caesar salad with prawns. both were fresh and delicious. the tuna was seared perfectly. the caesar salad was large and definitely enough for a main meal. our server (kimberley i think) was perfect. she recommended a chardonnay to accompany our meal and it was very good. we were very pleased with the food and the service."
"breakfast here before heading down town was a great experience. delicious, varied menu, at a fair and reasonable price. you wont be disappointed."
the restaurant is in the radisson  the waiters are nice but service can be a bit slow the food is good and there is a good variety of drinks thomas
burgers in the bar were very good if pricey. not a great choice of bar snacks. table service for drinks and food. staff very good.
"great welcome and very tasty, delicate fo "
the food presented was excellent and so was the taste. drinks were excellent too. the staff were superb and very friendly and efficient. visited here twice during our stay and found it 1st class at both occassions.
"helpful staff and very tasty food. i really enjoyed eating here.the hamburger,club sandwich, and the falafel burger were excellent"
the food was really good nice steak nice it a bit princely but what to expect for a restaurant in a radisson hotel.
superb food and very friendly service. brilliant steak most welcome after 3 hour delay getting from gatwick. puddings were very good indeed. great start to our holiday.
"others have unfavourable review of this place about service so i thought to check it out myself ! i did not find it bad service i think they give you enough time to enjoy the place and relax , the service is not as fast as other restaurant is but we find it quite relaxing after a busy day to enjoy the wine while waiting for our food ! great rustic ambiance , they grow their herbs in their balcony garden , its located in the prime of la besides the new broad museum, 300 ft from the disney concert hall , in front of moca and 500 ft to the dorothy chandler opera house and 2 blocks from the la cathedral!! a great treat for any tourist !! the food is awesomely good , you can try anything and you cant go wrong ! energetic bar , great selection of wines and exciting clientele !!"
"the otium restaurant is situated in the radison hotel about a 10 minute drive from schiphol airport. we looked for a casual business diner at a close distance to the airport and were very pleasantly surprised. a tasty otium salad and perfectly prepared steaks were served most promptly. no hassle, superb service. perfect for a pleasant and efficient business diner."
"had a table for 4, for a dinner with 3 of my colleagues, whilst we stayed in the hotel. i though the prices a little high, but the customer service was excellent. sand choices, steak burger and chicken but my colleague ha date fish and thought it was good."
"we had a very nice dinner. excellent food, nice tasting and the service was very correct. wine was served adjusted at the different course. outstanding restaurant!"
"had a dinner here while staying at the radisson blu hotel. i went for the 3 course option with winepackage. it was very price worthy. the langoustine-mousse as starter was a bit blend in taste, the skrei for main course was so much better. but the flan for dessert is what i remember mo "
"when we first stayed at the radisson blu hotel amsterdam schiphol airport in 2014 for a 2 days board meeting we were astounded by the quality of the food and service provided at otium lounge & restaurant. returning to the radisson blu again in december 2015 we booked lunch at otium. to say it was one of the best meals i have eaten is a bold statement but i can confirm this is true. the new ambience and design of the restaurant is world class. our food was perfectly cooked and the wine advise was excellent to compliment the food. i cant recommend otium enough. all i can say is that if you appreciate extremely good food and wine you have to dine at otium, trust me you will not be disappointed. i look forward to have lunch and/or diner their again when we return to the radisson blu. keep it up!"
"the food was ok and staff was friendly. the starter ceasar salad was good but a bit too much. the ribeye was perfect. the food was not that hot, little bit on the cold side. also the lobster soup."
"my husband had a caesar salad with chicken, pinon nuts, capers,anchovies and was a standard american size serving. i had a blue cheese burger which was cooked exactly as i ordered and the flavor of the angus beef was delicious. the tomato relish was an added accent. the service was cordial and the atmosphere relaxing after a long flight. the prices were moderate and in line with other hotel restaurant pric "
"this restaurant is in the radisson blu hotel at schiphol. the menu presented a decent variety of offerings from snacks to multi course meals. my wife and i shared a salad and then split the burger and a risotto. both offerings were very nicely prepared and presented. we also shared a serving of fries and a bottle of a very decent spanish red wine. there was a definite dutch touch to the food preparation. the server was pleasant, helpful and attentive. the cost was just over 80 euros."
we had a light dinner.  the food is very expensive comparing to the rest of restaurants in amsterdam.
we ate at this restaurant on the day we arrived rather than travel in to amsterdam. the food was very tasty but quite expensive and portions were not large. the menu was quite limited but we only ate here once so that wasnt a problem.
my husband and i went there yesterday for my birthday. impressive food and service!!! such a big surprise:) will definitely go there very soon!
much better than a lot of hotel fodder. the restaurant has an interesting menu with various options. i ate here twice and both times enjoyed everything. service was very good as well.
food was really good with several selection of wine from the list. those who attended our table were fantastic. very attentive!
after a long flight home i came to mc donald‚Äôs drive through located close to schiphol airpor 
"i normally wouldn‚Äôt be hitting the mcdonalds for breakfast, but was in a hurry at the airport and it was great! despite being very busy, they served the food very quickly and everything tasted great! i would have thought i was back in the usa eating at a local mcdonalds! they do have a very nice seating around with plenty of places to plug in your electronics before getting on the plane as well! :)"
"really, i was hungry and tired, i had no idea that in holand there were shrimps in mcdonalds. it was so amazing!!!!!"
"a mcdonald such as you should expect, easy order and pay by selfservice kiosk, fast ready and taste as usualy in the netherlands. we took a quick quarterpounder menu and chicken crisps. typical mcdo service, friendly and efficient."
"rated very good for the overall experience as you can order and pay for your food using the self service kiosk machines. you can customize as you wish. they do have a vegetarian option which actually looks like chicken. it was nice of the staff to confirm to me that it was indeed vegetarian even though it looks like meat. was just average tasting though. if you are looking for a quick reasonably priced meal, this is the place to eat before going on your flight."
"i dont eat much in the mcdonald, but when i go to other countries, i would love to try one, and yes! there are some different taste and quality of food, and that the beauty of traveling around the world to get a variaty of taste."
"we found the food to be good and the prices to be reasonable for airport food.  we live in africa, so we dont get fast food very often."
this is your typical mcdonalds restaurant at schiphol. food is served quick and thats what they should do.
"waiting for a plane home its always good to have a mcdonalds,and this was no exception, hot and lovely and the frites klein were as good as they come"
convenient location close to the ibis hotel and a bus station with direct link to the city center. also good to do some spotting as it overlooks a big part of the airport.
we stopped  in for a late night snack and to my surprise the food was fabulous!!! we americans love our burgers but dam  knows how to  make a  burger! fresh and fabulous!!!
it seems like it was very popular among tourists at the time we were waiting for our flight. we dont eat at this restaurant in the us except for smoothies and lattes but didnt mind at all to grab a bite. plus that portion of the airport was under construction and didnt look very inviting and accommodation :(.
my order was served very quickly but after waiting a while to actually being served by the staff who seems to be stood around doing not alot!
i cannot remember the last time i had a mcdonalds but it must be many many years ago - over 10 at lea 
mcdonalds is always good for  quick & cheap bite. so we needed eating up here.  the food & cleanliness was good
"schiphol is huge and when rushing from gate to gate, where time is limited, it is great to see the good old mcdonalds sign, and small restaurant. great to grab a snack or coffee as you pass b "
we have been in panda some 10 years ago frequently.when visiting family and friends in the netherlan 
nice modern terrace with comfortable seating and friendly service. they served me a delicious spicy tender chicken sandwich and good coffee.
"whether you use their terrace or use their restaurant, youll enjoy a proper meal from a menu with plenty of choice. we come back every now and then if we want to be sure to have a good meal and a good time accordingly."
the restaurant is located in the center of heerde. the food is very good and tastefully prepared. the atmosphere is cozy and the service is quick and nice. the vegetarian can also eat here very well
"i went for a high tea with my mom and sister, it was vedy well arranged and the bites were very tasty. also the tea was very special, with a carrousel of flavours explaining whats what. i will definitely come back next time."
"always with smile and good service from tim and maikel. this spring they introduced a new menu...very nice and good choices, value for money. great place to go !!"
"nice place e, friendly staff, good simple food!   very good price/quality !   nice cosy atmosphere.a must for a modest budget."
on the outskirts of heemstede with enough parkings spaces in front of restaurant you¬¥ll find this restaurant easy going and good value for money. good service and very good food.
"after a wonderful day at the play ground we walked out and tried the fries right by the entrance. these were the best fries i have had, crispy with skin on and soft from inside. eaten with a dollop of mayonnaise these hot crispy golden potato fingers made me feel guilty with pleasure. wish i had picked up one at the beginning of the day as well."
"a small, un-pretentious italian restaurant in heemstede serving tasty italian food for a very good price. the surroundings are modest but the food is very good. service is very friendly."
"more than passable italian food with a dutch-touch (this is holland so manage your expectations!). pizzas are reasonable (not really what you would get in italy), and the rest of the menu offers a good choice. decent wine choice. very polite servi "
"this is a great restaurant for people who love pizza and pasta.  the pizzas were great, and you just had to finish all of it.  i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
"this was a great restaurant near where we stayed.  there was very friendly service and great food.  we were seated right next to the pizza oven, and got to watch our pizza get made."
nice and cozy place. on the main street of heemstede. fine ambiance and very good service. ideal place to meet with friends.
"my wife realy enjoys this italian restaurant, it is child friendly and the staff is very helpful. there is also an older italian man which is really focusing on details and customer experience so all with all this is our favorite restaurant near our home!"
"weve been to la via numerous times and have always enjoyed our meal.  homemade, tasty, and at a very reasonable price.  the service is very good and their menu selections are many."
"i was there on business dinner. menu is real great, but without english translation. so some of meals you have to guess as the waitress also didnt speak english. anyway nothing to claim about food, it was fresh, wonderful scallops and real well made ravioli. i think it is right place for family dinner , but fits also for business lunch or dinner. parking is possible on the street free after 6pm."
"i take out every other week and love their pizzas! my wife always takes the parmigiana. when eating in, the pastas (gorgonzola) saltinbocca and salmone diavola are my favorite. limoncello as dessert. :)"
"i have been here a few times over the last 4 years and it hasnt changed much. the menu is authentic, the bruschetta is awesome and so is the melanzane parmiagiana. the pizza and other pasta offerings have also been appreciated by my companions in the past ( i have been here with real italians and they liked i "
went here as we were looking for something different. firstly the ambiaunce of the restaurant is excellent with a mix of internal and external areas. the 5 course taster menu was excellent with an a la carte on some australian dishes. will be back in large numbers! the only thing that would make it better is ink gin on the menu!
"the most beautiful food and restaurant we‚Äôve been to recently. start to finish it was incredibly fabulous, food is so beautiful and we only wish we weren‚Äôt just visiting so could return! couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough, def worth the trip!"
"had a  fantastic evening catching up with friends  . the  tasting menu paired with some incredible wines was excellent . a wonderful menu , good  impact and good wine . despite the snow ! yes unexpected snow the evening wasa real success"
"bloody brilliant üíû 3rd time ive been here and it seems to only get better. from the delicious food to the excellent wine arrangement. from the hospitable personell to the hard working owner herself, everything is excellent üëå"
"absolutely one of our best dining experiences in the netherlands, the food is delicious and exquisite. we had the 5 course tasting with matching wines. service was impeccable. if you haven‚Äôt been or are thinking of going you should! we will definitely go again."
"we visited the restaurant last night for the first time. the service was excellent, friendly, attentive staff make a world of difference to an evening. the food was delicious, everything was cooked to perfection."
"it is a long time ago we rated a restaurant with 5! stars. but here its earned easily. perfect staff, perfect hospitality, great accompanied wines, perfect dishes, for this lhigh evel of cuisine a very good price rate. beautifull tasty dishes with suprising sometimes mindblowing combinatio "
"wonderful degustation menu. kangaroo, crocodile, a remix of a golden gaytime. super fun evening with lovely wine pairings. good selection of australian beers as well. expensive but worth it for a special occasion. who thought australian food could be so fancy. 10 out of 10 night. "
"on a regular basis we have dinner at southern cross in heemstede, like last saturday with frien "
"great, innovative dishes, with a wonderful selection. other reviewers have noted that it can be noisy and we found that to be true- even with just four of us around the table. service was very friendly but really slow- we didn‚Äôt care because we were catching up- and when we did alert the wait staff that we wanted to leave by a certain time, they hurried up our dessert ord "
"we went there, in this rather noisy restaurant. it has a really atmosphere though noisy. the restaurant is frequenter a lot therefore a reservation is necessary. the servants are professional and aquinted. the menu is australian based though adapter to the european taste."
"you may be wondering why i am writing a review again, as i have written many reviews of southern cross over the years. it is my favourite restaurant in town "
"southern cross is located in heemstede, just outside the city center. this makes it an accessible location for any transport. the interior of this restaurant is modern and trendy designed with comfortable seating "
"the fish is the best thing they have on offer, i would recommend this to anyone who is in the area. even if it‚Äôs for a quick bite to eat."
"we decided to try this restaurant thanks to the positive reviews and we were completely satisfied, the staff was kind and welcoming, the 5-course menu in february was very tasty and creative, and wines were just perfect"
"ive eaten here many times to celebrate birthdays and what not, and every time it is a treat. the menu is very tasty, with some very australian dishes (kangaroo, ostrich or crocodile anyone?), always prepared to a very high standard. the wine selection is amazing. the menu changes often enough to keep this restaurant fresh and innovative. staff is always kind and welcoming. looking forward to our next visit!"
we are very regular visitors of southern cross as it has a consistent high quality and an excellent price / quality rat 
the dishes look beautiful and taste good. price menu e35 and quality is go 
"we are regulars at southern cross, first and foremost because it serves excellent and creative food, and also because it is very close to ho "
"from the moment we entered the restaurant and the owner welcomed us until the end of the evening and we went home, we had an amazing evening. the knowledge of the wines, the enthusiastic stories, the fantastic food and the brilliant attendance of the serving ladies was the best experience ever. do go there!"
"what a great pleasure to visit this restaurant! delicious australian mixed with asian fusion food. choose the 6 course surprise menu and every course is a huge pleasure to taste, see and experience especially with the well chosen wine "
"southern cross always delivers on quality in food and service. if you are into modern australian with oriental influences this is a great place. after several visits we are always pleased to return to the warm and personal welcome of the host, of a level you do not often find in the netherlands. we find the price vs quality well worth it and will return time and again for sure to discover the changes in the menu.."
"we enjoyed a 7-course menu tonight. it was fantastic. from the start with a sparkling shiraz on the terras until thw coffee with sweets. beautiful entourage, super friendly staff and the food and wines are just perfect. we are looking forward to our next visit!"
"we discovered this fantastic restaurant thanks to friends of us who live in heemstede, and we have been here many years over the last 10 years and we love it every single time. fantastic food with great wines in a beautiful setting, and highly recommendable for any aussies who would love a top notch australian food experience whilst abroad. australians will be even happier to know that the menus are priced half (or less than that) of what they would cost at a similar restaurant in sydney or melbourne (35 euro / 50 aud for an amazing three course meal). even though the place is packed every night of the week they havent raised their prices which proves all the more how highly sympathetic the staff are. heemstede is only 15 to 20 minutes by train from central station and from heemstede-aerdenhout station its just a 5 to 10 minute walk. you wont get australian food this good down under, so get it here - but be sure to book ahead!"
its often hard to reserve a table. i often tried but failed. this time i was lucky to book my birthday dinner there with fami 
"this restaurant is one of my favourites since 2002. the cuisine, the service are perfect, never had a mediocre experience, always high level and absolutely consistent, thanks to the focus of the owners and the very very determined staff that make this place so loved!"
"we visited this wonderful establishment last night, and i am still glowing from the memory of the experien "
"on of the few real australian restaurant in the netherlands. owner peter, his wife and the rest of the staff make you feel very welcome. food is out of this world, perhaps from another planet. on warm evenings you can dine outside."
"although acoustics are not great, this is a restaurant to come back to, for the quality of the food, the excellent service and the nice atmosphe "
"when you tell someone they should visit a restaurant because its good, people assume youre talking about a pleasant place with decent food for good pricing. this restaurant deserves more than the label good: its absolutely outstanding. the food is extraordinary, the flavors are a thrilling experience for your tastebuds. they have various fish and meat options and one vegetarian option, each with totally different taste panels. some dishes are spicy and make you think of the asian influences in the australian area, other dishes are typical australian. the service is also on point: friendly without being clingy."
"this restaurant combines flair and excellence in all it does. its difficult choosing from a menu that includes kangaroo, emu, crocodile and also guinea fowl. all the meats are very tender, flavorful and have touches of unexpected flavors and textures, the mark of a creative kitchen. the welcome is warm, like friends who havent seen each other for a while but pick up where they left. the waiting staff knows how to pair australian wines with the dishes. leave it to them."
the staff are attentive with excellent suggestions. the wine list is quite extensive and the food delicious.   highly recommended
"a great experience all round. good food, no pr stunts, good service and general feeling of being welcome. recommended for a good evening out with friends or family. you cannot go wrong, whether a meat eater or a veggie!"
"first time trying australian dishes and i do not regret. great experience! service top! wine pairing excellent! hope to visit you soon again, guys!"
"nice and cosy, easy going service, perfect food, perfect service.  food is excellent on the flamboyant side, just like its chef ;-) go!"
outstanding service and a warm welcome when we came back again. southern cross has constant quality changing a menu to choose from and once again we were very happy. our hostess natasja is such a warm personality that the outstanding dinner can hardly be beaten. natasja also selected the wines accompanying our dinner and this what you should do. she knows so well to choose the right wine for the dish. in short...go and experience yourself !!
"amazing food and wines and fantastic service. a great place for small and bigger anniversaries, the southern cross has been offering the same outstanding quality for years now."
"for mothers day we had dinner here. it was our first time. some of the dishes are a little complicated but always well thought out and tasty. great wines too and excellent service. no worries if you dontt want to eat kangaroo or alligator, there is beef too. delicious cr√®me brulee."
"allways fully booked but when i reserved a place on a warm summerday they had held two tables, one outside and one inside, apart for me and my friends. so we could choose. the service and the food on that day and other days was excellent. rarelly been served better elsewhere!"
"i always make sure we visit this great gem of a restaurant. its a great looking place that has a easy going vibe, a superb menu and the best staff. the owners are welcoming couple that always make you feel like home. this place holds a special place in my heart and our vacation is not complete with at least a few appetizers in this place. the prices are more then reasonable especially considering all the food served here is of the highest quality/flavor/presentatio "
"living in the uk myself but fortunately haveing family living nearby this is our/my favorite place to visit for a wonder dining experience. from the very exciting taste combination to the high quality of ingredients, the ambiance and the very attentive staff, all details are covered and you will leave with a great smile on your face. my dietary issues are dealt with a smile and great ease. so the only problem will be what new excuse you can think off to book a return visit : ) thank you natasha, peter and all the staff x"
i started wi 
been there with friends - big family - 2 adults and 3 kid 
good australian food reasonanable price. it is a nice place to have dinner with friends and family not too far from our home.
"during our 5 days stay in amsterdam, we ate out for most of our meals, including some pretty high end restaurants in the city proper. little did we know that our universally favourite place would be this australian restaurant! being adventurous, we tried the crocodile, ostrich, and kangaroo among other things, and most of us ordered the 3-course meal. we were not disappointed - the food was incredible, prepared with care and every bite was a dre "
"we found this little pearl on friday to learn there are no free tables. managed to get a booking for a next day though and it was worth it! 3-courses menu give you a curious choice of dishes you would never have a chance to try anywhere else. we went for a crocodile, an ostrich and some fish, finished by cr√®me br√ªl√©e and a chocolate cake. ostrich was a highlight of the evening, a fine meat, better than any beef i have ever eaten. cozy interior, great for family meetings, dates and parties. lovely and friendly service as well. we will surely get back if we get a chance! well recommended! not a surprise it has such good reviews!"
"what a lovely restaurant! we went there for my grandmother-in-laws birthday and the experience was brilliant! a nice selections of diverse meats all cooked to perfection with great tastes! the service was also very good, polite and friendly! great experience will go again!"
"this is a wonderful restaurant. the service is impeccable and personal. the items on the menu are unique, creative and fabulous. i almost hesitate to give such a positive review as i dont want crowds to find out about it!"
very nice atmosphere.  nice staf and real aussie food make sure you have a reservation specially during friday saturday
"eat kangaroo, ostrich and the ever changing deserts! this is a must go to restaurant. great food great service. house wine very acceptable. the ‚Ç¨35 dinner is very good value. book in advance for weekends!"
"fusion so new exiting combinations of food with a perfect presentation nice wine and good service, give it a try"
a very good australian restaurant. the wines are very tastefull and the people are great. make sure you have a reservation and you will have a great evening.
"3 course dinner, amazing tastes and choices, really exceptional !! the atmosphere in this place is so awesome, the personnel so friendly and attention full. the kitchen produces each and overtime high quality food...go there and try for yourself !! recommended !"
just great! attention to detail is very high and this australian cuisine is very well met by the great australina wines they are able to serve! really a great night out in a lovely atmosphere. certainly when you go for the menu du chef tasting menu with wine package. however also the 3 course menu has some superb specialtys like the venison. just love to go there!
"the variety of dishes is excellent, and some of them you wont find inn the area. always busy, good sign for fresh food. have been there twice now and for sure will go again. one of he best places in heemstede and perhaps haarlem"
"great australian food, well presented and prepared, friendly staff and cool atmosphere. what can i say more..."
"constant quality, wonderful food and great service. our favorite for years already. great valse for money!"
"kangaroo, crocodile or tropical fish. southern cross always has very  good australian food. exotic, but tasteful. staff is friendly and helpful. ample space and good seats."
"southern cross in certain ways is hidden from tourists, it is located in a little city 30min from amstetdam. it is very typical and has very good food. i was amazed with the menu, literally. there was everything- duck, crocodile, kanguru, crab - between many others. other comment about the food is that not only has a big variety but it is very well prepared- maybe bigger portions could be advisable. for a starter,main course and dessert the price is ‚Ç¨33 which is a high price based on other restaurants in the region. to conclude, i strongly recommend the best australian restaurant in holland. "
"every time we visit is great food, nice people excellent wine and a very good price go there and enjoy"
"it was not the first time that we had a wonderful meal here. the food keeps a constant high quality and the menu is always surprising. we had steak tartare and chicken liver parfait for starters and as main course rack of lamb and the vegetarian goat cheese dish, all very good. of course we finished with a great desert a chocolate mouse plate and pavlova with lemongrass ice cream. friendly staff and a good atmosphere, you can sit in the garden or inside. highly recommended! "
"great food, unique food and a great experience. one of my favorite restaurants. its possible to eat all kinds of different authentic australian animals and it taste great. only complaint that it is a bit noisy. but that is mainly because it so popular"
"we went there based on the good critics on tripadvisor, and were quite lucky to get a table for two on the saturday evening, as the restaurant was packed. we wrote an e-mail in the morning, they called back and proposed us a table, very efficient and nice. we decided to try a 5 course surprise menu. the first course was good (scallops with pesto and parmesan), but not extraordinary, but after that it got better with every course. the cod, the lamb and then the kangaroo were really good, the lamb being probably the best lamb dish we ever had. we would not have chosen it from the menu, but we definitely would have missed something there. the surprise course has a very decent price for the quality served, but the wine card is quite expensive, but you get some good wines. service was impeccable and the atmosphere is good. unfortunately it will be difficult to be back, as were not living close by."
"a little taste of australia in heemstede! we went with a group of friends and we all had the tasting menu... absolutely delicious! food & wine were great, service fantastic and the place itself had excellent atmosphere. have recommended to several friends and we will most definitely come here again! "
"great restaurant with an indoor garden, great food an wines and normal prices. in the weekend you must make an reservation otherwise you have to wait at the bar for a table."
"great value for money,  very friendly service. the menu is unexpected and suits all tastes. the crocodile bitterballen are to die for...and the wines too. make sure you book in advance."
"that is what the title of this review is. and southern cross definitely went beyond my expectations. i was with a friend whos from ozzieland herself and she was surprised. all the food is imported from australia and the chef gave a dutch twist to the bitterballen with crocodile in it, and the kangaroo was also delicious to the fullest, and my ozzie friend thought the angus steak she had was also perfect. perfect wine, ambiance, food and prices too! (70‚Ç¨ for two pax, one 3-course menu and a starter and maincourse "
"we had a great evening here together. we filled the online from for a reservation, where i said we had not been there for a long time, since we do not live around and more. but we were in town and would love to come to diner while and grandma and grandpa would babysit our son. there was actualy no room left, be this is such a great place with two tables at the entrance / bar where you van normaly not eat. he aside us whether we wanted to start there, and go to another table later. great! we would love to. super service! we went for the surprise menu and had 6 super delicious courses with very diverse food. so tasty, kind people and allahs worth it to go back here!"
"great food, great service, great staff. we devoured our meals, then (half) joked about the small portions. 10 minutes later...2 extra main courses, served with a smile! but dont just take my word for it. go and find out for yourselves."
"weve had dinner at southern cross several times a year, since it has opened its doors in 2002. chef peter and his wife natasja run a perfect place. youre welcomed as soon as you enter. atmosphere breathes australia, staff is experienced, friendly and knows how guests want to be treated. it is fine-dining at his best. the menu has a choice of fish, meat and vegetarian. anyone will find something he likes. bread/butter and table water are complimentary, just the way it should be. i must say ‚Ç¨ 33,50 for a three course dinner is a bargain by any means for a restaurant in the west of the netherlands. presentation and taste of the food is on a michelin-star-level. keep up your good work! well be back."
"we have now been to this restaurant a third time and we are simply amazed at the consistency with the customer experience we received. the food continues to delight albeit we missed some of the the dishes in the previous menu. the service was warm, friendly and prompt as usual. it is proving to be a hard act to follow by other restaurants we have been to - several of which have had the same good reviews. but nothing beats consistency - and this is where its thumbs up for southern cross for us. "
"we walked in on a monday night while the restaurant was nearly full. luckily there was 1 table left for us. the staf is well mannered, experienced and has knowledge. we waited for some time before the menu and drinks were served. the menu exists of some 8 starters, 8 mains and 8 desserts. we had crocodile and melon as starters. we had lobster and steak as main course with a superb red wine from longhorn creek."
"we were hooked from the moment the starters arrived. beautifully presented, created with care and completely delicious. main course had a tough act to follow but did not disappoin "
"a colleague recommended the restaurant to us and given it was close enough to where we live, we decided to give it a go. we made a booking on the day itself and was lucky to get a table. we were running late as our grocery home delivery arrived later than expected. we called the restaurant to apologize and they told us not to worry about being late, and i our table would be ready for us. we got to the restaurant and were immediately served and made to feel very welcome. we ordered the 3-course meal and were treated to a truly marvelous dining experience. the pork loin and steak dishes are to die for. this has clearly become one of our favorite restaurants. "
"this restaurant is a favorite of ours. the menu changes frequently, but always indicates original australian cuisine. there is a good guidance to choose the appropriate wine. the service is excellent and very friendly."
real fine dining. peter has an excellent creative mind. and everything tastes wonderful!!! and natasha is a great hostess. best restaurant in heemstede
"southern cross is a badly kept secret. for those of us who have discovered southern cross but still have to book well ahead of a table, their success is our loss ! the restaurant is located on the main road from heemstede to zandvoort. in the summer you can eat outside when warm enou "
"social business dinner, including wife and son of one of our colleagues that had earlier lived in melbourne.  great menu -- interesting choices including crocodile and kangaroo for those that want to try something different from half a world away."
"fantastic menu with australian and european dishes, well-prepared, beautifully served. many interesting appetizers, creative desserts, strong main courses. price-value is very good.  wine selection is excellent. tru the wine arrangement. on a saturday night completely full. located in a quiet neigborhood near haarlem."
each and every time we went for dinner at southern-cross we had a choice out wonderful dish 
good food with sometimes the australian touch and fair prices. sometimes a bit noisy when there are groups around. nice wine list.
"challenging mix of foods combined to wonderful courses in which the diverse cuisine of australia can be tasted. attentive and well trained staff. dutch style house with typical australian elements and aboriginal art. personal touch by owners. definately worth a visit even more visits, even when you have never been in australia before. "
you can be sure that everything that you will order going to be a perfect match on the plate. moreover wines are excellent and the prices are correct. from the guesting till serving everything is well organised. everybody was helpful and friendly.
"a fine restaurant, going strong for the last 5 or 6 years. we have been here several times with australian friends and relatives. both the dutch and the australians enjoyed the food and the friendly service."
"very tasty food and good atmosphere. the menu is not very large but it includes very special dishes like crocodile, cangaroo,  but also very nice traditional plates, like an excellent rack of lamb. the house wine was perfect too. very friendly and attent service"
"i came across this restaurant in a bizarre way as i was sent a voucher by qantas airways after a bad flight; but i am very glad they did it. this is an exceptional restaurant in the netherlands, and the only one where the canadian who accompanied me ever commended it on its service in over two years in the count "
"we have been visiting southern cross frequently for the past 10 years and were never disappointed. the food is adventurous, tasty and prepared with great care. plan your visit well in advance as there always seems to be a rush to the restaurant. once youve been there you will understand why! cheers to natasja, peter and staff...keep up the great standard!"
once again we went to southern-cross and again it was very a very enjoyable experience. we choose the set menu offering six choices per cour 
"i ate here with some ducth friends who loved the place. i had some reservations about an australian fusion restaurant in the netherlands. however these were unfounded. it sources good quality ingredients ( which is a theme that i see in other good dutch restaurants), and the quality of presentation is top class. i enjoyed the meal from start to finish and really enjoyed the wine that we had with it. pity i cant remember the brand "
"as we associated australian food with kangaroo and crocodile, we had not been here before. we heard that they also served excellent fish dishes, so we tried it o "
"try southern cross in heemstede, the netherlan "
"while the modern australian cuisine is receiving a lot of (positive) attention lately, there seems to be some confusion about what australian cuisine really is. and even after having dined on several occasions, i am still looking for differences between the modern australian cuisine of southern cross with other fusion cuisines. typical australian ingredients like crocodile, barramundi fish and kangaroo are used for some dishes but other dishes are mixtures between european, chinese and indian food, which is nothing new. perhaps, that is what australian is, an amalgam of various culture "
"this is a restaurant that cannot be beaten for great food beautifully presented by extremely well trained, delightful staff price,quality it is excellent. the wines are well chosen and to be honest there are no down sides to this restaurant. it is so popular with the locals that you would be wise to reserve a table well in advance, even up to 2 weeks at peak periods! during the week you maybe able to get a seat on the spur of the moment. "
"as you can read in the other reviews aswell this is a great restaurant. friendly service, different menu (kangaroo, crocodile, emu, etc. and a very good relation between price and quality (35 euro will get u 3 courses). australian wine, australian beer. don¬¥t forget to try the pavlova dessert accompanied by the 20 year old museum dessert wine."
"good menu. starter - main - sweets one price, great. you have to reserve a long time in advance as it is allways full. no wonder great value, service and wine chart. its worth the wait mate!"
"while walking down a street in heemstede, close to the main dutch airport, i saw the southern cross... while living in africa, the crois du sud gives me a total different idea, but i was curious and went in. it was a restaurant and we got a table outside in a pleasant gard "
"i have been quite often now in this restaurant and everytime again i am pleasantly surprised.....the food quality and variation is excellent, the price is very very friendly, the staff the best i know in this region! friendliness, knowledge and professionalism are key words. the owners peter and natasja work in the kitchen resp the restaurant and you really feel among friends!"
australian cuisine is not something you see around haarlem and heemstede. what can i sa 
i was surprised when one of my local colleagues recommended southern cross. id never been to an australian restaurant though ive been to australia a couple times. the food was great. had my first skate wing and tried a colleagues kangaroo and both were superb. who would think to look for australian food when visiting the netherlands? now i would. highly recommended.
"for only you 32,50 euro you can choose from a three-course menu of australian cook/owner peter. his dutch wife and her staff give your good information about the wines, and excellent service in general. menu withvery nice fusion choices and many good suprises. but one warning: try to book in advance because even during the week this favourite spot in the haarlem region often full-booked."
staff was super friendly. we were there with a bunch of kids and they immediately came over with pencils and paper. our order came fast and the pancakes were yummy!
"been here many times, our favorite pancake place.  we had the homemade asparagus soup which was lovely and very tasty. of course we had pancakes, and one of use had the sate with chips. all very nice.  yet another great visit, and well be back."
this is a family restaurant serving a wide variety of delicious pancakes. the restaurant was reasonably empty during our visit. service was quick & efficient and the food tasty. it is well worth a visit for people who want to indulge in good pancakes.
"impressive list of pancakes that appealed to all members of our family, but if pancakes aren‚Äôt your thing there‚Äôs other options such as salads, burgers and hashes. we sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere on a sunday evening- lots of local families with small children. pancakes themselves were huge and tasty. "
this is a lovely neighborhood restaurant that i try to visit each time i am in heemstede. it is warm and friendly with good food and service. this was my first visit in summer and the outdoor seating was perfect!
"have visited many times, the food is always excellent with a wide range there is something for everyone on the menu.  easy roadside parking.  the pancakes are large and filling.  would definitely recommend a visit."
"sunny weather, so we could sit outside on the couches, enjoying our beers after a hike in the kennermer waterleiding duinen area. busy place, good for pancakes. little childrens playing area, enjoyable little stay"
after a long walk in the woods it is a niceplace to eat pancakes a great assortiment  offcourse different dishes
"we have been here for dinner after visiting keukenhof. the savoury pancakes we had were good and the tiramis√π i had for dessert was fine. the price was honest, though not exceptionally low."
one of the best pancake restaurants ive ever bee. you name it theyll make a pancake of it. across the road from groenendaal forrest.
"my family and i with inlaws and aunt went here for pancakes at lunch time and really impressed. good portions, fresh made and scrumptious food. one can see why its been around so long - def worth a visit"
"on a sunday afternoon  it was very busy   nearly full service friendly ,in a few minutes perfect pancakes with a smile"
"been there 3 times this year, and prefer the pancakes from this restaurant above t panneland and de oase which are also close  "
nice shadowed places to sit  good pancakes and tiramisu parking no problem nice walking area oppposit
"the pancakes were delicious, and we were seated with a great view of the flower parade that, coincidentally, was happening at the time that we were eating."
"the pancakes were great here.  we did need to wait about 20 minutes before we got a table, but it was worth it to watch the flower parade!"
the pancakes at de konijnenberg were delicious.  the kids enjoyed the pancakes that they ordered.  i would definitely recommend a visit to this restaurant.  we also went during the keukenhof flower parade.  we could see all of the flowers through the restaurant window.
"really enjoy the food, nice menu... our kids enjoyed the evening too. very good service and very affordable prices. stop and eat something at this place"
"i have eaten here many times. it is a good place to visit after a walk through the groenendaal domain just accross the street. we usually had pancakes (it is a pancake-restaurant after all), but also try the sat√©, which is also very good. the restaurant is decorated with reproductions of old duch paintings. a great place for birthday parties with the kids. dogs are allowed in."
"this typically dutch restaurant, just across a beautiful walking-forest, you find this gem. known to every one in the surrounded area and... from much further away. i love this place. very friendly staff, nice visitors + (dogs !) and great, very great pancakes. try it.....!"
the best pancakes of the neighbourhood of haarlem. all sorts are possible. specially with children a good environment with on the other side of the road a park to walk.
a sunday afternoon favorite for dutch pancakes after a nice walk in the adjoining forest.  other options are available.  friendly staff and quick service.
"this is a so-called pancake house which is a common phenomenon in the netherlands, serving many variations of the dead-simple pancake primarily aimed at kids as all kids love pancakes. but the restaurant serves other typical dutch dishes t "
this restaurant was a real surprise to  
our dutch friends took us to this chinese retaurant because it is their favorite. it is now our favorite too! we were given a table overlooking the rear garden which was very pleasant. the food that came blew us away. the food was beautifully presented and was delicious and there was alot of it. the chef will also recommend sauces to go with the various dishes. i would go back here anytime.
"first time visiting and dining here.  the staff were very welcoming and friendly.  enjoyed a wonderful meal, it was excellent and would certainly go again!"
"delicious meal,l had the fried dumplings and mandarin duck,husband had soup and a beef dish which all were outstanding,husband said best chinese meal he has ever had!!"
"the food stands out. the service is impeccable, in the center of heemstede. and last but not least.. take away !! (believe me, you have to wait in line)."
"came here on the first night of our trip on the recommendation of our airbnb owners and we were not disappointed!! food was great. we had the sharing dishes (cant remember the name of them, sorry!) but im sure if you ask they will be able to tell you. everything tasted amazing and was very filling too. staff were also super friendly and helpf "
"this restaurant has, for years on end been able to invariably deliver the authentic indonesian rijsttafel experience. i can always smell it coming in. great !"
"the quality of the indonesian food is profound, very taste full and well proportioned. it is always a treat to eat at sari, i have got fiends you come from the south of the netherlands and must eat at saris"
"ive had the small rice table and ive felt bliss at every bite.  closing my eyes i really felt back in indonesia.  will definitely be back, best indonesian restaurant so far."
"the real idonisian cuisine like we dutch prefere this.  choice of spice , normal spicy , very spicy. do not hesitate to ask for spicy or very spicy. your mooth and lips will  tintle the friendly staff wil explain this perfectly."
"looking for a great place to have authentic indonesian rijsttafel? look no further! the dishes here are absolutely superb and tasty, and there are many side dishes to choose from to supplement your main course. the most difficult thing here is to choose what to eat!"
we had take-out from sari a number of times now. food is good quality in general. really liked the freshness of the gado gado vegetables which often is a mush covered in sate sauce.   great to have as your local indonesian around the corner.
"every time i visit the netherlands, a visit to this restaurant is included.  the food is excellent and the quality always remains the best."
we had a small rijstafel and extra sat√©. all the different cooked portions of beef and of vegatebels were of a different taste and were just like it is cooked or grilled in the original kitchen of indonesia. it is recommended to reserve in the restaurant.
"for years sari is named one of the top indonesian restaurants in the michelin guide. its been at least 5 years i enjoyed the famous indonesian rice table at sari and been telling my friends to go there. last saturday it was d-day for sari. i took six of my friends to the restaurant and we all know what indonesian food should taste like. it was more then delicious, we took a rice table for six and was more the enough. four different sate dishes and 4 different rendang, just tasted as how it should. the restaurant it self is still comfy and small. although they could renew the interior a bit. another thing i was a bit disappointed about was the missing of the traditional staff, the cute indonesian waitresses. though the dutch waitress was very cute too in her traditional batik dress. though like to see indonesian faces in an indonesian restaurant. maybe they had a day off haha. i really recommend sari as one of the best indonesian kitchens available in the netherland "
"great indonesian food,  authentic and well established.  in a small space but very cosy.  rice table is their specialty and they know how to do it.  service extremely friendly."
"a great place to order and take out indonesian dinner as we call it rijsttafel. this is one of my dads favorite meals. and at times we go for take out 3x per week. very good service, large quantity of food. great price"
"excellent quality, nice staff, really great choice, in one word...... jummy!!!! had dinner with grandchildren and they loved it."
both the food from takeout and restaurant are of great quality. this is and will probably always be my favorite indonesian restaurant. take away tip: nasi goreng rames speciaal

"the food is fantastic.  this restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  i had a wonderful brunch at the restaurant.  the staff is friendly and professional."
"a creative and playful set of courses (you can choose from 5, 6 or 7) presented in a cozy 8 table, tastefully decorated setting. cautions: they do not accept credit or debit cards! also, for international (non-dutch) travelers, they do not speak english. total cost for a dinner for two (6 courses) with one glass of wine - 80 euros."
"you were so enjoyable today! tender, juicy, cooked to perfection. accompanied by tasty mash, vegetables wrapped in bacon and a salad, you were exactly what i wanted to bite into. and your price was right. thank you (and the cook of course)."
"nice restaurant in the heart of assen. very friendly staff, good food, relatively good prices (for the netherlands)."
"i come to holland to visit my partner, every time i do come here i come to noyas it‚Äôs good and the price is well worth what you spend, it‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt deliver to smilde."
"im writing this review while dining because i just have to get it off my chest. this restaurant is  great, the owner is an amazing host and the food is absolutely delicious. good flavours, great menu, good beers."
"in a view words: perfect! the tastes are so good, every bite is an sensation. happy nice owner who took the jump to start in coronatime. he knows what food en drinks are about!  a must go!"
"exactly what we missed in assen, a good tex-mex restaurant! great food, lovely place and friendly service! love the tacos! you gotta try the churros as dessert!  just dreamy! ü§óüç¥"
came here to eat on an extremely busy night. the night before assen tt. service was excellent. lots of waitresses. food came within a reasonable time considering how busy it was. it was well worth the wait. i had a rib eye steak. it was beautiful. would definitely eat here again. would recommend a visit. famous for ribs 
witterbrug has the best food in town. the people are very nice and friendly. we love this place. sparerips and sate are my favorite. best food for a normal price.
"we ate here saturday night. it feels like a typical english pub inside, very cosy. the two men in the group ordered ribs (sweet ones on a recommendation from our server) and they declared them the best ribs they have ever eaten. the two women in the group ordered steak which was perfectly cooked and tasty. the only slight disappointment was the dessert of dame blanche which was served in a glass dish rather than the normal flat plate and didnt have enough chocolate sauce! but other than that the evening was perfect and the young lady serving us was lovely! "
"we go every year when in assen for the world superbikes. some of the best food i have eaten and the people that work there are excellent. good beer, good service and good food all round. thank you for looking after us when we visit."
"we found this restaurant just off the centre of assen a few years ago and visit at least once every time we are in the city. great atmosphere and service, good choice of food (menu available in english) 2 minute walk along the canal in to assen and reasonable pr "
"the best indian restaurant ive been. excellent taste!!!!! when order in you get chips, union-saus and chips extra."
when we go out we mostly choose indian restaurants. we visited new delhi in assen for the first time and it was an excellent experience with tasty food and generous portions.
"we enjoyed a meal at new delhi on may 10. the friendly host/waiter made us feel very welcome. we ordered some favorites and were surprised by the size of the portions. the food was fantastic, fresh and served with a smile, though we couldn‚Äôt eat all of it. the prices were lower than we expected also. we would dfinitely recommend this restaurant."
"it is a nice, family restaurant. nicely decorated and with a good atmosphere. very cosy. the restaurant offers a big menu, a lot of choises! great tasting food for a resonable price. a perfect place for an evening out or take away."
ate here on the eve of assen motogp so not unsurprisingly were the menus targeted at set rather than a la carte which were reasonably expensive.  tasty dishes however and prompt service unlike another restaurant we walked out of.
"really nice indian restaurant. staff were very helpful and polite. food was excellent, tasty and warm."
"went there with a few friends. the chicken vindaloo tasted like heaven. the peswari nan was ok. very friendly staff member asked if the dish wasnt to spicy which, for me, was right on the spot. will definitely come again."
"small place with a typical atmosphere. very friendly staff, but best of all, great indian food. and for a decent price! much better than most indian restaurants which adept roo much to local taste."
very nice restaurant! very good quality of food and decent service. very recommended for a nice indian meal!
"delicious indian food. small restaurant, very good service. the restaurant is located near the drents museum and the brink in assen, the oldest piece of this town."
"been to this place many times over the past couple of years and love it. food is great, service is friendly and the price is right. having compared this place to british indian restaurants i feel it is very similar and can definitely compete with the best indian food ive had in the uk. they do take away as well."
this is a very very good adress for indian food.  the staff is helpfull and the food is so good......check it out
"hubby and i have been going to this restaurant since 2008. since weve lived in india (new delhi) for four years before, we were in search for authentic indian food when we arrived in assen. this restaurant did not disappoint! we love the food and the owner is a really great guy who loves to chat each time he sees his regular patron "
"nice indian restaurant in pleasant location in assen, opposite the italian ice cream restaurant (probably the bet dessert option ;-). the food at new dehli is straight indian food as you know it from british indian restaurants, good quality, very reasonable prices. love their garlic nan but also the chicken tandoori is very good. recommended."
"the restaurant serves high quality food and drinks. the staff is friendly and professional. if you one is not interested in a full meal, one can always order snacks and drinks. the restaurant terrace is also a wonderful place to sit and enjoy a meal and drinks. "
good accommodation and friendly staff. good food in restaurant; only problem is having to park some distance away from hotel.
"staff first class. rooms very comfortable, large and very quiet. the room we were in seemed to be a newly refurbished"
myself and a group of friends stopped here to eat as they have a very nice terrace where you can sit and watch the world go by. as it was motogp weekend the restaurant was very busy but the service was very good and the staff were friendly. food was reasonably priced and very good. we did end up visiting again before the weekend ended.
"nice hotel in centre of assen. clean, bright and the staff are friendly. food before 9 am can be an issue as all the local establishments does not open till 9am"
"we chose this hotel restaurant as our first in the netherlands because we wanted to use a credit card and it is one of the few in the town that accepts them. it is located on a busy square in the town center and is a wonderful place to pass as much time as you please enjoying the passing parade of bicyclists and pedestrians on their daily errands. no cars are allowed in the center of this charming town. there are many outdoor tables with umbrellas as well as a glassed-in area at the front of the establishment. because it was a chilly october day we chose to sit inside under a roof section of skylights, surrounded by windows looking out onto the square. it is quiet and the wait staff is excellent. on our first visit we ordered from the less expensive lunch men "
a very busy lunchroom in the middle of assen they serve typical lunch time food sandwiches and soups service was good as the place is very large and busy has a nice heated terrace!!
"service is nice, there¬¥s a lot of place to sit (in- and outside) and the food tasted nice (i had a hawaii bread)"
"great coffee, amazing apple cake, homemade tasty crunchy and fresh, great choice of teas, gift packages"
nice little coffee and chocolate shop with great tasting treats. the interior decoration gives the place a warm and  welcoming atmosphere. would revisit!
the terrace we sat on was cosy. i had a brownie and ice tea and it tasted good. the service was well. nothing to complain.
"i absolutely loved it so much here, i had a hot chocolate which was amazing, there was the choice of milk, dark and white chocolate. it had such a nice atmosphere and there was a huge range of teas and coffee. i also had a cup of tea because i didnt want to leave !! i ventured upstairs and found a more isolated area that would be great also, i am in assen for another month and i am sure that i will be spending a lot more time at coffee & tasty. "
"great coffee, nice ambiance and good terrace in spring/summer. friendly staff and a good selection of coffee and tea (also to purchase for use at home)"
they have very good coffee beans from different places. you can choose one to have an espresso and buy some to take home. very nice place!
"the coffee & tasty in assen is a combined coffee and lunch cafe, with a shop to buy premium coffee and tea. they have seating downstairs in the shop but many visitors venture upstairs where you can sit more privately. they also have outdoor seating in summer. the decor in the shop is a nice mix of modern and classic. prices are quite reasonable with many lunch dishes around 6 eur "
we had a great meal to take away from the balkan restaurant. fresh meat from the grill and luxurious portions. it could use a bit more vegetables though.
"friendly staff members and generous portions of food. we had the seckani biftek	and the balkan plat. the meat was cooked well, very tasty. good place for meat lovers."
"for me, who likes balkan cuisine this place became a unexpected finding! they cook almost the same dishes as you can find in me beloved croatia"
"we went to celebrate a birthday, and ordered the sabel dish. tons of meat, all very well prepared. side dishes were nice and fresh. great experience. we will certainly go back here."
"small chinese restaurant with really kind and perfect service. very tasty and good prices.  ordered a litle starter and a really great one for only 6.90 euro. main menu:  unbeliveable great taste, great portion. great great great. absolutely to be recommended."
visited happy gardens last weekend with 5 friends. we had a lovely meal and the staff were excellent. bit of the beaten track. if youre staying at dr binge weber hotel its only 10 minutes walk.
"i ate here on a quiet thursday night in march. the restaurant had only one other family dining but that didnt impact on us at all. the service we received from our young waitress was fantastic and the food is definitely the best chinese ive eaten in assen and probably the whole of holland. chinese in holland is different to what we have in the uk (generally a lot better in the uk) but we managed to order dishes that were tasty, fresh and full of flavour. my mum said the pancake roll (loempia) was the best shed ever eaten and the spicy sweet and sour chicken was delicious. i definitely will be returning. "
we went here for a meal when at the superbikes. the restaurant was empty when we got to it at 8.30 pm. the young waitress couldnt speak english and our dutch was nil. however we were offered and banquet of different dishes to which we accepted. it was all very nice and tasty. pudding i bit poor in choice. drinks as usual price 
"good service, great food, and decor that turns chinese restaurant decor on its head. make a beeline for this place, you wont regret it."
"little price, wonderful foods, very nice people ! dont hesitate !! by french people came for assen tt"
never been to this restaurant before and we arrived when the heavens had opened and we had to dash to stay dry.  service is a little slow but the menu appealed to us.  not pretentious but good food.  we will certainly be back here.
visited here with husband and 2 children while staying in ass 
had a pancake here of an evening. boat is quaint and large. staff friendly and service was quick. pancake with mushrooms onion and bacon was delicious - the beacon was very tasty and lots of it. only down side - no tap water only bottled which is charged for.
amazing place with a great ambiance. very nice that your eating in an actual ship what is completely rebuild in to a restaurant. we were very impressed with how the ship looked like and the location. the quality of the pancakes are as far as our experience goes above standard made from biological and quality ingredients. this place has an child friendly environment because from the moment you enter until you leave the wait staff is taking excellent care of the children. really a place to recommend when you visit assen or even word too take a little detour before you go somewhere else.
very good food. very nice people who serve you. you order wine and without asking you also get a glas of water! for children its perfect there! everyone is helpfull !
really good atmosphere in the boat. the staff is nice and the choice is great. i took a banana pancake with cinnamon and sugar. its a really thick pancake and worth the money. enjoyable for lunch or dinner.
it is a good place with great range of pancakes. we try both salty and sweet one. nothing can beat its apple cinnamon pancake.
"the restaurant caf√© is located in the centre of diever next to the ancient church, at the brink (center of the village). we had bife tartare, smokes forel pat√© and mustard soup as first dishes. very tasteful and large portions. as a main dish we have chosen drents weide rund prime steak (2) and ratatouille with brie cheese. all dishes were tasteful, the staff very friendly and nice good cold draft weizenbeer. all in all a remarkable location and wonderful food. highly recommendable"
the food and the drinks tasted fanatastic! very nice staff helped us and provided information regarding the menu. really a beautifull view over the fields next to the restaurant.
"visited the restaurant for the christmas dinner special. the grazing table was absolutely terrific with a bounty of finnish bites, the pickled herring was to die for. from the warm atmosphere to the polite and multi lingual staff, one of the best places to spend an evening enjoying some fine high cuisine."
"vegan food at nordic restaurant. this unique combination is possible here. the food was tasty and well seasoned.  situated near forest reserve, lovely place and interior"
wonderful food and atmosphere!! we will surely be back!  it really seems that all the staff are really taking care of the customers!
"we were here during lockdown at a time where we were only allowed to have dinner in our room. dinner was truly wonderful, surprising combinations, lovingly prepared and served with great attention to hospitality. the owners are very friendly and understand how to pamper their guests. and i fell in love with their dog ;-)"
"few mistakes were made during our surprise dinner here, and we enjoyed each meal and accompanying wine. the staff is very friendly and eager to please, and the chef has created some original and very tasty dishes. if we had to critique something, it would be that one of us had salmon as first √°nd main course: a different fish would have been more interesting but then again, both dishes were fantastic. this is fine dining and not cheap, but worth it if you want to spend on a special evening and good food and wines."
"we, our whole 2+2 family, had a pleasure to visit blauwhemel right after new year eve hassle and just before they went for winter break. it is difficult to describe the feeling when you don‚Äôt expect much, but receive a whole l "
"me and my girlfriend came here on a saturday evening, we were instantly made to feel welcome with great service and great smiles from all the staff. we waited no longer than 10 minutes for our table to be ready which gave use a nice amount of time to enjoy one of there cocktails that were also very enjoyab "
"great welcome with warm hands and lots of enthusiasm! great atmosphere and good for for family of business. good music in the background and spacious table setting and delicious and well balanced dishes. experience enthusiastic service, ambiance and excellent food! enjoy!!"
"great place for a lunch after a biking tour. fresh and tasty sandwiches, nice and attentive owners and beautiful view. inside area looks fantastic as well. worth a visit"
"about 16.00 hrs we landed on the terrace in the center of beautiful diever, a place where quite some traffic is passing but meanwhile a cosy place to be 4/5. there were some more people, the terrace was almost occupied. we ordered a tea, hot chocolate with cream, mushroom soup and apple pie with cream 4/5. the service was friendly and the waiting time short, about 6 minutes 5/5. refreshed we continued our journey 4/5."
we were very friendly helped by our waitress to find a table in a very busy restaurant. the choice of beer and wine was very good and the service was excellent. always somebody available to take your order and it was delivered very quickly. the only negative was the naco‚Äôs which were burnt but our waitress sorted it out. the other food we saw serverd was well receiv 
"very good atmosphere. lots of different beers to choose from. highly preferred by the locals. terrasse, conservatory, and cafe/restaurant. good food at reasonable prices. once experienced, you understand why it is so popular."
enjoyed mustard soup which included buns on the side. also some iced cappuccinos on the side. price was very reasonable.
"centrally located among great shopping and parks with a large patio. i recommend the brasserie salad with goat cheese...i went back the next day for a second time just to have it!! the service is a bit slow, but they do have a english menu. the wait staff do their best to speak english for you as well. i absolutely loved sitting outside and watching the people and bikes pass by. "
"if youre in the neighbourhood of emmen, go here for your evening mea "
"good food, nice atmosphere. most notable was the staff: friendly, fast, knowledgeable. we also found the restaurant family friendly and having good vegetarian options available (same quality as the meat dishes). some reviews here mention the big portions, we found them large as well but not impossibly big. the fact you get good quality food in decently size prorations scored points with us. in short: worth a visit if you are staying in the area!"
"cosy amenity, steak done right, side dishes could be better. overall a good choice and we had a lovely dinner."
friendly service and reasonable pricing. i‚Äôve ordered the salted caramel brownie which was decent and an espresso.
"well, the headline says it all, doesnt it. this is a place that you just have to visit a few times to really see how original and good the food is. not only is it very tasteful, but the presentation and mix of flavors is always of a very high standard. it is hard to keep that level of quality in your restaurant over and over again. to come up with new and exiting ideas about your dish of the month ( this month its a pulled pork sandwich to die for ! ) everything is fresh, service very good and welcoming. and you can see that they are all very proud of their restauran "
this is a fantastic restaurant - which ticks all the boxes - great service; amazing food; great ambience. i have eaten many curries in my life but none beat the indian food i‚Äôve eaten here. i highly recommend this restaurant.
"we eat here nearly every week, or do take out during covid lockdowns. the interior is outdated and in desperate need of modernization, and the service can be slow. but... the food makes it all worth it. real authentic food, with intense flavours. fave dishes are the shabi kurma and chicken madras. the owners are incredibly kind, and another reason we keep coming ba "
"this is a real indian restaurant (i guess bangladeshi), not the usual indo-china establishment you mostly find in the netherlands. food is excellent with a large choice on the menu. forget the wines as none worthy is available but indian beer is available."
if you like indian food this is the only place in emmen to go. the food is good but nothing special. the service is ok as well.
"great food, super friendly, humble, young staff. good atmosphere, good prices, will visit again soon."
"we were pleasantly surprised with this indian restaurant. after all, emmen is not too exotic a town. for those not tamiliar with the indian sub-continent kitchen, the menu states clearly what to expect: mild, hot and very hot. we liked it so much that we went back twice in quick succession. on both occasions, we were not disappointed. they cook authentically here as one would expect in a bangladeshi run establishment. for those who like alcohol with their meal, there is a good selection, including kingfisher beer brewed in indi "
for a modest price you can enjoy a delicious diner here. the menu gives you lots of choice. decoration is basic and the service is ok.
"for me and my girlfriend it was the first time at an indian restaurant. the atmosphere is cosy and the staff is nice. because of our first experience, it had been hard for us to decide which dish to take. we decided for chicken meal matched with rice and bread; i was satisfied and full! at the end i can say that the restaurant is also relatively cheap."
we gave this indian restaurant a chance to prove itsel 
the currys are great and the staf friendly. we enjoyed the nanbread fresh made out of the oven. the lam tasted very smooth. enjoy!! o yes for the dutch people good  prices!
"please.. watch your fingers, as the food is just beautifu "
"wow! what a lovely restaurant, we realised this was a great place to eat when we walked through the door and it was full of local people. interior of restaurant was lovely and the staff were absolutely fantastic . food was amazing and plenty of it. not the cheapest but happy to pay a little extra for quality and lovely surroundings,would certainly visit again if in that area again"
"coming from denmark, we amed to eat here, as we had good memories from years a "
"just as simple as that. best chinesse food in emmen. i recomend the cantonesse menu for 2, we couldnt finish it and was really tasty."
"i live in china for more than 3 years already,... so i clearly did not go to this restaurant for the chinese food. i feel the chinese food is not authentic. however i do really like the indonesian food. take away is fast and the portions are gigantic! if in emmen,... this is a good place to eat! the pick-up is closed for lunch,... that is a pitty!"
"had a takeaway meal last month for my staff. as with all chinese foods you always get more then you can eat, and the taste of most of the dishes were grea "
"friendly restaurant, good food and a great place to eat with friends. nice surroundings with no complaints from us at all .... except the awful background music! mind you, when we mentioned this to the waiter, it did make him laugh. menu in dutch (of course), but waiter very kindly helped us choose our food as our dutch is limited to hello and bye bye! will definitely go back again for more good food in the future. well worth a visit if you are in the area."
"altough it was the high season bussy and very warm, the food was tasty and service excelent. the outside sitting area is also a nice place to sit."
we enjoyed our lunch with a group of 10 in the restaurant part of t knooppunt. service was fairly quick and the food was prepared under our eyes in the open kitchen. coffee and tea as well as the lunch dishes were of good quality and also good value for money. the airy restaurant room was attractively decorated and properly heated as well. the only remark could be that we were not asked if we wanted drinks with the lunch dish 
"we were going to lelystad haven and on the way we always eat something at this d√©lifrance. the waiters are friendly. the food is good, sometimes a little bit much but thats ok√©."
"tasty food, good choice. good value for money. high chairs for kids. hope there will be more vegetarian options in future."
"our family of 3 adults and 2 kids had lunch at la place restaurant when we visited batavia stad fashion outlet on 23rd april 2019. there is adequate parking. the restaurant had a large dining area. there was a wide choice of meals - soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, stir-fry meals, juices, tea/coffee as well as desserts on a self-service basis. the meals were healthy and wholesome. although the meals cost an average of about 18 euros per person, all of us had a satisfying meal."
"we were pleasantly surprised to find a la place in the factory outlets of batavia stad. they are upstairs, next to a small playground and queue-free entrance to bataviawerf (with its replica voc sail ship "
ideal restaurant for a quick lunch in between shopping good selections of hot and cold food and drinks!!
la place offers a good lunch with sizeable portions of fairly healthy components. did not see any deep fried stuff. it is a large place on the second floor of the outlet mall above a number of shops. good views over the mall and the very impressive replica batavia ship outdoor in the harbour. better be early like 11:45 because it gets busy.
"when i had time to relax after quite a bit of shopping, i decided to come to this place and glad that i did.. iÃá had one of the best pizzas ever and the prices are very reasonable too.. they have all kinds of foods here, great place.."
"so we were hungry went up the stairs to see what la place is all about perfect, self service, fresh food great food eatery we had a sandwich, apple pie and a beer (or two)"
"very pleasant, open, flooded with light coming through the large windows. in this way the march√© like restaurant offers fresh food, including smoothies, salads and fresh soups. although it remains a self-service model, its a good choice."
we enjoyed a very delicious indian dinner. the host is extremely attentive and very kind. the food was very tasty and we loved our evening. very recommandable and reasonable prices.
visited here with friends. we had a lovely mix of starters to be shared among us and then main courses for each of us. everything tasted good and we definitely had enough to eat. naan with garlic was great choic 
"fantastic restaurant, good food and good ambiance, friendly staff. pls try jhinga tandoori, in my view one of the best. truly indian cuisine."
1st time we visited this restaurant in lelystad. it certainly was a pleasant experien 
nice place to dine. good and tasty indian food. easy to reach and a very clean place. pleasant background indian music. lots of choices in the menu. clean toilet. fast and friendley service.
"great local indian restaurant. friendly and attentive service, very tasty dishes. i hope that town residents support this very well run gem. highly recommended."
"highly recommended ! as first time customers we ordered two main dishes (chicken tikka and garlic chicken kebab), with average expectations. the food was very well prepared and fresh. it was not overdone as well. there was not too much focus on spices or gravy, just spot on. the portion sizes are fine, but due to the taste my wife and i had difficulties to keep away from taking more than needed! the extra that came with the food, aloo mutter, was surprisingly well prepared and would qualify for a full main dish. this gave me the incentive to add this 5th star to this wonderful establishment. keep up the good work!"
"we went there, knowing that in the netherlands food is generally a little toned down. had the dinner for two with spinach, lamb, tandoori mixed, basmati rice and lovely milkrice dessert. very nice and prompt service. food was delicious! we sat outside in the shade. totally enjoyed it and will go again."
"very welcoming, especially as we know, no dutch.  we both had a coffee. the restaurants customers all see to be enjoying themselves in a hushed kind of way."
the menu was clear and contained all the items applicable for lunch. the food was excellent. the service was very friendly and efficient. the atmosphere was pleasant. the decoration was cosy.
"harrels is in my top-3 of favorite places to go to when im in lelystad, because the ambiance is very cosy and the choice of foods and drinks is excellent. they do have flevosap, which is organic apple juice, and other organic foods."
excellent choice to dine to close down the busy workingweek. every friday night a special dish of the day. it comes with french fries and always a very tastfull mixed salad dish. the staff is very hospitable and pays well attention to all guests.
always happy with the food at de cantine and the staff is friendly and makes you feel at home. for me this is my number 1 restaurant in lelystad.
second time weve been here. first time was about a year a 
"we live in france, a country which prides itself on its cuisine, a claim weve found to be - at best - overblown. certainly it is possible to eat extremely well there, but only at a cost. in the netherlands by contrast we found the restaurants to be generally superior in many respects, and this restaurant is a fine example. the service is fast, the staff attentive, and friendly. the food is beautifully cooked (the steaks are spectacular), clearly the ingredients are sourced and selected with care and attention. the location and ambiance lovely, and the final bill much less eye-watering than its french equivalent would be. whats not to like? we love it and go there every visit"
well actually rebuilt from the 1950‚Äôs original (that had to be demolished in 2008) and brought up to date to comply with modern building and health and safety regulations. the original frames have been reused and ‚Äì based on the original drawings - the new building is as close to the original as possible. we walked in without reservation and there was no difficulty even for a saturday night. the food was typical dutch cuisine and very enjoyable. we did not go mad for drinks or starters but enjoyed good quality main courses. my wife sampled the slip tongue (sole) and i choose the spare ribs. certainly recommended and we may well visit again because this was good value food well served and very much enjoyed.
"pulled in for a break and light lunch on my own. this is what i guess we would consider a motorway service station, but it doesnt really feel like it. restaurant is pleasant and comfortable, staff very friendly and helpful (english seemed to be understood and at least one of the staff was fluent). menu provided with all options in engli "
we have stopped here several times as part of our trip through holland it‚Äôs really nice place with very good menu and food. i would really recommend the soups staff are lovely as well.  paul
love the dutch weed burger here. best vegan burger there is. good place for a break and have a lunch or drink.
a really nice restaurant. a.very peaceful and classy look. the red velvet cake was really amazing. the staff is friendly and helpful. a nice place to stop for a break.
this is a comfortable place to stop on the way. the staff is very friendly and the food tasty. you wont notice you are right by the highway.
"the second time we stopped by for quick lunch. tortilla chicken with cheese was pretty good, simple, warm and delicious."
they have take away and also restaurant. food was healthy and good size portions. also cater for children with a good choice.
"for decades already this is my favorite place to stop over, on my way to the northern part of the country, coming from the more urban southwest of the netherlands. you know that you will always get a nice meal here, with friendly staff and good service. try the chicken sateh, a classic..."
stop over restaurant en route giethoorn... good place to buy a hot chocolate or a coffee and to use the rest rooms next door. polite staff. make sure you have a credit card - cash is not accepted.
a very pleasant and unexpected surpri 
this is a nice vegetarian restaurant in the village created by maharishi yogi devote 
"do not expect anything of exceptional and you will be very, very satisfied! after finding that restaurant, i ate there as many times as i could."
weve been living in lelystad for more than 20 years and had never been to yuan befor 
"if youre not a vegetarian, youll be able to experience the deliciousness and beauty of vegetarian foods. you wont have to ask your vegetarian friends if the only thing they eat is vegetables. "
"first off: its called yuan, not yua "
"in lelystad we have a hidden gem, and it is this restaurant. im a local and quite familiar with the restaurants in the neighbourhood, but this one is definitely my favorite. the service is always exceptionally friendly; the owners will always take the time to explain the contents of their menu and advise on a dish. although the service is quick, professional and friendly, the most important thing of course, is the foo "
"we went to lemonakis last week. we had fun! listen to what happened to us. we were a group of four. we arrived at around 7:00 pm. after being seated, we received a welcome drink. that was awesome! we then ordered. fifteen minutes later, the group that had sat right next to our table left. some of these guests hadnt even tried their food. simon told me to take the french fries. i took them. the people at the table behind ours laughed. the fries were good. i went back to the table and took more, i also took another of their dishes. the waitress arrived. she saw that they hadnt eaten much at that table. she apologized for the delay at our table and at the table behind us. she asked if we wanted more of their dinner. we agreed. she also asked to the other table, the one behind us, if they wanted one of the untouched plates. they agreed! we laughed. such an awesome mome "
"i go there regularly with my family for a delicious greek dinner. the food is delicious, typical greek cuisine, big portions, excellent presentation, a complete variety, nice & fast service in a typical greek style decorated place."
"first time placed order at asami sushi. very fast delivery, good price/quality, tasty sushi. will definitely order again."
this place is great. generous portions of excellent fresh sushi. the take away delivery service is friendly and fast. we are regular ordering from here and have not had one bad experience!
we eat here very often. we also order by home delivery. the owner-chef prepares the sushi and the other items fresh after receiving the order. no frozen food and the quality is comparable with any luxury sushi restaurant elsewhere. the delivery is always on time.
"their sushis are nice and fresh. a bit too european style maybe (with mayonnaise,...) but very good anyway. good place to go if you want a take away and have dinner in front of the lake :-)"
"small restaurant where you can eat or order home, fresh and tasty sushi in reasonable price. not in center, but they do home delivery."
"we had a steak and a meatball for lunch. the steak was tender, the meatball was juicy and spicy. we both loved it. the staff is really friendly and attentive."
waiting time: satisfied service: loved it food: stunning (best burger)  overall: it‚Äôs a must-go restaurant. everything was fantastic!
"we visited het broodhuys in leeuwarden recently. the food was good . i ordered a rare steak which arrived more medium than rare, however , it was tender and delicious. the staff were helpful and efficient and i would return."
the restaurant was very busy we ordered and it arrived very quickly. my husband and i both had the burgers they were well cooked and the chips were nicely cooked and crunchy. the burger came with a delicious sauce served separately along with mayonnaise for the chips. this resturant is a smooth running and well organised resturant . pleasant staff and would definatly eat there again.
"my first visit to this place and looking for a small lunch , i love croquettes so the decision was easy , in dutch style with a slice of bread too, lovely service and nowadays so easy to pay just swipe and pay using your credit card , i remember the old days and that is not long ago that credit cards were not accepted anywhere , well thats history "
"very good food, nice breeze, wifi and nice birds. i named one of the birds wayne rooney. over all, very nice place :)"
"stumbled on this while looking for somewhere for breakfast on a cold and deserted sunday morning. most places are closed on a sunday, so we were grateful to see this welcoming and warm place nearby. very cosy interior, fantastic coffee and the best bagels ver. add to this fantastic service and this is the place to go for breakfast."
"had a soy milk latte and vegan bagel, was lovely! sat in the sun and had a wonderful time here. would visit again"
the atmosphere was good and perfect for a late lun 
"friendly staff but you got to be lucky to get a place as it is quite tiny, cosy and always busy. interesting bagel menu, everything delicious and the coffee is just amazing and i am quite picky when it comes to coffee"
"a really good option for having your favorite bagels! the products are fresh and tasty! the service is very friendly and fast! at that day we had life music, so it was a really enjoyable breakfast with a wonderful atmosphere! thumbs  "
think relaxed classical music combined with great coffee and fresh food! the setting is cute and just minutes from the heart of the city and canals. a perfect start to the day.
coffee is great and the girls who work here are very helpful.  one of the best cappuccinos i had on my visit to leeuwarden!
nice relaxed place to eat.  have tried several of their bagels - all delicious. love their mint tea with honey.  coffee is served in delightful unusual cups.  no pressure to leave.
"nicely located on one of leeuwardens canals in the city center, it is lovely to sit both inside or outside on the cale. the inside is quite alternative, but very cosy, and we spent many hours there with friends- either just for a good coffee, a fresh juice or lunch/breakfast with some bagels."
"sooo if you ever see bagels and beans just go inside, sit on a table and just open the menu! its difficult to decide between all these types of bread and the flavors but all of them they are delicious! the prices are a little bit expensive but still its worth it!! take your friends and go there.......!!!"
we stopped into bagels & beans because it looked interesting and we were just trying to find some breakfast. this little place was really excellent for coffee and healthy snacks. we had a bagel treat and a yogurt dish. the food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly and fun.
what a pleasant surprise this cafe ! it is a shame i did discover it only on the last day of my trip . i sure will be back on my next trip to leeuwarden . thanks for everything !!!
"this was the first caf√© i was on when i came to the netherlands. after that i always come back to it. they have excellent food, smoothies are delicious and fresh, and it is possible to get hot chocolate with soy milk (which i appreciate, that is lactose intolerant)."
"we like to have the slow-breakfast deal in the morning, its always a nice treat (and more or less healthy). all the combinations with bagels are delicious, and made with fresh ingredients. we also love the smoothies, but especially the coffee! caff√® delizioso ;)"
everytime we have so much fun at beagels and beans !!! :) ;) the food offered there is great !!! the staff is really polite and easygoing !!!
on my search for the best coffee in leeuwarden - this place has been the best so far. dobbel cappucino :)
"bagels and beans is a dutch bagel-restaurant chain which is famous for its relaxing interior and great bagles. you can choose form a variety of bagles and add your own ingredients if you feel creative. moreover, there is a wide choice of juices which are all delicious. bagels can be eaten at the restaurant itself or ordered to go. a perfect place to meet friends, stop by during a busy shopping day or have lunch when in town. although its based on a fast-food-restaurant concept, you might have to wait a while before youre served your order."
"we stumbled across this place by accident and were absolutely delighted that we found it.  despite the simple interior, the food was freshly cooked and delicious. we were made to feel very welcome. would definitely return if ever back in leeuwarden."
"i was there 3 times and each time was a great experience- the service, home-like atmosphere, and of course the food. as a vegetarian you have a choice between 7-8 delicious dishes. i like the feeling how through ethiopian food you understand the culture a little bit better. as an improvement i would like the drink menu to be wider and contain organic tea/ coffee collection."
just love these special places that make you feel like you‚Äôre in another worl 
this is a no frills ethiopian enclave in the city center of exotic leeuwarden. i had the vegetarian injera but theres also meat on the menu. the owner/cook is a lovely lady. just check it out!
"really friendly staff and great food. we went with teenagers and a 7 year old. we requested the food wasn‚Äôt too spicy and we got exactly what we wanted - very tasty, not too spicy food and lots of variety (we opted for the tasting menu). the service was helpful, talking is through our options and packing up our left overs when we couldn‚Äôt finish it al "
"everything for me was good. the waiting time to receive my order was ok, not short and not long. the delivery male was friendly and has good attitudes. both food and drink were better than i expected. i ordered the ikan pepes medium menu. the white rice portion was perfectly enough for me. but the fish was so big so i left it for my next meal. althought i am a person who eat a lot. and the vegetable also was much but it‚Äôs a good thin "

it makes sense to start with mentioning i lived in indonesia and have a fabulous meal in atambua as a reference. a couple all the way from sumatra went to timor to cook padang foo 
"i visit ondel ondel regularly because the food is always prepared and served perfectly. the service is always very friendly. ive tried indonesian dishes for many times in asia, but the quality at ondel ondel is great. my friend and i recommend you soto ayam. also gado gado and (for those who are keen on spicy food) daging rendang is a recommendation."
"we are new in leeuwarden and like asian food, so we tried this little cosy indonesian restaurant. the staff is very friendly and offered us a table on the firstfloor or on the groundfloor. we chosed the ground floor. we ordered nassi goreng, telor cocos, rendang, spicy beans, daging smoor, chicken sate, fried tofu, spicy chicken etc. the chicken sate was good but the peanut sauce wasnt the authentic indonesian peanut sauce. the taste is authentic but the flavour could be more specific. the dishes were spicy as ususal for many indonesian dishes. we enjoyed our dinner but as said, the flavours could be better. we are a couple, malaysian/dutch with much food experience in the far east."
"wide range of offers, lovely staff. can be a place for lunch, dinner or take away. besides they have interesting snacks worth trying"
"lovely, friendly little place off the high street/shopping area of leeuwarden which we stumbled upon quite by accident. having eaten in some of the best indonesian places in amsterdam and london, this little gem is unpretentious and in my opinion (and my daughter who‚Äôs never eaten indonesian fare before) .. ‚Äòthe best food i‚Äôve ever tasted‚Äô. the beef rendang is fragrant and tender. best of all the food is authentic and honest and has not been altered to suit local taste. generous portions, reasonably priced. we couldn‚Äôt read the menu (was in dutch mostly) so went with what was recommended by staff - which was brilliant! highly recommended!"
we went here on the recommendation of our indonesian friends. they told us that if we wanted realy indonesian food we should visit ondel ondel indonesia in leeuwarden and oh boy did it taste good. the food is exactly like in indonesia and i wouldnt want it any other way.
"amazing food, very friendly staff (owner), we had very good lunch with plenty of food en vegan options, you should try it out"
"we like to mix it up and go looking for something that is not peoples first choice, like this korean restaurant. it was quiet (one gentleman) but the food was excellent. kimbap was really good, japchae with bulgogi also. try the korean beer when you are the "
"good food, spicy and healthy! we enjoyed our korean meal here. less busy than the main tourist areas."
we spent ages trying to find a cheap restaurant that had some gluten-free food. the staff spoke brilliant english and offered to adjust some of the dishes to give us more options. amazing food and incredible staff!
"happened upon this hidden little gem of a restaurant while walking downtown with a friend and decided to give it a try. small card, always a good sign of a restaurant owner knowing her business. great tasting dishes and friendly servide. on the way out, i decided to purchase the home made kimchi which is light, fresh and gingerly!"
"decided to finally try stek with my friends. besides the little embarrassing entry moment (we entered through the glass door instead of the regular one) everything was delightful. very nice stuff provided us with a menu containing quite a few options. i personally has a cappuccino and a muffin (and the muffin was delicious, especially for those with a sweet tooth üòâ) the place is very aesthetically decorated and conveniently located near the city center. all the products seemed fresh als "
"i had a delicious ginger tea, banana bread and fries. the house cat is very friendly and likes to be petted. all in all a nice stay."
i did not expect this place to be such a w 
we passed this restaurant when we were visiting the center of leeuwarden. this place is close to the bridges and the canals somewhat west of the city center. its a busy area with lots of traffic but they still offered some nice seating both inside and outside. when seated inside you can look into the kitchen and its clear that this place is run by a female-only staff. they also are only open from thursday to sunday for dinner. the other days they close at 6 p.m. they also have an open counter on the street side for take away. their menu is not very extravagant but they serve honest food and it is clear than youngsters feel at home here. the wines were not very chilled but that was quickly solved with some complimentary ice cubes and the food was quite ok. the prices are really modest here which adds to the attractiveness for the youth of leeuwarden. but we also felt at home here and this place deserves a higher ranking on the list for this nice city.
"a favourite spot of mine in leeuwarden.   the location is fantastic.  the service attentive, food is ok but the surroundings make up for it and the price reflects it.   perfect for a lazy brunch."
"the all you can eat menu has a variety of appetizers, sashimi, rolls, and rice dishes. there‚Äôs a dessert bar with a variety of ice crea "
"we just had dinner at nihon88. what can i say? excellent, delicious, worth every cent. five rounds to order per person for ‚Ç¨25 each. we were rolling in super sushi, tried soup, ramen, bacon - actually we couldnt eat as much as we could hav "
you choose  between  a lot of small  dishes  with all kind of very delicious courts. very nice staff. we will for sure come back.
"this is one of my favorites in leeuwarden. i am from america but i live here now and one thing i was sure to be giving up was mexican food, but no! yucat√°n is amazing and makes me feel right at home again when i need a mexican food moment. everything is delicious, the staff is always friendly. i‚Äôve never had a bad moment her "
"our bike group descended onto yucatan to celebrate the accomplishment of our frisian 11 cities bike tour - no accidents, no breakdowns, no arguments, et "
"for an uncomplicated, relatively affordable meal yucatan could be a good choice. had the yucatan mix and i loved it. washed down with a few mexican beers i had a ball. uncomplicated and tasty,  recommended"
"after what took my friends and i about 2 hours to choose a prefect place for dinning, we decided on trying out yucatan. little did we know this place would come to blow our minds with their amazing food and beverage... we ordered the rib eye and 4 different sides and of course a nice frozen margarita.. the meat was succulently juicy and the drinks on point. let me not forget to mention the amazingly great service of the kind staff. compliments to the chef and you will be seeing more of me.. "
"ive been here with some friends, the restaurant is located in the city centre, so it is easy to come here. the atmosphere is really nice, the staff is kind and they have also english and german menus and they speak englis "
"it was very busy in this restaurant and as we got seated, i was surprised that it was a big restaurant. service was excellent and our waitress spoke english as was the menu card. we ordered nachos for a starter, lovely and cheesy! then we ordered quesadillas and onion soup which was all very tasty! we finished our meal with lemon cheesecake, vanilla ice cream and what a way to finish off for the evening. my husband left behind his glasses and we were are about 150 metres up the road and our waitress flagged us down to return his glasses. service above and beyond. "
"being from the western usa, i was craving some mexican in a foreign land. very pleasantly surprised to find good mexican in the nl. had several good regional beers, nachos and a burrito. all very very good. staff was friendly, menu was in english and i was very satisfied. its not the same as in the american southwest, but pretty damn good!!"
my wife and i have been coming here for many years and have consistently had edible happiness every time. especially the nachos todos and burrito picada mixta are spectacular.
"we have been to this restaurant multiple times and will keeo going back. the food is delicious. i lived in los angeles and had been missing good mexican food since my move to friesland but yucatan goes above and beyond my expectations every time. the food is delicious, the people are friendly, the restaurant can feel a bit crowded at times but it actually adds to the atmosphere rather than takes it away. my favorite thing to get: their burrito mixta. half chicken half meat burrito, best of both worlds. "
"our group ate twice in the yucatan restaurant during a two-week stay in a leeuwarden. on both occasions, extensive menu with great food, large portions and efficient friendly service. it is a popular place to have dinner, and not being the largest restaurant in leeuwarden, booking is recommended. would definitely eat here again."
big portions for a nice price. the waiters were quick and welcoming and the locale was cozy and family friendly. the have some really nice tequila! would go again.
"very good mexican food, it was very busy, but the service was good just the same. the menu is extensive, and you are sure to find something you like!"
food was good but the service was rather slow.  cuisine is cooked correctly and theres plenty of spices. i would eat here again.
if you ever had real mexican food than this is so so. 
as we were in the neighbourhood and felt like mexican we decided to give this restaurant a try. the staff was friendly although later on the evening it got quite busy and then they stressed out a little (just the body language not how they communicate with customers - that was still well enough 
"i‚Äôve been here on a saturday with my girlfriend. the entrance was quite strange, with a big curtain at the door. personnel were really friendly and made us feel comfortable. the restaurant is not too big, i think it‚Äôs for 30 people or something like that (there were stairs going upstairs, maybe there are more tables "
good deliciuos food and nice people. nice sitedish  very busy with al lot of other customers who also were eating and enjoying.
"lovely food and very friendly staff. would recommend this place to others! in the city center, go and find out!"
"great food, definitely recommend! i went with my boys, 5yo and 8yo, during a 4 day stay in leeuwarden. staff is very friendly, food is good quality. the kids can play in the speelhoek. both nights only about 20 mins waiting time. we will return for sure! "
"i was together with my man an daughter. we have had a very pleasant evening. the food was good but it took a while before we got it. there is a nice little space for younger children to play, very pleasant. the staff was also very hospitable"
"we had a pleasant dinner there a couple of nights ago. the staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. the food was, as expected, tasteful and beautifully plated. the waiting time was the only thing that didnt stand well with me. it is a pretty big restaurant so it makes sense, however, the food took longer than expected to come which was not ideal."
amazing service with friendly staff and amazing desserts. the food was satisfactory and absolutely filling out to the belly!  would come again!
"good food! servants are very kind but a bit slow, a ‚Äúwait & see‚Äù attitude. no problem for us though :)"
"you can‚Äôt make a better choice then going to eetcafe ‚Äúhet leven‚Äù . nice service friendly and fast. the food is excellent. i had a nice steak tartare, not something you eat everywhere but here you can give it a try!! my wife took the fish trio which was outstanding. the plates not only tasted well but also looked like a picas "
"nicely furnished and decorated restaurant in a former industrial building, good selection of interesting dishes, all perfectly prepared and nicely presented on the plates, all dishes are served with homemade fries and a salad"
cozy atmosphere. good value for money and tasty food. i had the club sandwich. big portion of food and very tasty.
went for dinner with my husband. because of the nice weather we got a table in the garden. personnel was very friendly and provided very good service. the food was excellent!! we will visit again.
"stopped there just because of being hungry. fortunately we got a nice seat outside in the sun and ordered without seeing the menu, just by the waitress recommendation. i got a tasty cheeseburger: fresh and juicy beef. my wife got the vegetarian burger: the best one ive ever go "
"we hadnt tried het leven before, but went on the recommendation of one of our hotel staff members. great recommendation. it has a pretty laid back atmosphere, reminiscent of a country cottage restaurant. its not big, but clearly popular, so dont expect to get a table straight away if you havent booked. we hadnt, but just got lucky! i get some of the poorer reviews, but many seem to be a result of getting a table on a busy evening and expecting immediate gratification. its not that sort of pla "
"apparently a very busy evening, so it took a while before we were seated. however, once we were, friendly service, nice not too long menu, well cooked. and all for a friendly price, so recommended!"
"eetcafe het leven serves delicious food in a cozy environment. it is a large restaurant but with several rooms that are all uniquely decorated. we each had salads for lunch. the salads were large, delicious and healthy and we all left the restaurant very full and satisfied."
very nice people. the food is very good value for money. the atmosphere is layd back en casual. also recommended for families.
"excellent food, with dishes you do not find elsewhere, all at a reasonble price. very kind staff. for childeren there is a play corner."
the food is good ( but dont expect fine dini 
"it started to rain as i was walking around leeuwarden and there was eetcafe het leven. i decide to try it and stepped inside, asking for a table for one for dinner.i was shown to a nice corner table with room for two. the surroundings were charming, casual, and rustic. the service staff was charmingly friendly, service-minded, and professional. they made me feel that i made a perfect choice when i stepped through their door, not having heard of them - this was my second day ever in leeuwarden. it was quiet when i arrived, but buzzed with life shortly afte "
"the decor is farmhouse chic, very casual and cozy. we had the soup of the day, a chicken cream soup served with big chunks of homemade breads. i had cheese fondue, served with more wonderful bread and a variety of fresh veggies and fruits. my husband had what we would call a pot roast. with all entrees, they serve a salad, chunky french fries, and a veggie mix of peas, beans and asparagus in a mint sauce. everything was top notch. i would go back here again!"
"i love their meat plates, always cooked to perfection. and the broodplank de lux, yummiiii!! well be back soon :)"
what a wonderful experience in our town! the food was the best we ever had. so full of taste and color. a true experience we wont forget!
"great service, historical atmosphere and perfect menue for a good price. we paid 70 euro for two people (3menu, 2 wines and 2 likour). every meal was handmade and the soup was amazing!"

"the restaurant is located in an old palace, where some members of the nassau family lived in the 17th and 18th century. us heit ( our dad ) was william louis, the first count of that family in charge of the northern part of the netherlands. there portraits show strong men and women, the alpha persons of that peri "
you know that feeling that you get when you just have to close your eyes when eating something good? that is what you get at this restaura 
"we had a 5 courses dinner deal for ony 25 euro. every drink that you get will add up to the price though. surrounded by portraits of the nassau family we had a royal dinner in restaurant us heit, really good."
"only ‚Ç¨25 will get you a 5-course fantastic meal; throw in ‚Ç¨23 for a bottle of wine, ‚Ç¨4 for a bottle of water and ‚Ç¨4.5 for a really nice coffee with home-made chocolates and you have a 3-hour diner experience you wont forget for a real bargain!! combine with a stay at the hotel, and a pair will have a great weekend out!"

very nice place. the dinner we had was good and you easily stay longer for drinks. friendly staff. i would recommend to make reservations when you want to eat there in the weekend.

we had a big group dinner recently and were very impressed with the food etc.  good wibes and they did a great job with their food presentation.  we liked how they served their main dishes on a wooden board etc.  definitely will be back.
"i came here for a drink. first i was thinking of taking a cup of tea but there was just tea on the menu, so i decided to take a hot chocolate with cream. with it i ordered an apple pie. service was very quick. almost immediately the hot chocolate arrived together with a very big piece of apple pie, also with a lot of cream. i can tell that i wasnt hungry for dinner. :)"
"favorite grand cafe in leeuwarden. most of the times here for a nice drink on their outside terrace or to overcome a hangover with their terrific 12 uurtje lunch option. great food, large proportions. ever tried a salmon uitsmijter? go for it."
"we always went for a couple of drinks and some food, several times. it looks like a nice old, dark pub and has got a lovely environment. decorations suit the venue and warm and friendly service rounds it of perfectly. i never had any complaints and i went a couple of times during the day and at night. if you eat something there, order inkvisringe :) amazing "
this restaurant has a good extensive menus on offer. the food is served by friendly efficient staff. i had a pepper steak which was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend this restaurant.
a charming place with friendly service and an excellent choice of dishes for lunch. food is good and plentiful. id come again.
we ate there on two separate occasions. the ribs are fantastic! a member of our party had the lamb chops and said they were very good. next time i am in town i will be sure to visit there again.
"nice restaurant, friendly staff and quite big food portions. also a generous amount of cream comes with the appelcake :d"
"in the centre of the city near the central canal there is a fine place to eat, drink and look at the people passing by. young and friendly staff serving nice food."
"my experience here was great. i came here alone. even so, i was accepted to take a seat at one of their tables. took tagliatelle with chicken and a glass of white wine. service was great, food excellent, people were friendly."
was looking for a place to grab some food and spotted this italian place. so decided to grab a pizza and glad of wine.  the combination was good. the pizza was very tasty. too bad i had to leave leeuwarden the next day .
we stopped by here one morning for a few beers and looked at the menu for dinner optio 
"pleasant spot on a square, well patronised by locals, enormous drinks menu, so if you are into gin or cocktails definitely a place to visit. some good drinkable wines at reasonable prices, and the same for the food. italian biased but other choices too, food equally enjoyable at sensible prices. tip try the cheese board plank to go with drinks. note this restaurant only accepts credit cards in payment!!"
i recently visited the fellini city lounge with a large group of friends ( 36) the staff catered well with the large number of customers. the food was delicious and well presented. the drinks menu was also good. all 36 left having enjoyed good food and an enjoyable experience.
simple menu but super tasty food. service very friendly and quick. good relaxed vibe for a city centre lunch.
"nice service, could speak perfect english and had english menus as well. ordered tea which had a wide variety of flavours and the club sandwich which was huge and the ingredients tasted lovely and fresh. would go there again for sure"
went here with a large group of people. still they managed to give us a nice choice of food and service. have an allergy? no problem! even tho its not originally in the set menu they still managed to help out and create a stunning replacement.
this is a very good italian restaurant. the staff were helpful efficient and friendly. the menus was good and the food was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend a visit.
nice atmosphere familie feeling in combination with good food and normalprices close by museum and parking
been here with friends in a raining day of summer. we sit outside anyway and we have great time. the food was really good and the service good also. i will come back for sure.
after visiting the fries museum we went here for an early dinne 
before going to a concert we decided to have dinner close  
"this is a pleasant place with generous portions and cheerful staff. the restaurant is relatively centrally located in a town of very walkable size, and the frisian museum is just next door."
we needed a hand with some of the translation of the menu and the waiter was fabulous. he wasnt sure of a couple of the words so he came back in seconds with his i pad with google translate on it. what service. we had a superb meal too. cant fault the place at all.
"the space in the restaurant allows for comfort. the restaurant has a great atmosphere and good ambience. i went with a party of about 14,- service was good and fairly speedy. though the food is good, portion sizes are far too large and should be cut in half. great cappucino to end off the meal!"
"we spent an evening here with a large group on a busy friday evening. food was fantastic, very authentic turkish cuisine, great lentil soup. service was a bit on the slow side, but given that it was a friday evening and packed, i guess that is understandable."
"great taste and logic price! its one of my fave restaurant in leeuwarden. hidden gem. very good service, good location. this place very good if u come with large group or just with friends. big space dinning area."
food is of excellent quality and taste. friendly staff. certainly recommend this restaurant. they also have a selection for people unfamiliar with the quisine so you can taste different dishes
"inviting ambiance ... relaxed, intimate, easy - well organized - food was serverd quickly and yet delicious  - easy to find, only 10 minutes walking from the station of leeuwarden."
me and my boyfriend went to saray on a saturday night. it is a big restaurant er there was still room for us fortunately! the staff is very friendly and the food is great!
"its not excellent, but its okay. and it really is. shop is clean, waitresses are polite, coffee is allright. dont expect haute cuisine, i think nobody does. but again, it is really okay and a nice spot for a short stay with a hot coffee when youre cold after a city walk or need a rest. "
after the exposition in the fries museum it is very nice to have a goof cup of coffee and dutch appeltaart at doppio.s.
we ate here with a little over a year old and a three year old. and even though id been there before i never realized how kids friendly it was. happily surprised.
"lovely choice of coffees and teas. and not unimportant the food (lunch) is nice as well. quality ingredients, good service."
"doppio is a modern cafe right next to the market place in leeuwarden. it is rather pricey but the food & beverages are amazing and the employees are super friendly and they have great english skills. only neg point is that the cafe has an almost sterile feeling (white tables, arranged in rows)."
"after my recent lovely experience at la cubanita‚Äôs leeuwarden restaurant, i decided to enjoy it some more and give a few more dishes a go, which remained untested on my personal shortli "
"after having spent years having a negative association with the word ‚Äútapas‚Äù, all due to several bad experiences with tapas restaurants serving spanish dishes, i was quite reluctant to visit the tapas place i heard some raving stories about. but after checking out the menu on their website, i decided to give la cubanita a  "
"the staff were all friendly and welcoming and spoke english to me throughout the evening, i was also given the english menu. we paid 22.50‚Ç¨ each and could order 2 dishes at a time, and when we finished them, we could order 2 more etc until we were full. there was also a nice cocktail menu. unfortunately you had to pay extra for desserts but you can just fill up on the tapas dishes instead! very good value for money and really loved the whole evening!"
"we had a great evening at la cubanita in leeuwarden. even though the place was busy, the staff was very kind and attentive.the food was delicious and the whole ambiance with the latin music was great. special thanks to the manager, amanda dekker for taking such good care of us."
what can i say but just great! all you can eat tapas for 22.50 euros (drinks not included) on a saterday evening. (17.50 euro from sunday till thursda 
"monday evening, looking for a place to eat and on recommendation of my daughter i visited la cubanita. the place was not full, so a table without reservation was no porblem. the staff was nice and willing to explain the ordering procedure; select your 2 dishes at a time and write this on a beer mat! when the beer mat is taken, 5 or 10 minutes later your order is being served. fast and very tasty. atmosphere is nice, busy and in spanish/cuban atmosphere. the staff works fast and asks everytime if they are allowed to take the empty plates. the next order is picked up every time they pass your table. cost is low during the week its 17,50 only the drinks and/or cocktails are separate. if you like spanish tapas and you are looking for a relaxed and nice atmosphere surely a place to put in your diary!"
cosy atmosphere.  great price. and an enormous choice of tapas. friendly personel. had a great time with my colleagues
"la cubanita is a great restaurant, one of my favorites. their unlimited tapas deal is decently priced and i love the variety of dishes. i dont appreciate that they dont serve tap water though. i can understand their biggest income is from serving drinks but i wish they understood how bad it feels having to pay 2/3 euro for fancy still water. in terms of customer service i would really start serving your customers tap water. my only recommendation as your food is great and your servers are always very friendly. the water is just a big thing for me. "
great value and such a wide range of cute little bite size tap 
very good pizzas and good service. we ordered our pizzas on the phone and they were ready on due time. the quality is very good for pizzas that are not that expensive.
"apparently these guys just won the best pizza of leeuwarden competition! well, i couldnt agree more! very cozy place, with a lot of great italian dishes on the menu"
"we wanted to order a bottle of whine and we got an excellent recommendation, so ask them about it! the pizzas had a true italian flat crust. we had an amazing dinner, partially due to the lovely waitress."
"lovely atmosphere, had to wait a tad for my food because they were baking it fresh but it was soooo worth it. ordered the lasagna with mozzarella and it was one of the best dishes ive had in my life, my friends both ordered a pizza each and both were really satisfied, would recommend without a doubt "
known mostly by the locals this italian restaurant is one of the hidden gems the city has to off 
"if you want to go for a good pizza and dont want to spend too much, this is the place to go! the pizza is a good size and often the food is ready in no time!"
"made an unplanned stop for pizza.  pizza was authentic italian, a was the wine and service. will be back"
"this is a great restaurant, with amazing food for a decent price. the service of the students is very genuine! can only recommend!"
i have eaten at wannee a few times (for as well dinner and lunch) and it was never disappointin 
absolutely amazing.  a 6 course menu with vegetables at the star. looked like all locks ingredients too.  the staff were absolutely fantastic. what a fantastic introduction to the city.
wonderful in every way is how i would sum up my experience at this restaurant. it is part of the hotel school in leeuwarden and is one of five in the count 
the wonderful restaurant that combines quality and professionalism. great breakfast and magnificent dinner paired with the perfect wines. we are extremely happy with the service.üòÄ
great service with a smile and delicious combination of flavour 
it was delicious. the dishes were well thought and a real discovery. excellent quality and the service was perfect. the staff is very kind and helpful. we had breakfast and lunch there and both times it was awesome. each dish was beautiful.
"not in the city centre but in the middle of a modern campus-like area this is a true surprise. modern concepts both in interior as well as in the (choice of) food. greet looking and tasting dishes , 80 percent vegetable based and typically dutch. even a very nice and good appetizer based on the traditional rustic ‚Äòsnert‚Äô soup. the young student staff provides exceptional professional service."
the menu changes regularly so its not so hard to come back again soon. we had the six course fixed menu which was totally full of trea 
"this is an amazing restaurant, one of the most creative ive ever ate at. we had the six course tasting menu. first we were seated in the bar and given three snacks, more like amuses: freeze dried vegetables, a one-bite fish taco, and a cucumber based drink. then we were seated in the very spacious dining room which had two tables for groups of 10 and maybe 8 tables for couples. it is very modern style, with very high ceilings. at night it is very atmospheric, with low lightin "

looking for a new experience in leeuwarden i stumbled onto this restaurant. initially i didnt know it was part of the leeuwarden hotel schoo 
"a couple of weeks ago we went to wannee. it was a surprising experience, in it‚Äôs most positive meaning! we were welcomed in the bar with a glass of cava and several appetizers, among which the beetroot dim sum üëåüèΩ. the restaurant has a very open and modern design that suits the atmosphere. the diner menu is based on the 80/20 principle and surprises you with very tasty and appealing dishes such as kfc cauliflower (better than the actual kfc ü§´) and a beautiful beluga style version of potato and leek. cassian served us some great wines (and some great stories!) and j yoon and irene served us in a very hospitable and professional way. we stayed in notiz hotel, so we were lucky and got to enjoy breakfast in wannee as well. wannee serves a standard breakfast √°nd an a la carte breakfast. on this a la carte menu you find both local and international bites, which are a great contribution to your breakfast! we especially loved the french toast and the miso soup. during breakfast we were served by mark, who was just a natural. long story short; when in leeuwarden, visit wannee. the food, the drinks, but especially the hospitality of the students guarantee a great experience!"
modern restaurant at the higher hotel school to train the future hoteliers. we had the 4 course menu with the wine arrangement that serves typically dutch dishes in a modern version; we liked the taste of the food and the friendly service. tip of the day; order the coffee service with chocolate surprises! 
"this restaurant is at the stenden hotel and managed by the students. rated one of the top 100 vegetable restaurants in the world. yes they have also proteins, but the focus is 80% vegetables and 20% proteins. very nice to see students under the leadership of this amazing chef who runs a very large f&b organization. with some 3,000 students and many different outlets, this is one very large organization. bravo!!"
"never found better service. the staff was very helpful, nice and friendly. the food was of an unexpected quality. a place to come back!"
"we were extremely surprised at the quality, creativity and variety of the light four course and six course menus availab "
this is how simple and good food can  
"we have visited wannee for breakfast staying at stenden hotel last august and were so impressed decided to come back. well, fine dining delivered! their values are quality, health, value, organic and local. delicious food and wine, relaxing atmosphere, lovely staff and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable. we will be back once in this neck of the woods. thank you, great job! "
"i have stayed at stenden hotel numerous times and breakfast at wannee is always excellent. the restaurant is clean, service is very good and variety of buffet is excellent. additionally omletts, egg benedict and other breakfast items can be ordered. coffee and juices are of excellent quality. the buffet station is user friendly in that it is divided into two sections, thus uncluttering any guests who take from the buffet simultaneously."
albert kooy is a champion of the new dutch cuisine. on the basis of sometimes old and forgotten vegetables he creates real amazing dishes. with this he inspires (and teach) the international hospitality students who run this restaurant. they do so with great enthusiasm. it was one of my best (and i have been in quite a few) restaurant experiences in holland. at a price level just above fast food you eat and have an experience at michelin star level.
"okay, we did not expect this...but what a find! located in the training facility of the stenden hotel, this restaurant serves a killer meal for a extremely friendly price. they use the 80-20 concept (80% vegetable-20% protein) and still manage (üòâ) to produce excellent dishes! we will be back!"
"wannee is a food adventure in a beautiful dining room. in the centre is a fire element circled by rosemary citrus and chili plants. lots of wood and space to really enjoy the amazing creations in which local veges are the heroes. yesterday the 6-course meal included venison, sweetbread, jerusalem artichokes, salsify, chicory, and they were prepared with so much passion, it was such a joy to eat. we chose a 4- course wine menu too and the wines just perfected the dishes and the other way rou "
my wife and i ate here and found it to be a great restaurant. i was a bit skeptical because it is in a university and all of the servers are students. this turned out to be a big plus. what any of our servers lacked in experience was made up by their enthusiasm and genuine care to ensure we were treated well. we each opted for the multicourse menu - i had the 6 dish and my wife the 4 dish. each of us opted for the same number of wine pairing. each of the courses was outstanding and the wines complemented each. our servers explained each course and provided details on each wine. our entre 
"as we owned and ran restaurants a teaching restaurant is fun. here food is also excellent and wine is interesting. very reasonable price. service young but professional, we had business to talk and did so effectively. no muzak. good acoustics. recommendable!"
"as an alumni, stayed in the hotel for one night to celebrate my graduation. came for lunch in the restaurant and me and my girlfriend had 4 courses with the wine arrangemen "
"the food was excellent and imaginative. the accompanying wines carefully chosen. the service was perfect. all of this for an incredibly low price. if we had been staying longer, we would have gone back!"
"the service at wannee is very good, considering that most of the waiters and waitrons are students doing real world learning. i had breakfast at wannee for 5 days recently and the breafast buffet variety is excellent. the variety of various egg dishes that can also be ordered in addition to the buffet, are absolutely magnificent, and the young chef who was on duty 4 of the 5 days is extremely passionate about the entire experience of food preparation which follows through in the taste and presentation of dishes. the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. particularly recommendable are the eggs benedict. the restaurant is very clean and the aesthetically pleasing environment creates an all round gastronomic expereince. the best is the variety of deliciously prepared breads and rolls - real comfort food!"
nobody should left leeuwarden without a dinner or lunch in this restaura 
"charming, original and beautiful dishes. friendly and authentic service. very affordable with the course options. what a gem of a place!"
"i had a lunch with 2 friends, the food was good and the price is not high. friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere! i recommend restaurant wannee"
"excellent food, excellent plating, excellent service, excellent prices. i will return to this place for sure."
"we ate 5 verry tastefull courses in this teaching restaurant. the studentes explained with every course, in good english, what was served. the ingredients use are very green and pure. the decoraties is like cousy industrial. i liked it vera michael. if i had not known, i would not have noticed it was a teaching restaurant. would go here again!"
"searching the best restaurant in leeuwarden through the tripadvisor app, it led me to this restaurant, wannee. we had to walk a bit because it is located outside of the centrum, but it was worth every step, this is why "
"its been a pleasure to eat in restaurant wannee. great food, nice service by young professionals. also the atmosphere is really fresh. will definitely come back next year"
"6 course delicatessen matched with 6 wines for a total of ‚Ç¨53,20 best value for money ever. everything was perfect. a must when visiting leeuwarden"
just be mindful that if going to breakfast late thet will not necessarily replenish everything do have the taster mennu!
"nice place to be, good food, diets are no problem at all. its a school and restaurant in one. you notice that but its not annoying."
my wife and i stayed at the leeuwarden school of hospitality hotel. attached to this is their restaurant wannee. the entire complex is run by students and if their efforts are any indication then the netherlands can look forward to an excellent level of service in the hospitality indust 
a pleasant restaurant with fine ambience. its a student run place as part of the university hotel. highly recommended as is the local wheat beer!
fantastic echte dutch experience for breakfast - everything from boerenkool and nasi goreng for breakfast plus the best freshly-baked bread with all the toppings youd expect in the netherlands: hagelslag and jam!
"i was in leeuwarden on business staying in the wtc hotel and a german colleague of mine took me to this restaurant. outstanding from arrival to departure. its a training college for the hotel trades and most of the staff are trainees. i was a bit dubious upon or arrival as the restaurant was very quiet but my attitude soon changed. our waitress - miri - was from budapest- and she was brilliant. she was smart, articulate and explained all about the meals and wines. we opted for the six course taster menu with wines and each and very course was a taste explosion absolutely stunning. from presentation to taste, tip top in every way. the supervisor - angelina and the restaurant manager - yannich (i think thats how you spell his name) - were extremely helpful in every way. i cannot understand why the restaurant was so empty as it was only 30 euros for the six course taster menu - absolute bargain. we went the next night and the place was packed and due to staff shortages they were only doing the 6 course taster menu - but yannich had a word with the kitchen and we could choose from the normal menu. you have got to visit this place ts brilliant. well done to all the trainees and the experts in the background."
wannee is overseen by a master chef and run by the hospitality students at stenden. we had the 3 course with the 3 wine pairings. portions were small and creatively plated. service was impeccable.
"the restaurant is run by the students at stenden university with input from expert staff. chef albert kooy has devised a menu heavily focused on fresh, local dutch food and cuisine. the intent is to represent dutch food (min 80%) and local produce. the menu is planned emphasizing seasons, health, taste, and local traditions keeping animal protein at 20%. they offer a fixed-price menu allowing for 3-6 courses. wines have been chosen by their resident registered vinoloogs (rv), mr. douwe wiersma and mr. shane de bruijn. rv is a certification offered by the dutch wine acade "
we had 6 courses. each course was good of taste. very attentive service by students of .stenden. nice place to sit. in summer you also can have dinner outside.
"the menu formula is orginal, each course comes for 6 euros.  nice, open restaurant with lots of daylight.  very attentive service."
"this restaurant run by students of the stenden university is one of the best restaurants ive been to. the portions are rather small but with just 15 ‚Ç¨ for a 3 course menu you cant go wrong. the dishes are very tasty because the restaurant places importance to each ingredient they use as they hold a 80:20 concept. 80 % vegetables, 20% meat. definitely recommending this to anyone who prefers vegetables over meat and rural ingredients. the staff is very friendly, attentive and makes sure that all is to your satisfactio "
"i went to dinner at restaurant wannee with a friend of mine and it was an absolutely amazing experience. we had the 3 course menu for which we chose the spinach salad with mullet, the chicken wings with stars and stripes and the strawberries desert with basil sorbet which blew us away. the dishes are designed so that the natural flavors of the ingredients can be tasted and experienced ful "
"we had 2 top evenings having dinner here last evening and today. very friendly staff. students from the stenden university. they do this more than ok. food was very good. small portions, but if you take the 6 course diner( only 30 euro )very tasty and special sometimes :) and the accompagnied wines, you will have a very nice evening. enjoy, i know we have :)"
"small portions make one great meal with lots of varieties. real hostmanship, high quality! good wines. it is only the location but with a good walk you easily end up in this great place."
this was my 2nd time dining there and it was even more delicious than the first time. despite that students so the cooking and serving you feel like you are in a high ranked restaurant with pretty low prices. we were lucky to taste new menu of 6 courses. each of them was surprisingly tasty and rich of flavours. portions were small (cannot be otherwise with 6-course menu) but at the end you feel pretty full. this restaurant will definately stay in our list for the future.
"first class dining on a budget. this restaurant offered a surprisingly fresh, modern and engaging menu with an even better value. we enjoyed a 8 course tasting menu with a variety of dishes, most of them with local ingredients. i like the focus of vegetables and less on meat and fish."
"this is a good restaurant if you come as a couple, but also with a family. it is cozy, relaxed atmosphere, and the personnel was very friendly on both times we were ther "

"wonderful atmosphere, friendly and quick service, the pannekeoks were very, very good and the pricing is ok."
"we visited as a family of 6 and my elderly parents requested small pancakes as they couldnt face a large one. each one of us enjoyed the experience, although we almost had to be rolled out of the ship as they are so filling. in the heatwave it was a little stuffy, but the staff are friendly and our waitress thought we were german before serving us in english - amazing to be accommodated in our language with such ease. well done to the manageress who served us, i only wish i spoke dutch as well as you spoke english - thank you."
"restaurant in a boat, beautifully decorated. good pancakes, friendly staff. tons of pancakes to choose from."
"i really like this place to have lunch or dinner, especially to go there with people who have not been in the netherlands or groningen. the restaurant itself is in a ship, which by itself is an experience and a great environment. they serve a lot of different pancakes: from the typical sweet ones to the pizza like pancakes."
we went with 8 persons (including 4 kids) and had great pancakes. service was friendly and fast. the pancakes were excellent! the restaurant is in an old freight-ship which is located in a canal just outside the city centre. this gave it a very special atmosphere.
"the baby and i shared a lovely, big apple and ginger pancake - think pizza size. the staff were all friendly and accommodating, bringing high chairs and a toy. its quite dark inside and the canal your window is next to might not always be the cleanest but definitely recommend for food and just enjoying being on a boat. "
this is a great place for families. good food and a cosy atmosphere. ill be making regular trips there with my 2 young boys.
"a great budget buy. had the bacon, ham, and cheese pancake and could not finish it all even though i wanted to try a sweet pancake as well as a savory. quick service. very very family oriented so expect lots of children and the accompanying noise."
great find catering to every taste. also had gluten-free selection for everything which was really great. staff was friendly and very attentive especially with children. definitely worth a visit.
i love this ship. big and good pancakes in a ship with pirate decor. the restaurant chef is really kind. if you have just a little hunger you can share your pancake in two.
"a dutch pancake is a treat ... and ours were huge - larger than the plate they were served on. i had the ginger and he had the apple, we could hardly finish them - good value for the food and a novelty to be aboard a real ship and looking out the portholes at the various boats passing on the canal. service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere laid back and unfussy - we were not disappointed with our meal or our service."
the pancakeship is not only a destination for our little friends. also adults can enjoy an adventure on the pancake ship. lovely (huge) pancakes that can be either sweet or savery.
"there are many choices for the topping, and they dare to combine with asian taste such as pecel with sate sauce. and they give discount for students, too. nice! :)"

"just back from dinner here and in a euphoric state. every mouthful made my eyes pop, full of superlative flavours especially the pear with citrus ice cream and the thing with goats cheese and sea lettuce - ooooooh! a fabulous and memorable experience. thank-you to the kitchen and friendly front-of-house crew at eindeloos, i will remember this night of happy foodie highs xxx"
"my wife and i have known the chef and owner willem schaafsma ever since he started here 9 years ago. under previous ownership the place already had a good reputation and willem has been able to not only keep it up, but improve further. while using much local and biological ingredients he time and again knows to surprise with imaginative and creative dishes. even the amuse bouches are special and delicious. the, partly new, staff was very friendly and knowledgable. no wonder, since willem enjoys training staff himself. his jre membership is certainly warrented."
"this restaurant serves delightful and very creative dishes, abundant with flavours and texture made from seasonal and regional ingredients. the menu is a surprise, but dont let that stop you from visiting. every course is intelligently designed and as their flavour strength and their volume increases so do the matching wines. the rhythm and pace of the courses are perfect, giving you the chance to savour the experience. staff is very polite, helpful and friendly."
we had a 4 course surprise menu accompanied by some amuses. all the courses were creative and well prepared. all the products are sourced local and the staff can tell where they come from.
we came to leeuwarden for business and it‚Äôs rare when you have a beautiful time as a family while traveling for work. incredible two hours to rest and immerse yourself into conversations while kind and warm people help you to understand how different tastes are combined within the most delicious mousses and main courses. beautiful evening with incredibly welcoming and kind people who work at the restaurant!
"a warm welcome,we selected the 6 course meal with the wines.good service throughout with fun explanations of the wines that accompanied each dish. also the dishes were fully described and were all very enjoyable.attention to allergy details for one of us was very professionally dealt with and did not distract the enjoyment of the meal. we couldn‚Äôt wish for a better celebration of our 35th wedding anniversary. when visiting holland again, we will definitely come back."

"we were so lucky that our bed & breakfast in leeuwarden recommended eindeloos. it came highly recommended and did not disappoint. you choose the number of courses you want (we chose 5) and then the menu is a total surprise, and up to the whimsy and imagination of the chef and his use of locally sourced seasonal ingredients. there is no written menu; you can mention anything you do not want/like to eat. then you sit back, and prepared to be wowed by fabulous course after course, starting with 4 amuse bouches, followed by our faultess, well-executed 5 courses. we chose the wine pairing to accompany our menu, and the pairings were excellent. we speak basic dutch and the attentive staff went out of their way to meticulously explain each course in english. the entire evening was a culinary adventure. we look forward to returning to eindeloos/leeuwarden to experience the chefs gourmet exploration of ingredients in another season."

the particularity of this restaurant is that it offers various surprise menus of a chosen number of courses taking into consideration the clients food preferences. we chose a three course fish menu which going along became a four course menu inserting a delicious selection of cheeses before the desert. the dinner started off with a number of delicious amuse-bouches and others to follow in between the various dishes. everything was prepared with great care and inspiration. a fair selection of wine was available by the glass so to combine and taste different wines with each dish. overall a different dining experience. service was very good with perfect explanation of what each dish consisted of. no idea though beforehand how much any given menu would cost (they propose up to eight courses if you wish meat dishes to be included). thus also the total charge will be a surprise. in this case we both agreed that the ratio quality to cost was very reasonable. i definitely would recommend this restaurant which besides the surprise of the food also offers a pleasant and calm atmosphere.
"its not an easy task to find a good restaurant when visiting the northern dutch provinces and although there are some good ones, eindeloos is really the best. cooking is on michelin star level, and service is good and quirky. the menu options, we took the 3 course but you can take more, are easy to understand and the options offered were excellent. reluctantly i ate pigs tongue, which was really good and soup with frisian dry sausage foam, which was a novelty for me and tasted very nice. we paid 60 euro/head (tips inlcuded) including wine which is a very good deal for the quality and the service offered. i will definitely come back to eindeloos."
we had the 5 course surprise menu wich in the end had turned into somewhere between 9-10 small and bigger plates of delicious food. be very hungry before you enter eindeloos because they will fill you up...the service was the best with several waitresses and the chef and owner himself serving you.  
"decoration is simple but the restaurant is full on a weekday tuesday: the kitchen is valued, and rightly so. no menu, 3, 4 or 5 courses with only fresh products. choice of meat or fish and the milk allergy of my partner is meticulously considered. every dish is a picture and all the flavors show to full advantage. the waiters are very attentive and informative. good choice of wines by the glass and unusual: a white portuguese turns to be perfect and the red italian is a hit. here you will gladly return."
"this restaurant received very high scores and we can only agree with these evaluations. although the interiour is not quite special, we appreciate the different photographs on the wal "
"we spent an evening during the week in this restaurant and ordered a 5-course dinner which was accompanied by a wine set. the food was fantastic and got better after each round. the wines perfectly suited the food. service was very helpful, friendly and provided handy advises. a must when in town! make sure to reserve a table since it might get busy depending on the season."
we had booked for lunch but were not advised that we could only get a set menu. menu was enjoybale and we had a very long and also enjoyed the french wines.
"as one of many restaurants we enjoyed during a gourmet tour of friesland by boat this one stands out! first of all, there is no menu. one just selects the number of courses youd like to have and the food starts coming... one of our party is restricted to a gluten free diet but the chef accomodated him as readily as everyone else. the meal began with three elegant and delicious amuses and their promise was maintained throughout the dinner. two of our dishes included both meat and fish, which is unusual, but they were beautifully paired to great effect. if you decide eat at eindeloos set aside the evening to dine. the courses were spaced well apart in time, we would have prefered they move along a little faster. dishes were appropriately sized - not overwhelming but we certainly felt well fed by the evenings end."
"if you would like to visit a great chinese restaurant, to have a big fantastic dinner and enjoy of nice atmosphere, i recommend this restaurant definitely. you will find here delicious chinese cuisine, big portions of any dishes, very attentive host and very nice prices. enjoy the garden of china in wonderful leeuwarden!"
this place has been around since i was a child an visited my grandfather its has lots of memories an still the ‚Äúbami with noodles‚Äù taste the same that must be a plus that food travels with time. had a lovely meal an the price is still good. found out that is now owned by second generation of the uncle our family knew when i was teenager. would definitely recommend
"i went to leeuwarden for business ,and chose this restaurant to have a diner after having the meeting .the waiter is very friendly when we walked into the restaurant,we said we want to try some real chinese food,they recommended some food ,and i want it cooked very spicy ,it turned out the chief didnt make us disappointed,the food is very amazing !i come to here again next time !"
"everything was very tasty. we ordered indonesian rise table and house rames. this gave us a large selection of small dishes to try. each one was delicious and beautifully presented, being kept warm on heated trays. with both rice and noodles a great meal. coffee or tea included."
"this is a really wonderful place after i tasted all chinese restaurant in leeuwarden, the food is always fresh and well-portion, the owner has very good manner and welcomed us, also it was a rainy day, they even offered us cup of warm drink and tissue ! at the end of my trip , i organized a party with my friends with a buffet. the food was really good and had a really good experience in leeuwarden ! the owner always came to us to ask if the food is good, i really cant understand that person who said the worst food and service how it comes, maybe he went to the wrong restaurant? i m really appreciated that had a good time and knew those lovely people in leeuwarden! üòä definitely will come back one day! "
"we enjoy their take-away menus, they are good in flavors and absolutely fair in price. the service is always nice, and normally quite fast. whenever feeling for a dutch-chinese meal, this is the place to be! see you soon."
"i discovered this restaurant when i was studying at stenden many years ago. my partner and i have been going regularly ever since. we went for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic last week and the food did not disappoint! if youd like to eat there on a saturday, i highly recommend you make a reservatio "
we loved the foo 
jamuna restaurant is located in the center of leeuward 
"just perfect , right in the city center, friendly and well organized service! the food was fresh warm and very tasty! the even prepared the meal for our daughter spontaneously gluten free by request which it definitely w "
a really nice indian restaurant with traditional food. correct and polite service. for indian food lovers a really good place.
"great indian food! the chicken tiki masala could be a bit less sweat and a bit more kick. but the shrimp were amazing. great food if you want a bit more spice in your food instead of the others that are all a bit the same. also for the students in this ‚Äústudent city‚Äù, it‚Äôs well priced for very good food. "
"we had a start-of-the-vacation dinner with son/wife and 3 grandchildren. son and wife know the place better than we, although having been here before, and made sure we did not order too much food, my wife and i like at least a threecourse dinner, but at jamuna the starters are almost a full meal, so we restricted ourselves to different main courses. the children had a kids-menu, which gave them exactly what they want "
"we came here with the four of us, we had reservations (recommended!) and over some nice glass of indian red wine we ordered chicken masala, trout, dal and another dish i cannot remember alongside with garlic and sesame naan. the food was delicious, i had medium spicy and could easily go with hot spicy. the restaurant was very nice and the service was tops. if you in leeuwarden and feel like indian food, i highly recommend this place. you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"great atmosphere, friendly and keen stuff, delicious food -  what else needed for perfect dinner with family!?!"
"being a real indian food lover i visited many indian restaurants. this one suprised me with really tasty dishes, cooked from fresh ingredients. even on a weekdag, the placement is busy and you better make a reservation! really recommended for taste, price, friendly staff."
"we had a meal with large group pf 14. food and service vey good! nice presentation, everyone was enthousiastic, even those who never enjoyed and indian meal before"
"we found this place on tripadvisor and due to the positive reactions we reserved a spot here on saturday evening (which was necessary!). and the positive reactions were right. the food is amazing, the staff is friendly, prices are good and it is a cozy place. we took the chicken tikki masala & the korai gosht (which is a bit spicy). we can definitely recommend it!"
"the atmosphere there was quite great, the service (could be a bit faster) was very attentive and the food. the food was amazing, very flavorful and amazingly well prepared. the lamb as promised was tender, chicken was juicy. the only slight downside were the mushrooms in the dishes. they felt watery. overall anwell worth experience, worth another visit when i have more time"
"when you visit a popular busy restaurant inevitably you will have to wait a little to be served. definitely the case here but when the food arrives you realize it‚Äôs worth the wait. inspired menu with a choice of diverse dishes. warm plates, food warmers and generous portions add to the experience but the taste explosions are the star. "
"had the chicken tikka masala, just the right amount of spicy for me, my colleagues had the murg madras, warning, its very spicy! :-d"
the curry was just the right amount of heat. i regret not being able to go more than once. just beat the the crowd.
visited with young children and their grandparents with a range of languages - the whole family was made welcome and the service was relaxed and friendly.  food was very good and well presented. decor was themed but without being too cliched.  good vegetarian selection.
"food was very tasty and service was top notch. waitress was very aware of glutenfree diet necessary to our daughter. athmosprere, price and quality all deserves 5 stars!"
nicely presented and tasty food. the service was very friendly and efficien 
the best indian i have had by far and the best meal ive had whilst on the continent in the last two weeks.
"one entered the premises on the say so of a business associate. we were promptly met by a delightful lady (although her indian origins were questionable) who sat as in the corner whilst making a table for us. we approached our freshly laid table and as you do, sniffed the table cloth and immediately approved. like an indian meado "
"we visited this restaurant on a monday night and were almost put off by a party of 24 who were already seated. however, on the assurance of our waitress that no great delays etc., would occur we sat down. we had the usual popadoms and some lovely unusual tamarind dip. after which we had three curries between us. my wife likes prawns, and that curry was good. the fish curry was even better, but the lamb madras was really excellent. big pieces of tender lamb that had been marinated so long that the taste was right in the meat. hot and spicy and the best curry i have had for years."
"the food in this restaurant, especially the thalis, is very tasty! good variety and also lots of vegetarian options"
"we really enjoyed having dinner at this lovely restaurant. the menu was very varied, and the prices very reasonable. we opted for the set menu(thali royal) and it was delicious. every dish was explained by the hostess together with some cultural background, making the experience complete."
"very popular in leeuwarden this is the place to be if you crave for indian food in the netherlands, though the spices been mellowed down to cater to european platter it still is true to its country of origi "
"in december ive been to this restaurant with my family. its quite a small but very attractive restaurant. the walls are decoracted with indian statues, lights, paintings etc. the service was slow, in my opinion a little too slow. we arrived at 7 pm but the waiter asked just 30 minutes later what we wanted to drink. most of the staff doesnt speak dutch, but they do understand amd speak english. we ordered 3 different menus. one vegetarian, one meat and one mixed meat/vegetables menu. the food was absolutely delicious. the nice thing is that you can taste out of every little pan. so you eat a varierty of food served with naanbread. overal i had a great evening and i ate more than enough meals."
"i ordered the jamuna special biryani. and it was truly delicious. regardless of the price of ‚Ç¨15, it scored very high on my expectation looking at a small town like leeuwarden. really love the way they keep our food warm, so it doesnt get cold as few minutes pass by."
"if we go to leeuwarden, we always try to have a meal here. thank goodness we reserved, as it was full and busy like a beehive and people were waiting for a free table. we already knew what we wanted to order, same procedure as every time we go, the thali dish, and so did not need to look at the menu and then wait again for our order to be taken. the staff were all friendly, the meal served hot and we were not disappointed, it was still as good as the last time we had eaten here. if you go, i would recommend you reserve. mondays closed."
"this is my favourite indian restaurant in leeuwarden. maybe even my favourite indian restaurant ever! i have been going here for about 8 years and its always a treat. i love the atmosphere with the indian nicknacks and music. ive tried quite a few things on their menu and everything has been delicious. the last time i went it was even better than i remember! our go-to favourite is the spinach and chicken dish. the channa masala is also really good. oh and get some peshwari naan, you wont regret it! "
"this is a rare indian restaurant. i am a fan of indians but jamuna is one of the best ive tried. the starter was an explosion of flavours with a fantastic and light dressing, and i had never tasted something like the two main courses we tried. service was fast and effective and the setting avoids to much kitsch. will definitely retur (with clothes that can easily be washed, we still have a strong smell on our coats :))."
"we arrived back from the wadden island late in leeuwarden, and although it was saturday night, we could feel it would not be easy to find a place to e "
"indian is one of my favourite cuisines so i usually look out for a decent indian restaurant on my travels. this one, whilst not up amongst the best, was pretty good and ill come back if im in this neighbourhood again. the service was a little slow but its fair to say the restaurant was very bus "
"if you are from the uk and end up, for your sins, in friesland then head to leeuwarden and visit jamuna. fantastic food, atmosphere and wonderful staff.  well worth a visit."
"one of my favorite restaurants in leeuwarden. the food is excellent, and the owners are friendy.  would recommend it to all my friends and family."
"brilliant food in a relaxed, cosy and no-nonsense restaurant. both service and dishes are great: ranging from friendly mild to challenging hot. an absolute must-visit when in town"
"we love the spicy food and here it is very good. if you gonna eat here , you have to wait for √† long time before diner is served , but its worth."
"this is one of my favourite restaurants in leeuwarden. the food is delicious and i love trying different dishes (almost) every time i go. i would recommend the samosas, chicken and spinach (murg aur palak i believe), and peshwari naa "
"very good food. we always take the vegetarian menu. we never can eat dessert because we are so full. the food is great, fresh and smells wonderfu "
we are visiting leeuwarden for a shorter period and have had our late dinner twice from this place. both times we have been very satisfied. only done the take away part but been well happy both times.
a really hidden jewel of a restaurant! cheap but very delicious and tasty food! although the restaurant interior is somewhat tired this is fantastic value for money!
"third time to jamuna and this time slightly disappolinted, mainly due to the service. long wait for menus, to order drinks, for them to arrive, to order food and even longer wait for it to arrive. ok, it was a friday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was full, but theres a simple answer...get more staff if you cant cope!! another thing, i had booked a table for six which wasnt ready for us.... anyway, when my eventually food arrived it was pretty good. as always i chose two veggie side dishes, masoor dal and chana masala, with rice and an onion nan. the dal was a good consistency and nice and garlicy, the chana masala pleasantly spicy. the dissappointment was the onion nan. it was obviously factory made and looked like the ones you can buy at the supermarket."
"we just landed here for a quick dinner, and as it had 4 stars we decided to give it a  "
"i have been having dinner on jamuna several times over the years. i believe that the first time was back in year 2000 and when i am in town, this is one of the places i will return to. the food has never been disappointing, tonight i got murgh madras which in this restaurant is spicy. i once tried the vindaloo version and that was really hot. the menu card will warn you - as will the staff! if you are in town and if you like indian food, then this place is worth a visit. it has been in business for at least 12+ years so that speaks for itself i guess."
"i went to jamuna with colleagues several times and was always satisfied. once i took people from india, who told me they also liked the food and thought it was prepared very similar to the way it would have been at their homes. i suggest you order several dishes to share at the table."
"we had a lovely dinner at this restaurant. the setting is average and masks the fact that this is a quality restaurant. the staff is very friendly and helpful. once we got the food we loved it. great choice and everything we ordered was delicious but boy did we have to wait long for it! that would be the only reason dor us not to return with our 10 year old. if you like a long evening in a restaurant, this is the place ro be!"
we always treat ourselves to a meal here when we are in the neighbourhood. the food is very good and reasonably priced. we would recommend reserving a table as the restaurant is usually quite full. tel. 058 213 14 35. it is closed on mondays. open from 17.00-22.00 and also offers take-aways.
i think there should be many more indian restaurants in holland as it really is a treat! jumana has a good choice of food for everyone at very reasonable prices. the staff are friendly sometimes a little slow but i think the staff change quite often as i have never seen the same people there twice (apart from the managers.) i would defiantly recommend this restaurant as its truly delicious and a great way to end a nice day of shopping in leeuwarden.(the chicken pure as a starter is amazing and i enjoy the tikka masala as a main course it has a nice bite of chilli to it) all dishes come with rice but you can order potatoes and nan bread with it also.
"indian food is not as well known in nl as it is in the uk. in leeuwarden the jamuna offers a good introduction. well balanced flavours, and spicy enough for any taste."
"with our children we frequently enjoy their vegetarian tali. the food is of a very high quality, the service is great en the price is low for what you get. the restaurant is popular, so its wise to make a reservation if you are with a group. highly recommended, also for vegetarians."
"we got ourselves the meatball, unfortunately they did not have the lowcarb bread. however, the lunch was very tasty and the home made meatball with gravy and crispy bacon tasted delicious. service with a smile, even the cook brought the plates in herself and again appologized for not having the requeted lowcarb bread. when visiting leeuwarden, we will surely get another dish from the menu!"
great food and really fast and friendly service. we recommend it to anyone looking for a place to have a nice lunch and we‚Äôll come back for sure next time we are in leeuwarden.
"they serve a good lunch, much choise and friendly, efficient service. i went for beef croquettes and my wife ordered a snack plate. good quality and a pleasant plce to go."
amazing food local produced and sustainable and the people who works there are super nice :d we had the carpaccio and the healthy sandwich.... yummy üòã  sorry i just remembered i should have take photo once i finished the food üòõ

"whether you want a decent coffee, a cool drink or a nice lunch, this is the place to be. situated in one of the most picturesque shopping streets in leeuwarden, (currently cultural capital of europe 2018) it offers a friendly atmosphere that appeals to young and old. quality of everyting they serve is excellent, and staff is very friendly. most welcoming."
great to see so much attention in everything. its clear these guys are passionate for food. love this place. we will return here soon.
we were here for an quick bite before we headed off on our tour of leeuwarden. had good tasty food (vegetarian options as well) which was well presented and filling. the guys at the restaurant were extremely helpful - they clearly had a good taste for beer with an excellent collection and made a very good recommendation for o 
wonder full cafe   that speaks english   wholesome snacks serving a range of fortified coffees  and beers
barrevoets is managed by two young guys that spell hospitality with a capital  
"this is a small but very cosy place. it does not matter if you only want a coffee or you want to eat something, they offer various options! it is very nice that in the menu you can see if a dish has som alergenic ingredients (soya, milk, eggs, gluten, dairy...). the staff is very friendly and willingto help, reccomend something to eat or to visit. i had something like a hamburger (it had amsterdam in the title) because it was a reccomendation and it was wonderful. coffee is great also!"
"ive entered the barrevoets and was warmly welcomed in by a lovely lady. eventhough she barrels spoke english she waitressed my and guided me through the dutch menu. i was ging to visite some otter planes blut felt so cosy there, that ive spendt hours there drinking and eating. in you visite leeuwarden go to the barrevoets. its worte it!"
"located in an street filled with interesting little shops. barrevoets is a great place for coffee and a healthy bite. the service is really good. for the boys and girls who like a good beer. this is also the place for you, and if you are lucky they will tell you the story behind that pacific beer your drinking . or just ask ;)"
"went here for an early lunch on a saturday.  was quite nice.  had two sandwiches, of which one was the dutch specialty raw beef. would come back."
"happened to wander in to taste the dutch fries with a mayo dip, popular in the netherlands. the fries were cooked to order and very tasty! some places told me they fry in pork fat, so you might ask if you care."
"went to the place with a friend of mine on a relaxing afternoon and was more than happy that we chose that place ! very relaxing atmosphere, the guys working there were very friendly and they have great variety of tea and bio smoothies ! didnt try the cakes, but will definitely do next time:) "
"barrevoets is my piece of heaven in leeuwarden. the best homemade cakes i have tasted in leeuwarden, to die for smoothies and i highly recommend the wraps which comes with mouth watering homemade pesto. i appreciate that the food is fresh and one can taste the freshnes "
nice restaurant on the waters edge very pleasant and helpful staff we both had the pork loin with satay good choice .comfortable seats and pleasant location on the waterside. would definitely recommend
"eating outside at de koperen tuin is like taking a mini-break. surrounded by birds, huge trees and the sound of the fountain without any traffic going past is bliss. we had the flatbread with smoked salmon. yum! they also serve soy lattes and the coffee is excellent. "
we chose a sunny day so sat outside - the sound of the fountain softly splashing as we drank our queen g&ts with red fruit. just what the doctor ordered. the staff are very attentive and just want to make you happy. when we left they said they hoped we would be back soon. i will. my friend is heading to spain for at least a year but if she comes back to visit i bet it will be her number one location to catch up.
"great cake and coffee, good service and relaxed environment. first visit but will definitely not be our last."
staff very friendly ambiance very good location very good menu size good food portion good food quality average very affordable
we arrived in leeuwarden by boat and asked a few locals about good food for the 2 couples aboard and was recommended to de koperen tuin and was very pleased with the excellent quality of food and excellent service. i had the salmon with dill sauce and my wife had the beef stew along with a great vanilla chocolate dessert. highly recommend the restauaunt.
"with the nice weather on my daytrip to leeuwarden today i included a nice stroll in the citypark prinsentuin, where i stumbled upon this neat grand caf√© with a terrace, located on top of a little hill overlooking a pond with fountain and a small outdoor musicha "
before we visit the pubs for a evening with friends we started the evening with a fine diner at the koperen tuin. very good service en fine food. the price is right. they served fine wine and they have very good single malt wiskye.
the view and the tranquility makes this place a must... beautiful garden around with the river on the back.... good prices all around and amazing view to the pond!
"wonderful terrace, its flooded with light, theres things to see, the snack & beer menu is good, the local speciality beers are tasty, as are the crispy bitterballen with hot & sweet mustard. the staff is friendly and engaged and not at all pretentious. its a pleasure to go there after a visit to the museum."
"to enjoy a few drinks in the early evening i visited this new establishment housed within the zaailand mall building, by the museum and filmhuis arthouse cine "
great place to go for a cheap quick noodle based meal. eveything cooked fresh and lots of choice. its like a subway style selection process and then a choice of noodles.   well worth going and very well priced .
"went here for the first time with my friend and we loved the food. it was also fun to choose what we want for our bowl. although the portion was too big for us, its worth it! i tried the tokyo teriyaki sauce and will come back again to try the other sauces üòã"
lovely place to eat and menu easy to follow.  you can see all that is available on display.  very quick service and reasonable prices.  you can try chopsticks if you want!
i went to this wok for a cheap dinner during my visit to leeuwarden. they serve nice asian fast food with a friendly pri 
"great fresh food. the pom is delicious and the roti is very good, we tried the lamb (massala) and the stewed beef (soja sauce), it was a long time ago that i eat such nice surinam food, even in surinam. very friendly service. love it"
"our first ever taste of surinamese cuisine and it was a lovely surprise. quite spicy and made a nice change from the usual curries we tend to eat. we chose menu c, the chefs selection which gave us a taste of many different dishes. its a nice restaurant, friendly staff and pleasant decor. would love to eat there again."
"the boring snack is out, ken is in! lovely surinam food, and an owner that radiates passion for good food. i used the take-away twice now, and both plates were delicious in taste, and were kept warm nicely. another time we had dinner there. ambiance is not all great, with simple decorations. but then you expect something special from the food. not to worry! special wishes, spicy or plain, it is possible. you can really get a proper surinam meal for a friendly price."
this delightful little restaurant was highly spoken of by the owners of the b&b we were staying at in sneek. a little off the beaten track but with satellite navigation or town map it is not difficult to find and the effort is well rewarded by kens fabulous surinam cuisine. his son is a very friendly guy and speaks excellent english as does ken. the food is delicious and freshly cooked to order. highly recommended.
some might not be impressed by the no-frills interior but its very much the way i like it. i had the veggie roti with pumpkin & eggplant (aubergine) and its absolutely yum 
"if you are in for something different and dont mind a 5 minute walk from the famous sneek landmark de waterpoort in order to get genuine surinam food, which is made with all the love in the world, kens surinam eatcounter is the place you are looking for. all dishes freshly cooked, so they may take some time, but absolutely delicious and the portion size is overwhelming. really genuine surinam kitchen, with all the multi- culti influences incorporated in the dish "

"great place for coffee or lunch. very friendly service, good food, lovely decoration, nicely located."
"very creative sandwich with chicken, bacon, pesto, mayo and curry. hand crafted while you wait. i did take away, but it would have been great for a sit down lunch too."
"by chance we found an excellent coffee-restaurant/bar. they serve an excellent espresso, first class, good on temperatue, and great taste. well done and worthwhile to visit and drink at least one double espresso,"
"the food is good, flexibel sraff, nice and concerned/interested. the price is not too high. good and free parking place"
"we checked into the stayok hostel and came straight here, as it is next door.  the food was good and plentiful, although i would have liked more vegetables with it.  the restaurant has a lovely view, especially in the evening"
"this is the place to be if you are into real chinese cuisine (not westernized) with authentic flavours and combinations. interesting not every-day chinese dishes at very good quality/price ratio. restaurant is situated on the waterfront of the city of sneek, houkesloot, where in summer season you see all types of boats coming from or going to the sneeker meer. wonderful place for chinese dinner."
"since a few weeks, aqua village is working with a new concept, all u can eat sushi and japanese kitchen! this is more than worthy of sharing because the taste, ambiance by the water, caring and attentive waitresses and fresh made sushi is excellent! the presentation, taste and care for food is visible in each dish presented! next to the new japanese kitchen, cantonese and asian kitchen menu is delightful and worth for a visit! a great dinner and worthy for a return with my friends!"
"despite of being alone i had no problem to order a menu which is normally for two. great meal thoroughly enjoyed it. it is a slow eating experience, but definately worth the wait."

"when in sneek and you would like some delicious indonesian food, make sure you visit klein java. various rijsttafel choices. friendly and helpful service. we all loved it."
we enjoyed a jakarta rijsttafel which was amazing! the sheer amount of dishes was surprising and all were very tasty. staff could be slightly more attentive to the needs of the customers as we were ignored a number of times when looking for some more drinks. its recommended to book as this place gets packed!
"we are lovers of indonesian food. the bandung rijsttafel was excellent prepared, nice serving and very tasteful."
it was the first time i ate indonesian food and i liked it. i already knew the thai food but i found just some similarities and especially a reduced use of spic 
we did enjoy a nice and cosy atmosphere with kind personnel and nice food. is a place where for sure i will come back.
"have been coming here for years. so good! the staff is friendly, the food is excellent and the price is good. klein java is officially one of the 50 best indonesian restaurants in the netherlands."
fabulous! my mother-in-law speaks malais with the staff. incredible food!  one of our family favorites!   enak betul!  terimah kasih banjak :-)
having tried the best rated indonesian restaurant in amsterdam and being rather disappointed we decided to try our luck again this time in sneek. a great decisi

"on the way from arnhem to drachten, via boat. food was great, with a great variety of flavour. there was also a great service."
this restaurant has been in this location for many years and well established.  they are proud to use the authentic way of cooking with only fresh and original ingredients.  well advised to pay a visit!

"visited this restaurant with a group of 5 and having lived 10 years in indonesia,i was hoping for authentic flavours. they did not let me down. obviously the spicy dishes were not as spicy as they should be, but i expect that when catering to the general european taste that would be unavoidable. personally i prefer more spice. service was on the slow side, which i actually prefer but if youre in a hurry, this may not be your best choice. i suggest being patient, relax and enjoy. nothing in the indonesian culture is ever fast so this is again authentic  "
"judging from all the good reviews we visited klein java with 3 people. we chose the rice table bandung, with meat and 3 types of satay. it took a while before the dishes came. as a starter were given a small indian loempia: delicious to taste. on the menu is indicated that you should be in a hurry at klein java, because many dishes are freshly prepared and that takes time. the dishes we‚Äôd chosen were great!! tasty seasoned meat, from sweet to spicy and very spicy. delicious gado-gado, the satay-types tasted perfect. highly recommended. very nice is that small java on request serves a bottle of ordinary tap water without costs. in our view, far too little restaurants offer that service. in addition to the delicious food klein java has fair prices: with a drink beforehand and the said rice table for 3 people we paid just over 70 euros. compliments!"
very good food! all ingredients are fresh!! this is worth to visit more than once! personal attention and the best chicken soup ( soto ajam) ever.
"delicious, delicately flavoured dishes. friendly staff. not pricy. the culinary highlight of our visit to friesland."
"we came with six people without reservation and they made it possible that we can sit together. the recommendation was a rice platter which we ordered. they brought 12 different dishes with lamb, chicken, fish and vegetarian. beside this salad, two different kind of rice and before a yummy starter. everyone of us had enough and they even asked to bring more. the food tasted excellent. absolutely recommendable!"
"the only true indonesian restaurant in friesland. superb food, all freshly made, so you have to wait sometimes but it is worth wile. kind and nice service. recommended."
"probably the most affordable restaurant in sneek. you can have dinner a la carte or choose the buffett. a varied choice, even if you are a vegetarian. there is a mix of chinese/indonesian cuisine. the portions were very good, and it was not overpriced, in comparison with others."
"i actually just wanted to post some pictures to give everyone a better impression of the restaurant, but id have to say that i like the food a lot and for me the servings are more than sufficient. if you are in for trying something new or the restaurants best dishes, id definitely recommend you to order one of the specialties or ask the waiter to suggest somethin "
"the all inclusive includes drinks and that includes wine and beer which are usually expensive items. if you drink less than a couple of beers or wines the price per person will seem high, if it‚Äôs a ‚Äòmerry‚Äô evening then it could be great value! good selection of starters and lots of sweet things too, main courses are supplemented by buffet with wok cooked make it up yourself dishes the central item(s). good even impressive decor and friendly service make for a good visit"
"also known as the wok restaurant, the jasmine garden is excellent. a huge choice of dishes already laid out on the buffet or freshly cooked. choose the ingredients... meat, fish or vegetables, take the plateful to the hot grill chef or the stir fry chef and he will cook it there and then, adding sauces of your choice. the ready cooked buffet is nice but the hot grill and stir fry options are better. highly recommended."
"i would recommend this place its very well priced the food is good its not expensive, the is a very good selection of food and drink i would definitely recommend trying this place out wether it be just to relax or have something good to eat, i will try this place again i enjoyed it , it was nice how there was an english menu aswell"
"went to ‚Äòt zusje in apeldoorn. i have visited other locations of ‚Äòt zusje, but never in apeldoorn before. the restaurant looks nice and cozy and the food is as good as in any other ‚Äòt zusje restauran "
we went with 6 of us and we all enjoyed the different dishes. you can order as much as you wa 
very delicious small portions of suprising dishes. nice and helpfull staff. the hard part is what too choice first
"based on the idea of ‚Äòdo not waste food‚Äô, they offer small dishes. therefor you order multiple small dishes for every round. the menu has different and several options and offers good choices. the restaurant people are very friendly and helpfull."
"for my birthday we decided to order in, instead of going out. we paid what you would expect bland got a great choice of foods and sauces and rice. it was all very tasteful and delivered exactly on time. it was many years we at india food and now we remember how much we missed those tremendous tastes!"
"my partner and i visited here with our baby and we had a lovely time. they moved us to a bigger table so we had more room and were very accommodating. delicious food, great vegan options and friendly service. would definitely return if we come back to the area."
"we came on a sunday evening, we enjoyed the ambiance from the inside but outside would have been a great option too. but anyway we had a nice experience. their curries are very good of taste and the fish tikka was very good too. we ordered a buttered chapati with it and the dishes came with a big portion of rice. small portion of pappadums are served as a complimentary starter. service is good but nothing special. the food however is quite close to fabulous. great rich taste, well served on hot-staying plates and big enough. we had to had some courage finishing it all, but we managed. left with a full stomach of indian cuisine."
excellent restaurant  saturday night exceptionally busy one of the best indians i have visited during my 35 years in the netherlands great menu choice friendly staff great value for money classic dishes with a twist

amazing indian food in netherlands.. 
"we had pappadams first with three sauces, one was like chutney,, not sure about the other two. not a good start. samosa was good for entree. mains were excellent. desert also very good for the four chosen. reasonable australian red served with the meal. average prices for great food."
arrived late and were greeted warmly and had excellent and fast service and every need catered to. food was excellent and so was everything else.
"the india palace restaurant is in the centre of apeldoorn and is what i would describe as posh. crisp tablecloths, tall wine glasses on the table draped with napkins, that sort of thin "
what impressed me the most is that the complaint of a guest (mine) was taken serious. a business that listens to its customers is one that will succee 
"i have been there as an solo traveler and with my non-indian office colleagues. all the time , the experience has been truly awesome . very good food- as close to having something in india. , nicely packed for the to go orders. everyone should absolutely be to this restaurant to experience it .!"
this is a best place for authentic indian food at genuine price with so much of variety. a must visit for everyone.
"i have tried almost every dish at india palace. if you ask me which one is my favorite, ill say, every dish. they have the best collection of indian curries. ive always enjoyed having meal at this place, especially their special india palace thali. and yes, dont forget to try their mango lassi and mango liqu "
"india palace has truly been my home abroad serving the finest indian cuisine.. i am so very fond of their chicken madras, biriyani and dal tadka. and will certainly recommend this place to anyone who wants to give the best to their tastebuds. i have taken several of my dutch friends to this place and theyve been suggesting that we visit over again !!"
i have been there in apeldoorn for a month and almost daily visited to india place restaurant. i have never felt like i am out of india. they are nice people and so food. whether you are indian or not you should try their food once.
"real good food, really nice service. we had a splendid meal, quick and more then enough.  great place to be. not very big but a nice location in center of town.  we will come back!"
good selection of traditional curry dishes. cater well if youre looking for something with some good spice like is served in the uk. accurate and fast service.
great service and food was first class. prices are reasonable and portions are good. nice selection of beers and i would definitely return.
"food was very good (dal soup and vegetarian dishes). also special beer availible . friendly service. not very cheap, but also not very expensive."
last day was very remarkable day for ate  delicious food with my friends at india place restaurant. specially india place special menu and vegetarian food. this food was very testy.they provide good hospitality and fast service. its really very testy food.                  recommended
"the owner moved from a small location to this one wich is much bigger, serving good food. friendly staff."
"great food & drinks. lovely place in the center of apeldoorn. stylish interior with committed and friendly staff. my go to place for lunch or, later on the day, a glass of great wine from their excellent collection."
we just passed this small lunchroom and it looked so inviting. the service is perfect and of course also their coffee and sandwiches. the owner explained very well about the different tastes of the coffeebeans. next time well stop there again.
the owner of rembrandt is very friendly and knows what he is talking about. this place is perfect for a simple lunch or having some drinks in the afternoon (they have great wines).
"tapas as much as you can eat for a fixed price, with a lovely mochito and nice cuban music, what more can you want! meat, fish, vegan, cold tapas, i will be back for sure."
"we, a friend of mine and myself, went to la cubanita on a sunday evening to try out the restaurant for the first time. it was very busy and we were glad that we reserved a table upfron "
"on a recent business trip, we struggled to find an open restaurant so came across la cubanita by accident. thank goodness! what a really nice experien "
"went here many times with friends and always recommend this place. if you like latin cuban style music and feeling, you are def in the right place. its very cozy and cute, great vibe and the food is good. too bad the all you can eat tapas is not in the weekend, but over all great! lots of choice in tapas and everything tastes good! always very busy, so youll have to make reservations."
we had dinner in la cubanita apeldoorn for the first time and we were satisfied. the tapas are good and the atmosphere is great: its a colourful place with matching music. the staff is attentive and friendly. one major point though is that the toilets were very dirty and are obviously not regularly cleaned. 
"as soon as you enter this restaurant you see the -of course- cuban influence; photos of cuban street life, che guevara and so... its fun that as a guest you are allowed to write messages on the wall "

"very good food, amazing athmosphere. owners all the time talking care about guests. nice wine, so delicious starter and main course."
"poppe is an excellent restaurant. it can get quite busy, so best to reserve. the menu is good, although for vegetarians and people who dont enjoy uncooked meant/fish the choice is not extensive. the food is really lovely and well presented. the service is friendly and attentive. there is an excellent selection of wines if you are prepared to pay for it. there is (limited) parking behind the restaurant and a nice garden when the weather is suitable for al fresco dining. its also very good for lunch as well as dinner."
a great place with excellent food and great service. with the surprise menu definitely the pace to go
"i ordered the tuna dish as my starter. it was serve thinly cut with a asian soy sauce base. while the sauce was a perfect companion of the tuna as it did not overpower the delicate taste of it. for my main entree ordered the sea bass in a tomato base sauce with a basil aioli. fish was perfectly cook, moist and tender, sauces complemented well the delicate flavor of the fish. for dessert i ordered the chocolate dessert with ice cream, nothing out of the ordinary, maybe i was expecting more after having the tuna and sea bass."
"i use to dinner several times a year with different friends at poppe. this is in part to due the geographical location of apeldoorn as each of us comes from another part of the country, but this is mainly due to the good kitchen and fine wines, the friendly staff and the pleasant atmosphere. after an interesting lecture in the nearby synagogue there, this time i came with my wife. as usual, we had an enjoyable evening."
"we had the 3course set menu which was a delight. the staff very fery attentive. they accomodate our request to start outside then move inside. if i lived in apeldoorn, we would be regulars."
"upon entering , you look right into the kitchen of restaurant poppe . although we were early for lunch , there were already four chefs busy to prepare fresh fo "
"it was only by chance that we came across poppe for lunch and what a delightful venue this really is. we had a lovely set 3 course meal which was superb value for 25 euros. the service was relaxed & unrushed, which is a rarity in this day and age. our waitress was lovely & helpful and even explained all of the courses (in english) in detail to me. the complimentary bread & olives were a real nice touch. the place itself has a nice cosy atmosphere and the rest rooms are modern & clean. highly recommended indeed."
"our plan was to have dinner next door at martins, but after being seated and then ignored for 10 mins we left and went next door. a very good decision. we were quickly given a table and our drinks order was taken. when the waiter realised that i was not dutch he switched to english and bought me an english menu. the food was excellent. i ordered the goats cheese with mango chutney and the salmon in puff pastry with a lemon grass sauce both delicious. my only complaint is that there was not enough of the lemongrass sauce, but that is a small complaint as the salmon was beautifully moist and delicious on its own. my husband ordered the oysters and then the sole, both were very tasty and cooked to perfecti "
"never been to a vietnamese restaurant, but this buffet restaurant offers lovely vietnamese dishes, specialities from the grill and great service aswe "
"friendly reception, traditional food, though, it is adapted to local taste. if you know how to find your way, you ignore the buffet and go to the (lady-)staffed kitchen in the right-back corner. light, fresh and sizzeling."
went here with family who had been before and really enjoyed the food there. ate a variety of dishes and there wasnt anything i did not like from the main foods available. i did not try everything though so i have a reason to go back and eat there again. 
"we had dinner with friends here. before dinner we played dutch billiards and had a drink. people are extremely kind and helpful. we decided to stay for dinner which was good. nothing fancy, but is is a bar, right? excellent place for a drink and a bite after hiking in the surrounding area! "
at cafe de hamer you can enjoy your drinks and meal at the large terrace. they do not make reservations and it is always busy but you dont have to wait too long for a table. very friendly staff and good food.
"situated near royal palace on the way to vaassen, you will find this very local meeting point to have a drink or a pub meal. in summer time with possibility to sit outside in the garden."
"this local cafe just outside apeldoorn is not cozy, its not comfortable, its just gezellig. :) this is typically dutch word. it describes a mood, a feeling. just go and found out yoursel "
"we went here around dinner time on a friday night. the place was packed to the roof. all sorts of different types mingling which i found very interesting. many just come for a drink, and others eat. tables are hard to get, so you have to be lucky. the food is generous and of good quality but i wouldnt call it fine dining...it is more bar/bistro kind of fare. the kitchen closes early, i thought around 9 or so, so dont be late. service was very friendly despite it being so busy. overall, a fun place to go, watch people and enjoy the crowd."
"we are in town for a couple of weeks and our hotel does not have suites with kitchens so we are eating out much more than we prefer. that being said, we found cafe de hamer last night and we were very impressed!! i had the chicken salad and it was one of the best salads i have had in a very long time!! we will be going back to try more items tonight. another great thing is it is open all day. we had a busy morning so didnt make it there until 3pm and there was no break in the kitchen staff. we were served as soon as we walked in."
"i walked by this place a few times , decided to go in and give it a try , i liked the menu selection especially the wine list , the location is so good as well, sat out side as it was warm , id recommend the steak tartar i enjoyed that the most with red wine üç∑ "

i had eaten at martins some time ago and was pleasantly surprised how much it has improved. the menu was rather carnivore-centric but there are now vegetarian and vegan dishes on the menu. what pleased me the most is the excellent selection of wines; actually there are very nice wines available for a very reasonable pri 
was not the first time that we visited martins we were lucky enough to eat from the renewed menu which included a tuna specialty that well cooked that exceeded expectations.
"ever since i can remember, martins is an icon in apeldoorn. lunch, dinner, brunch, high tea or high wine... they keep re-inventing themselves and always serve quality food. you can be sure theres always plenty of food on your plate, whatever dish you choose. superb wine choice, even by the glass. good ambiance, nice people."
"on several occasions my friend and i ate at martins before we seeing a movie. martins is situated at the hart of apeldoorn, the shops, the cinema and the theatre are a few minutes walking distance. the staff is young and friendly and the food is great."
martins brasserie is a nice place in the center of apeldoorn .with in summer a terras in the front off the building and one in the garden at the back. the food and wines are well chosen .and the card is easy to chose from.
"i have had lunch and dinner here on several occasions and it was always good, although i prefer having lunch here. they have enough things to choose from, although the 12-uurtje is my favorite. its a plate with a small glass of fresh tomato soup, a mini-bread with egg-salad and a breadroll with kroket (typical dutch). they have an awesome fresh mint-tea with honey. i took my handicapped mom there for lunch on my birthday and even though we had to ask several people to move, we could get in with her wheelchai "
i had a simple lunch with a friend in this brasserie in the center of apeldoorn. the food is good and well prepared.

"potjandorie in the north part of apeldoorn (walking distance from palace t loo) offers a wide variety of entries (eur 7,50) and mains (eur 20,50). the mains are stoves with meat (chicken, pork, beef, fish) and some vegetarian offerings. additional they offer a free amuse and some bread. also a salad from the salad bar is included. salads are well tasty. the service is ok. quality of the food is good, however the pork (varkenshaas) was leathery, unfortunately. hot served which is perfect. it took quite a long time before getting the food, so dont go for a quick meal. a restaurant worth a visit."
superleckeres essen... we recommend the gezonde pot quinoa and the spareribs... very friendly staff. cosy little restaurant.
"very well situated at the beginning of the park and close to things like the apenheul this is a nice place to sit and eat something, especially on a nice day when you can sit out on the deck overlooking the park."
food was excellent! the ambiance perfect!  the is an outdoor patio overlooking the lake with a huge fountain! just beautiful!
family dinner.  food and service was great.  3 course dinner was really enjoyable. great setting as well.
"the food is great and the prices are pretty good. chef dirk knows his stuff!  great atmosphere! also for meetings and weddings, the location is amazing!!"
"this brent new restaurant is situated near a beautifull pont and a lovely nature park. you can take nice walks in the park or just sit and relax. nearby there is also a zoo, called apenheul. there you can walk among all kind of free roming monkeys."
"this is a great place to sit outside for food and drink when the weather is nice. the terrace has a lovely view over a lake. the food is pretty good, although we tend to prefer it for lunch or snacks."
"we had a quick lunch outside on the terrace overlooking the large fishpond. the service was friendly, the food was good, offering vegetarian options."
this restaurant is situated in a beautiful park with a wonderful pond. after a walk it is good to a break for a drink and a meal. nice and professional service staff. quality of food is good.
"we arrived in apeldoorn to visit family and went for a walk around the park, stopping at the restaurant for lunch. it was a damp day and the restaurant was very inviting. the food was both good and plentiful and everyone enjoyed their meal in a warm and friendly environme "
"nice locaion with good view over the area outside, inside and from the terrace at good weather. combination with meeting rooms offers good possibilities for pleasant group meetings in a relaxed atmosphere"
pleasant location on the lake before or after visiting apenheul.  basic food and drink.  seating is in or outdoors - best outside if you can.
"me and my so had a very nice dinner in this restaurant. the layout of the restaurant is spacious, almost too spacious. if you want to have a private conversation, this is the place to go. the view from the dining area on the big pond of the park is very beautiful. it would be nice if the lights were on in the evening. during summer evenings it must be very nice to sit and eat outside on the terrac "
"you must go. in a small pretty netherlands town. a great local feel. part pub, part restaurant. tucked away. staff great and very helpful. food out of this world and served hot - temperature. beer selection great. local dutch people friendly. decor and atmosphere brilliant. great value. thanks for all there. hope to pop by again "
this small bar - restaurant has seatings in the back. its not a big place but more pub style if you like. the atmosphere is easy going and a lot of locals get to this place to have a drink or relax and some even after work to shoot some pool with beer and snac

really awesome dinner experience. well worth the time and expense and in a beautiful setting.  it is gourment food.
"we had a marvelous experience with the 6 course menu of the season. everything was beautifully served and everything tasted great. special compliments for the creative dishes such as the yellowfin kingfish sashimi ensemble. a wonderful wine pairing, a beautiful ambiance and outstanding service made it a perfect experience."
"my husband and i spent 5 days in the hotel and decided to try their gastronomic restaurant, we really enjoyed the experience! because when we go to this kind of restaurant, each time it is a different ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, one has to be aware that it needs a bit a patience because the dishes are extremely refined, require time and skills to get prepared, what is more the waiting is really nice since the atmosphere, the amuse-bouches, the service make it perfe "
"many years ago i visited this place on the occasion of an anniversary meal with my grandmother. the place burnt down , hence a brand new hotel annex restaurant. the welcome was exemplary attentive and energetic. the modern building runs the risk that you lose some authenticity but service makes it up. the diner we had was fine, but not exceptional. true they had pigeon, deer and all nature offers, which was good but not world-class. the room (well suite) was really superb. the shower (one tab 2 waterjets ) was great. this is a really fine place to stay. breakfast is average, but good. all in all, nice place, and you will feel welcome here"
"i could go into detail, but i think its enough to say that this food compares with all of my michelin star experiences. truly gastronomy the fact that game is the feature on the menu only adds greater attraction to my tastes; however, my wife was absolutely thrilled by the fish of the evening and the vegetables. the meal itself was underlined with fresh ingredients and spirits of tastes that challenged your palate but never overwhelmed. dishes would contain both elements that were both cool to the mouth and next to it something perfectly warmed and in between would be a foam or a glaze that would bring both elements together. what im trying to say is that a meal here is an experience and it will not disappoint. the wine list is extensive and has many reasonable finds with a lien toward french varietals. the thought of a pre-drink or an afgter-dinner drink is easily met with a deep bar, including a variety of regional beers. im not necessarily a beer drinker, but when in rome...the pair that i had were unique and delicious. and if anyone has a taste for bubbles, they serve veuve clicquot by the glass (and bottle) in the black topped bottle. delicious and reasonable. i cant wait to come back to explore the menu further."
"in the middle of the green woods of dutch nature area ‚Äòde veluwe‚Äô, the intimate hotel de echoput is located. we were given the opportunity to experience this hotel by having a very well-organized stay here while getting to utilize the facilities of this place such as the (grand) fitness area, the swimming pool and sauna. thanks to the calming environment, the great facilities and the attentive and hardworking personnel, we had an amazing stay at hotel de echop "
"my husband and i were spending the weekend exploring around arnhem and the veluwe, so it was somewhat of a last minute idea to enjoy lunch here (booking a table after we had already left home). consequently we felt a bit underdressed but we were still made to feel very welcome. the food was delicious and showed how good ingredients can be combined in amazing ways that really excited the palate. the learning came from the excellent wine pairing - i wouldn‚Äôt usually have a white wine with lamb but it was excellent. dessert was lovely, although it was a shame that the souffl√© was not available. this is not a restaurant that just churns out food though, so occasional sellouts are to be expected. we will definitely try to come back for an evening meal and maybe an overnight stay..."
"situated in the forest, this hotel is the perfect get a way from the city. during our stay we have encountered very friendly and well trained staff. the high level of service has made our stay very comfortable. the 5 course diner that was served was very tasty, even though a sauce was missing at one of the plates, the service team corrected this flawlessly. definitely recommend to stay there!"
"booked table for two at 19.30. the first and the second menu was excellent. the main course was served at 22.00 which is rather late. i could not enjoy my dish anymore because i was starving. when it comes to the dessert, i was not in the mood anymore because i want it to end. it is pity that first excellent impression is ruined by lack of time managemen "
"we had a tasting of wines like hermitage and less. after we had a lunch, very good!!!! in the evening wild eating in the brasserie, all right"
"very good restaurant (and hotel). we had an excellent 3 course-menu. rather small but delicious portions, overall quit enough for a good meal that was definitely worth the price. the service was extremely friendly and informative without being pushy. only (but quit annoying) remark was the horrible timing as we spent almost 4 hours for 3 courses. the planning took way too long to be acceptable, if not for that this would have been one of our top-5 restaurant experiences of thus year (but still top 10!)"
"last year we spent one evening at restaurant de echoput and the experience was so good that we wanted to explore this gastronomic temple more extensively.so we booked a 4-days 5-courses gastronomic arrangement. we had not a single major disappointment and in those four days every course was new, a performance ! on top of that the restaurant and the staff offer a rarechic friendly, polite and efficient servi "

"we visited the restaurant of hotel de echoput on a sunny,warm evening after booking online. upon arrival we were met by a distinguished young lady who was already informed about our horror for garlic. she escorted us to a nicely set table outside and proposed the surprise menu. the surprise was not very big as it was almost completely the proposed evening menu. nevertheless the courses were of outstanding quality and intriguing. a special visual effect of serving vegetables in a charcoaled cabbage on live charcoal was nice and fortunately the game served was as nice as the frills.the show part reminded me of el bulli.i had to drive 20 miles back to our hotel and intoxicated driving is not in my ethics. the young lady -i would not be doing justice calling her a waitress- proposed a small half glass of pairing wine,something i have not experienced elsewhere. in conclusion: the menu is very close to a michelin star if not above. reception and table service were flawless and the price was not that much above the normal eatery. adjacent to the restaurant one will find a small shop with local delicacies, cigars and win "

"me and my girlfriend stayed at the keizerskroon which king street restaurant is part of. it was a great ambiance in a luxury setting. we arrived late, around 9, but the waitress was still friendly and was happy to serve us a 4 course dinner even when the regular closing time of the kitchen was 9:30 pm. the food was really delicious, full of flavour, great texture and well plated. the wine served was very well. some of the were more complimentary to the dishes than others. overall, a great experience. well worth your bucks even though its on the finer end of dining."
the staff were amazing! they reassured me when i requested a gluten free option to the 2 course set menu and were so polite and friendly. i really felt welcome in a country that i have never been to before. the food was excellent and the decor extravagant. i really enjoyed dining here and will be back every night during my stay!
we dined at the restaurant during our stay at the bilderberg hotel. we ordered the set menus and were pleasantly surprised with the presentation and taste of the food that came out of the kitchen and overall friendliness of the staff. the sets were a combination of meat and seafood dishes garnished with the quality local produce. delicious.
nicely cooked fish and meat dishes. good wine. service was friendly and the waitress was experienced and professional. the waiter smelled like cigarette smoke following his break. overall the restaurant was a bit expensive but tasty. 
"great food, especially the meats on the grill. friendly service. some tables are too close to each other."
good restaurant which was in the hotel where we stayed. the only downside was the fact that we had a couple next to us who was really listening to us almost all evening. if the tables would have been a little further apart (or if we would have had different neighbours) it would have been perfect. the 4 out of 5 score is not affected by this.

"we went to dinner here after the uci world track cycling and it was lovely. service was very attentive and the food beautifully presented and delicious. the prices are higher than normal so not an everyday experience, but a treat. when we were there it was quiet. the decor is modern and has a feeling of luxury about it. i would not suggest children go there as i have no idea if they could accommodate them, but it seems more an adult experience."

"we ate at king street restaurant last night with my european team. anouk, a young student took care of our table and it was a real treat. i rarely saw someone who had so much fun doing his job but above all, doing everything for his clients to have an excellent evening. the beautiful story of the evening was that in my team, there are english, italians, russians and french people. at the end of the evening, anouck took the time to write us a small postcard telling us that she had also had a good evening taking care of our table, in the different languages spoken by my team. it was super cool !!! i wish anouk the best for his future care "
"very good restaurant as for hotel standards. good choice of top fresh modern food, nice wine choice and excelnt service"
surprisingly for a hotel restaurant a good combination of quality and service. mains are either from the grill or slow cooked. setting is quite intimate. if you are staying in the hotel  an easy and tasty choice.
"the restaurant deserves the michelin star that owns. i can honestly say that it is one of the best restaurants in netherlands. the taste is so delicate and innovative that make the restaurant unique. we have had a delicious duck terrine, a crab soup and the most amazing pork wangs that i have ever tasted. "
"food is excellent, staff is extremely friendly, rooms are big, but a little bit dated. stayed for two nights. breakfast is very good. will visit again for sure."
excellent fish and dessert. nice service and good quality wines. especially sparkling wine was good. good value for money
"excellent meal, food was well presented, cooked perfectly and served with a smile. they offer a three course menu ( you choose your courses from the menu) servings are generous and tasty, the chef has an assured hand in cooking. we walked away very pleased and delighted to have dined in the hotel that evening."
"love the food here. its the best place to treat yourself. the food is tasty and staff is pretty good. great atmosphere. not to be over looked as what else you would look for going to a restaurant, amazing food and great service."

"i went here for dinner , the food selection is good portions are generous and nice the price for the food and wine is very well worth the price , i went for the all u can eat i didnt run out of options and there was no time limit the food was very tasty too, i would recommend this place if u wanna enjoy some wine and flavourful food."
"we had a groupon voucher for this restaurant, so we booked  "
when you are a lover of spanish food then is this ramblas the most suitable place in apeldoorn. we took all kinds of cold and warm tapas and the quality was delicious. you also can choose for other food.

"we came with 8 kids , all found something to eat. the kids played until the food arrived. the food was tasty!!!"
"we had four different pizzas, each was delicious - basic and tasty, just the way a pizza should be. the kids loved their kids meal, even fries with ribs was an option. in short: great affordable place for a family meal."
"simple dishes but very testy and with very friendly atmospher. children can play till you wait for your portions and let you relax and rest after the trip.  they have discounted menus for children and regular including soup, mean course and dessert."
"we have come back many times, and each time we enjoy the atmosphere and the ordered food. service is very friendly and rather quick. the variety plentiful."
the location of this b&b is perfectly close to the center and close to the station. there is a bus stop right in front of the doo 
"we shared breakfast with our dutch family on our first morning in apeldoorn. we had a great spread with breads, conserves, coffee and egg. very reasonably priced."
this is a b&b located across the street from the central square. the central train station and the main shopping streets are an easy walk. palace het loo is a 20 minute bus ride and the kroller muller museum is a 35 minute bus ride away. the location is perfect - as is the large and comfortable rooms. the breakfast is five star quality. this is as good as a b&b can get!
a dutch flat pancake house.  big variety of savory and sweet monster crepes. just toooo delicious. glad we decided to stop driving by.  cousy atmosphere and family oriented.
a big surprise to find such a lovely place nearby at apeldoorn. also the pancakes. real professional piece of work. demands to go back !!!
this restaurant is on the main street from the a50 to the city -centre. from outside it looks very old but nice. the inside is very historic too. you have instantly the feeling to be ho 
"this a great place frequented by locals. you can get a menu in  english and the staff is very friendly and helpful. i had three in the pan which had bacon, cheese and apples. great dinner in apeldoorn!"
"went with some family upon the recommendation of some other family members and i was not disappointed. i had a pancake with bacon, cheese, goats cheese, pine nuts and honey and it was delicious. i could have happily eaten it again straight after."
we stopped at this restaurant during a visit to holla 
"after the apenheul we went to this pancake place. it is housed in a modern building on the edge of the center.. with a lot of parking places close by. the nice thing about this restaurant is that inside they have a lot of old attributes, it gives the pancake place a nice atmosphere and of course my grandchildren loved the pancakes and poffertjes. "
we love to eat pancakes and this restaurant is our favourite place for pancakes in apeldoor 
"went there because it was next to our hotel, what a nice surprise. the oysters were delicious, the ‚Äú quenelle de cabillaud ‚Äú too. the dry white wine advised matched marvelously and the coffee with treats was just fabulous and tasty. i would definitely recommend this restaurant , great food, great staff, great ambiance."
this year we decided to have our family christmas dinner with my 86 year old mother at de bon vivant in apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in an old house and has a lovely atmosphere. the serving staff were friendly and made sure that we were served in a timely manor. we went for the 5 course christmas dinner which was prepared very well.
"a very good kitchen and very sympathic personal, i had a coq au vin and  amour du chocolat, it was perfect."
"spend an evening here with some collegues, excellent food and friendly service. next to the theatre in case youre looking for  a pre theatre dinner"
this atmospheric restaurant is probably one of our answers if we want to have a nice dinner out. the place has two separated rooms where you can eat or go on stage where you have a nive overview over the restaura 
the service at this restaurant is excellent.  we had the set menu and all courses were delicious.  the food is mainly european. our table was outside which was very pleasant in the warm weather.
"we went not knowing anything about the restaurant and the food was gorgeous, service exemplary leisurely but not slow.  the bill was expensive but not outrageous and would definitely recommend.  no good for children as the flavours are more ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù."
we had a dinner at de bon vivant and that was really culinair experience. i ordered duck meat under the wine sauce and my wife took risotto. the dishes were excellently prepare

"a very nice place to sit, relax and enjoy a great meal after visiting many a tourist attraction. a great spot for a great meal"
"i ate here twice, and both time enjoyed the food and the setting. food was very good, but the vegetarian options were limited."
"this is not a fine dining restaurant, but the food is always good and the service very friendly. the wine selection is above average and when in season, their wild game is amazing (deer, wild pig and hare)."
there arent many dutch restaurants that know how to cook or even have a concept of good customer service. this restaurant is one of those rare exceptions. excellence through and through.
"i have been to this restaurant a couple of times over the last few years. every time both service and the food have been excellent. during the asparagus season they prepare many different and tasty dishes based on this. the athmosphere is nice and in my opinion, value for money is very good."
"very nice and cozy restaurant with all the atmosphere that is required to get a taste of this nice region in the center of the netherlands de veluwe. particularly the velwse schavuyt, the local beer, was very nice. try to pronounce schuimkraag and if you succeed, you will be recognised as a real dutch scoundrel."
"if youre looking for a wonderful french style restaurant, youll not go wrong here. this was my second visit (my first in 2014) and it was really good (again). the waitress this time (not sure her name) was so helpful and had a fantastic sense of humour. she just added to the excellent food so i cannot recommend the de bon vivant enough. if youre staying at the bastion het loo hotel, this restaurant is only ten minutes walk along the road towards apeldoorn town centre. you van miss it!"
the fish and the side dishes were divine. the wine was perfect. the athmosphere was really relaxing. the staff was always smiling. the deserts were presented in an elegant way
"good food, inexperienced / friendly staff, good wines (especially the chardonnay of latour. cosy environment."
"we did visit this place last summer, and it was do or die for my wife, she had some experiences that it was not what se expected from a fine dine. last time the food was simply awesome and for sure will come back. they do also seasonal themes which are great!"
"excellent little bistro on the outskirts of town. we had the set menu. 3 courses all delicious, smoked salmon, rib eye and ice cream dessert. what was level was the service, attentive, though not imposing, charming and helpfu "
we enjoyed our first evening of our short break at this restaurant in apeldoorn. we saw people enjoying their wines and massive portions of mussels. joining them was a fantastic idea. while sitting outside at the warmed terrace we felt welcomed by the pleasant waiters. food was great! dont know about others but we experienced a lovely late summer eve at bon vivant. righteous name for this place!
"a very relaxing and friendly restaurant with excellent service, fine food and a smile. we enjoyed duck breast, the chocolate trio and an ice cream treat for my partner. run and owned by a local couple, there are trappings of the hunter and much evidence of the local area and its proximity to the palace het loo."
restaurant de bon vivant is located near the palace het loo along a beautiful road. and you can park right in front of the restaurant for fr 
"this was a wonderful treat in apeldoorn! the service was great, the waiters were very friendly and informative. furthermore, the food was so good, i couldnt believe what nice food we got for the good price. i would definitely recommend anyone going there!!"
"very friendly waiters and good food. big portions (too big for us), and helpful and very friendly waiters, although we showed up after a ballet show in the theatre"
"when to this place for dover sole and muscles  with beer , was a really good experience i enjoyed how there was a nice selection as well as the friendly service , i would recommend giving this place a visit üòÄ"
"we took good friends out to eat here, we were here before and knew a bit what was coming up, the food they serve is really great, fresh and tastefull, the crew is very nice and helpfull, the atmosphere is nice and cozy, the have a little outside sitting area, the deserts are awesome :) one little downer for me were the mens restrooms, they could use an update, they were clean, but very old."
"we have been here several times, because the service is excellent. the owner and his wife are very friendly to the guests. again the restaurant was fully occupied. every guest becomes a delicious appetizer for free. the menu is adapted to the season. for example in september you can eat a special dutch delicacy, namely: mussels!! in the autumn: loin of venis "
"i really enjoyed having dinner, the quality of the food is good but the service is the best. the owners are very friendly and always trying to make you feel at home."
this restaurant is located in the centre of apeldoorn. mostly and specifically on the weekends you have to book a table (telephone: +31 55 521 314 
the owner was so very warm and inviting to our three generation family during a visit on easter sunda 
"amazing food! absolutely loved the staff and food. fantastic decor in the establishment. i call this place the poffertjes museum, as they allowed me and my girlfriend the experience of trying to make poffertjes. an absolute joy! great for kids, and tasty traditional dutch pancakes"
we ordered rijsttafel for 15 and what came was fantastic. wonderful mixture of foods all delivered free of charge including heated serving trays. absolutely wonderful and made our large family celebration very easy. thanks
very nice and authentic indonesian restaurant. the owner was very friendly and recommended us a good combination of food. i will definitely eat at this place again if i am visiting apeldoorn
"nice restaurant delicious food friendly and welcoming services, mostly recommended if you want to try indonesian food taste or if you miss indonesian food. no complain!"
"i have been here yesterday with my niece and her friends from wageningen university. we ordered soto and the others nasi rames served with nasi kuning , rendang, semor and indonesian pickles (acar) and some snacks. i have been to many indonesian restoran in holland before and i can tell you this is the best i have ever been, all food was very tasty especially soto ayam ! this recepie you can only get in indonesia! my niece and her friends atmitted it too. in no time we devoured all food served "
"the food is great. the service is friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. we ordered tapas for 10 and pointed out that one of our party was vegetarian. the staff made sure that they were catered for. on the whole, a wonderful experience."
we went for a sunday afternoon ride on the bike and landed here.  surprised: nice and comfortable setting. some holiday lightning. good background music. and cute little dog.
"just a quick stopover for lunch, good food, fast and friendly service. the restaurant is located at the edge of a glider plane field a real nice scenery. we drove past on sunday and saw many gliders up in the air, looking for thermals for their planes to climb. today being monade it was quiet and not that many guests nor glider planes."
"me and my husband have visited thuis place multiple times and it is still the best place to have some ramen in holland. the soup with chicken and calpis (drink) is great. gyoza is always good there. the owner actually is interested in how you perceive the food and if the level of spicyness is spicy enough for you. if not, he will make some changes for you. we even tried some other places like ramen ya but the broth of ramen ya was not as good as set. the quality for the price you receive is excellent. there isnot a lot of options on the menu but the soup and appetizers om the menu are great ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"this has become one of our go-to places. the food is exceptionally fresh, always good and full of flavor. the prices are good and the service attentive. we like the intimate atmosphere. a great option alone or with a small group."
"while trying to think of a place to dine after a long trip, my friends and i decided to give this place a try. one of us is a local the "
"i read a couple of reviews on here, and i was very surprised to read other people‚Äôs experiences in set for wish arnhem. my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for years now, and we have loved it ever since our first visit "
"i come often in set for wish. the interior is very simple but the food is delicious. they serve typical japanese style noodlesoups and don with rise. there are varities with chicken, beef, seafood and vegetarian. you can choose the hot-level but beware: the vulcano and higher are very hot. they use naga jolokia and reaper peppers for it. one of the hottetst peppers in the world."
noodle soup is made fresh with fresh ingredients. i recommend the king miso udon and the dumplings. japanese soda is also nice.
"whenever i went to a japanese place that was cheap. but this was an exception. the place is very small and nothing to brag about the ambience. but it is in the centre of the city and provides very nice food in good portion for a reasonable price. so, we loved it. want to go back there again."
"popped in for a business lunch and i was very much impressed. very good food. friendly service. nice terrace. and from what‚Äôs i could see, the interiors of the restaurant looked very good too."
we had booked a table and were seated quickly even though it was very busy. we were advised on the wines for sale and our order was taken quickly and professionally. the food was excellent although the card was a bit confusing as it was not clear if the food was served with sauce and vegetables. they were mentioned separately on the menu and were not included with the meal. ordering a full meal one does expect a matching sauce to be part of the meal.
we loved the burgers and the service was friendly. a excellent restaurant for a good quick meal.  they have a good selection of hamburgers and other similar meals. we love going to the beer franchise restaurant all of them are good!
friendly staff and good service. the food us affordable and has large  portions. close to the cinema where we went after. love the ribs and their sandwiches! great recommendation and very affordable.
we were headed for the italian but they were queuing up the street so we turned into this little gem of a restaurant. service was very good and friendly. good choice of beer and great choice of food. waitress was very understanding as our and her first language was not english. we sat outside and was great with good heating even in the thunderstorm. highly recommended restaurant would definitely go back. 
"went here on a monday to have unlimited spareribs. service was quick at first but after our first round, we hardly had any service. it took forever to get drinks later on too. spareribs come with fries and salad (once) and are very tasty!! ketjap was my favorite, although i didnt try all of them."
"new nice restaurant next to arnhem station. we went here for a quick bit just before the cinema. the food was good and more than enough, service was quick and waiter was friendly. was quite busy so might need reservations?"
"first time visitor, nice restaurant and location is close to hotels and train station. very good food although service was a bit slow on drinks. happy overall though and would visit again."
i was told that this was a new restaurant and that i had to go there with my teens to have a nice experience. indeed it was. we took the unlimited spare ribs option which is available on thursdays and if i m correct also on mondays. the ribs and the chips were excellent.
we were early for lunch so it was quiet inside. great quick service and good suggestions for options. food tasted amazing!
"excellent for gluten free.  separate prep and excellent gf bagels.  definitely recommend! if you have celiac disease, dont worry - they know what they are doing!"
"i had a delicious bagel with loads of avocado a few other veggies, and chive cream cheese.  really tasty and only 5.50 euros.  good price for wonderful food.  although the restaurant was crowded, service was quick."
see above. everything they have is good but i do take detours for their cappuccino. i can also recommend the dadeltaart.  not much to do for children except for drawings.
"their large capuchino is the best to give you that pep in your step, food is organic and the classical playlist theyve got is so soothin "
love bagel & beans and been to many of it. like other b&b this one is bigger so have more space. service was good and food was delicious. the only thing i dislike in ever b&b is why are serving plates to small ?!
"i have been to many bagels & beans now, delicious every time! i personally think the iced coffee here is the best ive ever had. the service is really good, and a perfect location too if youre shopping for the day in arnh "
i have been here a couple of times and i love it. everything is organic and fresh. the sandwiches look small but it will be enough to make you full. the different combinations of sandwiches are odd and different from another restaurants but really tasty. this is an special place that you will love or you will hate. the coffee is perfect and the tea really special. i will not recommend the smoothies. it has high prices.
"located in the heart of the old city, this is a good vegetarian friendly restaurant. i ordered the tuna-cheese melt, which was quite good. note that it is only open until about 5:00 p.m. so it is mainly a breakfast-lunch place."
"bagels & beans is a shop with wide variety of bagels and decoration, but yet keeps its very own style. rustique and yet provocative, conservative and stimulating."
"place isnt too large, so i suggest to make a reservation.  very quaint spot that serves really good food!  place was busy when we went.  prices are very reasonable and service was speedy!"
"delicious! the waiter was very kind. the food was served fast and it was really good.  i can recommend this place to anyone with a budget. if im in arnheim again, i will come back!   thank you."
"we get food from this little gem every week for the past 3 years now. the food is delicious and authentic. the service is great. cant wait for the next visit. i recommend everything from the menu, but my favourite is the thai streetfood noodle soup."
amazing food! such big portions and so well priced!!! the waitresses are so fun & friendly & the atmosphere is really happy
"authentic and tasty food with lovely service. all around a great experience, would highly recommend!"
price ans quality of the food is good. i like the home made ice tea. pork and duxk with noodle is the best! we have enjoyed our lunch over there.
clean open kitchen where you can see how the food is prepar 
"i‚Äôm not completely sure if i want to share this one with you. it‚Äôs so good, i want to make sure it will remain here snd as good as it was today. found this restaurant per accident, and a very happy accident it was! it‚Äôs only small and doesn‚Äôt have a high-end decoration, but the friendliness of the staff and above that the quality of food was nothing short of fantast "
"finding proper chinese food in arnhem at reasonable prices is a struggle. tried this place and was pleasantly surprised - good portions, friendly service, reasonably priced and tasted. nothing fancy, just a nice quick meal!"
"after the opening, we tried this place. now we visit this hidden gem weekly. its like we are in asia, so friendly and fresh cooking with love. for max 10‚Ç¨ the best beef noodle, thai wok, beef curry, chicken vegetables, soupsüòÄ"
one of the best sandwiches i ever had! cosy authentic relaxed atmosphere. italian size coffee sandwich bar. superbe coffee and helpful friendly staff. must go place
"nice little place serving toasties. what can you do with one of these. isnt it just cheese and ham? well, even if it is, they come on very nice wholemeal bread and great melted chee "
"have been coming to this restaurant since they opende basically and since it has been my go to restaurant. with friends, family or even alone. always great food and surprising combinations. never had a bad dish here. also the wine paring is absolutly stand out."
"give these folks their first michelin star already! excellent tasty food with beautiful presentation, great front of house, impeccable hospitality, while being unpretentious. highly recommended!"
on a halfyearly basis i schedule a dinner meeting with a business relation / old collegue. by coincidence i did see the website of cuisson and thought to give it a try. result : we did discovera hidden gem in the centre of arnhem. both quality as well as presentation of the food were very good. staff and cook perfect. will revisit for sure.
"we are regular visitors to arnhem and have tried many of the restaurants there, so when a dutchman recommended cuisson as a new restaurant with excellent quality we thought we would give it a go. we were not disappointed, the food was excellent. we took the chefs 3 course surprise and the wonderful presentation of the food was matched by the quality of the ingredients and the taste. the chef came to show us the pieces of meat (duck breast for me) and fish (for my wife) before he cooked it to ask if we were happy with it! i think this is the finest dining we have had in all our stays in arnhem."
"it is a bit hidden away and you may be tempted to go in one of the other restaurants or bars that you will pass, but it is really worth fighting that temptation and walking a bit furthe "
"we went there for a lunch with the kids. the place has a us diner/steakhouse vibe, perfectly decorated and even featuring us school bus "
"loved what they did to this place, its been years since i was last here. modern, industrial look inside. friendly staff, good parking, indoor and outdoor seating. food was also very modern and not too expensive. theres also a drive through! will be back!!"
"this is probably one of the best places to eat in arnhem! its a little but outside town (20 min by e-bike), but the food is amazing and the restaurant is decorated very nice! service is very good, cost a little above average, but i had the ribeye! lots of parking as we "
"great place to eat and drink with friends and family. local beers, vege options in menu. even when local was full and busy manager find a table on saturday."
visited with a group of friends. good is great and comes in relatively large portions. staff are very friendly and very professional. would definitely recommend to anyone. it‚Äôs always very packed so make sure you book!
we had a really nice experience with this restaurant. food was really good (we ordered the spareribs) and staff was friendly and efficient. we recommend this place.
"we visited the restaurant in august 2021, after a long day in burger zoo. the atmosphere and service in the restaurant is top-notch and even the huge amount of children did not bother is, since they have a playground downstairs. the food was great and cooked exactly as we preffered it. the only downside from my experience was the poorly washed beer glass, which resulted in stale beer. however, the experience in general made me want to return."
"we visited here as a couple in august after hearing reviews from friends. i miss the american dining experience and this place delivers. to start my boyfriend had the pulled pork tacos, tasted great. we then both had burgers and mine was cooked perfectly, exactly how i asked. he doubled his up, but said next time he wouldnt as it was to much. fries came along with mayo and ketchup ( didnt need to ask for it for a change) then as it was quite warm, we decided to get a dessert from the takeaway drive though. i had a milkshake, and it was really nice. plan to go back soon, its my new favorite restaurant that reminds me of ho "
very nice place. great variety on the menu. the mix grilled was excellent. they serve free coleslaw and fries with your meal and they keep refilling them as much as you want to eat. price is also good.
"we had a wonderful family meal and everyone ended up satisfied . we where first seared at the back of the restaurant and it was very dark and under lighted. we asked to move and decided to sit outside as it was a warm evening. the starters where brought out without any issues and where delicious. the mains where brought out 5-7 minutes apart, so the first 3 meals where sitting on the table roughly 7 minutes before the other meals where brought out to us. as you can imagine the food was then starting to get cold. i did complain and was served a fresh tuna steak within 3 minutes. apart from this the rest of the evening went without a problem. the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. the children had a great time downstairs in the childrens area. there is a cinema,junglegym and lots of video arcade games for the children to enjoy. there is also an outside playground . the prices where on the high end of the scale but the quality of food was good so i cant complain too much all in all i would give this restaurant a good 4/5. we will be visiting again soon and hopefully can boost the score."
super nice restaurant with delicious food. everything in a american style. the menu was in english but also dutch. they even are playing country music. so the ambiance was great. food was even better. the staff is young but super friendly. loved it! we had a very good evening. we will be back in a few weeks.
arrived late at nearby hotel and found most places clos 
good food and buzzy atmosphere. great basement play area for kids - much more than the normal soft okay (though that too). decent service. watch out for speed cameras in the area!
"my husband had the ribeye and i had the ribs. both were excellent and came with apple compote, coleslaw and skin-on-fries. also free mayo and ketchup (very rare). i took the rest of my ribs home as the portion was large. the atmosphere was great and i loved the decor. a real americana feel."
several outdoor seatings perfect for enjoying a lunch or a beer in the su 
"food is very good but a little bit far from the real american flavor. i asked for a glass of water and i got surprised it was in my bill, commonly it is for free"
loved to american vibes here. the arcades downstairs are amazing and so is the service. ruben and lisa were both great hosts!
"we are returning customers to the roadhouse. sunday lunch with friends and the kids has been on all occasions an absolute pleasure! food is great! staff are thoughtful, prosfessional yet friendly and familiar! kids have the time of their lives in the kids cellar which has a clean soft play area, mini cinema and other games! we will most definitely be back agai "
"we just happened upon this lovely tapas restaurant, and really enjoyed the food. set price and you can eat as much as you like by choosing from the extensive menu two dishes per person at a time. very good value but do book as it gets very bu "
"located near the pathe (movie theatre), in a nice d√©cor a well functioning staff with great food makes this to a very nice experience for a decent price."
excellent creative food in a cozy neighbourhood location. we had the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing selected by our waiter. the staff were very knowledgeable about each dish and the wines. service was excellent and relaxed. each dish was delicious and balanced in use of flavours and textures. excellent cheese course with local cheeses. a must if you are visiting arnhem.
do not hesitate. reserve a table. order the chef surprise 4 course menu. you will be amazed. excellent dishes with sometimes very unusual food combinations. served by very knowledgeable and friendly staff. and you can follow the chef through the open kitchen. unless you have elected to eat outside. very large wine selection with som very expensive wines! the chef is clearly on his way to high ratings and more!
we very much enjoyed trying all the different dishes and unique flavors. we really enjoyed our evening and will definitely come back!
we were visiting arnhem for a quick weekend 1-day trip and decided to have dinner at ‚Äòt volk. an amazing place! for only under 40 euros you get access to all-you-can-eat menu of fusion cuisine. the staff was very attentive and all the dishes - great! nice cocktails as well.
wow. i knew owner hui from a few years back in armhen and he was always known as a very creative chef so i had high expectations‚Ä¶ and it did not disappoint. this is really #nextf***inglevel stuff. a man really at the top of his game. whatever your tastes i think there is something for y 
a nice caf√© with a nice selection of draught beer and snacks. a good place to have coffee as well. the bitterballen are our favorite. a typical dutch snack served with mustard. it is a meatball shapef croquette with a variety of fillings.
"this is a great little cafe centrally located. great wine, food and atmosphere. visit any time of the day for good service and a cosy atmosphere."
"in arnhem for war and other museums wanted to eat local and low key. babo cafe was perfect. a very helpful bartender thomas translated the menu, we selected a grilled local fish and a slightly cooked hamburger (tartare like) with bitteballs as a first course, great local fried treat. accompanied a couple of different white beers and we were very hsppy. place was busy and price reasonable."
"first of all : order a double espresso here and you have had the best in town. taste, color, crema, temperature, a glass of water to complete the picture... the have a selective bakery selection that is worth trying! the food is easy & creative .. vegetarian cannelloni, hot steamy straight from the oven (with warming of course) ... do not forget the friendly energy of the staff... busy as always and always an eye free to connect again... there is a kind of a scene of clients without a name ... an atmosphere you like or not! i like i "

"brilliant mexican. we had the mexican platter for two. it was delicious and a great way to experience a variety of mexican dishes. also, the margaritas were very tasty. the service was friendly and efficient, exactly as i like it to be."

enjoy nice food and service together with warm atmosphere and nice climate for dinner for two in the center of arnhem
"this is our go to restaurant when in arnhem. good quality food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. we had a couple of cocktails, the burrito kip and combination de is casa with ribs. very tasty, nicely presented. guacamole is very creamy and we had some with our drinks with the tortilla chips and salsa. give it a try, it is well worth a visit."
"we enjoy mexican food in australia (where we live), and have eaten it in the us too. this was our first in europe, and it was of a different style to what we expected. however the meals were very tasty, and the earnings generous. yes, the presentation was the same for our different main courses, but inviting all the same. service was friendly, though a little slow at times. menus in english are available and at least one lovely server was very fluent and helpful. wed gladly return."
"loved the food and service here a great place for vegetarians i had wheat tortilla filled with spinach and mushrooms and topped with cheese , guacamole , slaw refried beans and mexican rice and we went on a monday when cocktails were half price strawberry margaritas delicious üòã "
"the restaurant is located in a plaza where many other restaurants and caf√©s are standing. it is also a few meters away from the shopping street. the waitress was very attentive and even suggested some dishes as well as explaining the portions. you get nacho chips with salsa on the house. i ordered enchiladas which is possible to finish alone if you order no starter. it comes with two small filled soft tortillas with either chicken or ground beef and small portions of rice, beans, pico de gallo and coleslaw. everything was very savoury however, it is not so spicy if you‚Äôre a spicy lover. i definitely recommend it. the atmosphere is very chill too."
"food was very tasty and we were very satisfied with the quantity ! quesadilla was great and so was the appetizers (especially spicy chicken  , salads). nice ambience ! recommended !"
"for those who love a good mexican menu, this is certainly the place to go. i went there twice and everything i ate was great! good thing to go in the summer and sit outside! love the guacamole!"
"myself and some friends visited on saturday night, it was very very busy. we waited a very long time for food, and the waitresses were not very attentive, having to prompt them on ordering drinks. food was tasty, especially the meat fajitas."
"i ate the enchilladas (pork+vegetables) here and i must say that they are very very tasty! spice enough to make you feel that hot flavour, although not enough to make you cry, which is nice!  i recommend it for a good mexican food experience!"
i was in arnhem with 3 friends on a visit to the battlefields. we went out with no idea what we were going to eat. we saw that this restaurant looked busy and took that as a good sign. the food was excellent with a good choice of 3 courses for a fixed price. i would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a spicy good value meal in arnhem.
thanks for the great service. atmosphere was very good and the food was ok.  margarita is perfect.  the tables was full and no delays on the servise.
"first the atmosphere on the restaurant is great typical mexican decoration and latin music. the staff was good. the food spicy as it was supposed to be and very good. the portions are huge! the picture is from the fajitas dish, were this plater comes to the table and you assemble your own fajitas. loved the beans and the guacamole! i would definitely come back."
"whether you go out for a quick trip to arnhem or you are visiting the veluwe, pssst amigo is a great restaurant to lunch or have a big meal. surprisingly good quality at the right price."
"havent been in arnhem like for ages! and decide this time to pay a visit to my favorite restaurant during my college period in holland,  and guess what? still in love with the food and especially the service! gracias por no cambiar!"
"this place is authentic, lovely food, nice staff and great location. we recommend highly and would eat there again. thank you"
food was excellant and as a mexican food lover was most impressed. my daughter also loved it and was a 1st for her. not bad price either and very pleasant staff and surroundings.
"while arnhem isnt used for its great city center, this place is right in the middle of the nightlife. its not open until very late but a great place to go if you want to eat something in a nice mexican atmosphere. the waiters are patient and they provide some coloring materials for small children. when me and my family wanted to put some tables together the waiters made no problem of it and helped us in creating the desired situation. i recommend reserving as it is usually quite bu "
"nice mexican food, fair price, good cocktails. you get nachos with a dip with your apperitive so you dont need a starter. thats nice for your bill at the end. portions are big enough. i choose the lamb and it was excellent. i ordered corn on the side, they forgot it but that wasnt a problem for me because i was satisfied with the size of my portion. and it made my bill smaller :-) nice interior also, bit dim but cosy and mexican. this restaurant was full all the time and makes good business. sometimes long waiting times to take your order."
"we sat down outside and had a lovely dinner. i had the spare-ribs and they were delicious. would have wished for more spicy sauce, but i probably could have asked for it. my girfriend had the tacos and claims they were really good. the atmosphere inside is cool."
"i have to agree with others reviewers that the margaritas were excellent, the food as well, the service too. really have nothing to complain about. they were restructuring the bar, so the coffee maker was out of service, but apart from that everything was peachy."
"we go here primarily for the margaritas, we even take a horrible 30 minute bus trip for it. great price, and great taste! food is nice too (for food i would stay in home town "
in this cute restaurant the food is great. i like the tapas because then i can choose different tnings at once. the tacos etc are great too. please do not forget the desserts because theyre delicious!!
since 1998 i have been visiting this restaurant and i have never had bad food. the cocktails are good and there is plenty to choice. its one of my favorite restaurants. i always make a reservation for a table because it can be busy here.
"ive been here on a saturday to have some mexican food with my girlfriend. the restaurant is located in the centre of arnhem, close to the korenmarkt. we got a table on the upper floor where it was unfortunately a bit too dark and very warm. after starting with some tacos we hade a plate full of meat as the entrance menu. it tasted very good and almost seemed like an entire meal. as main course i had the chimichanga which tasted very good. to top it of we had some ice scream which was extra good due to the high temperature in the room. the girl serving us was new and forgot many things but since it was here first week i didnt see this as a probl "
"visited with friends while on wwii sites trip, appears to be always busy and we found out why, some of the best mexican food i have had in europe. we were seated upstairs and found it a little dark for us (group of men) but as i said some of the best food. heartily recommend the chimichangas, superb. would without doubt recommend a trip to amigos if in town."
i have visited this restaurant very many times over 15 years and i havent eaten poor here. i have had almost every dish and ofcourse i have my favorites. im not a fan of the desserts here. there good be a change in this menu. this is not a reason to have no dinner here. the coffees and chocolatemilk are a good replacements :o) and the hot kalua is heavenly.
"amazing indian cousine, with an incredible amount of options (for every preference). friendly people and great ambiance. 10/10 recommend!"
"this places serves very nice indian food, rich in taste and high in quality. friendly staff as well, worth a visit."
so three of ate here and we ha 
"went for an early thursday evening dinner. ordered lamb korma, dal soup, murg tikka, garlic naan and roti. the korma came with raita and a small salad. the korma was to die for. the chicken very tasty. rice was included and the fine grain was very good cooked. raita was a big portion and at no extra pay. the roti was filled with lentils and the garlic naan topped with fresh coriander. we left with a full stomach and can no more than recommend this restaurant. it is worth a full five stars besides the fact the poppadums were not as crunchy, as expected and there was only one server. but we had our food within reasonable time. and no one else complaint. "
"we ate here in early august. it was a really good curry. we had chicken jalfriezi, bombay aloo and tarka dal. all tasty and very spicy. as good as any in england we have had. cobra was pricey but the local beer was as good and a lot cheap "
"the food was absolutely great. among the finest indian food weve had in the netherlands. the dishes are simple, like they should be, and very tasty. prices are very reasonable, t "
"very tasty indian food, great atmosphere and very nice and friendly staff. will definitely return and would like to recommend it."
"we went for dinner on a weekend. we ordered biryani, roti, 2 curries and tandoori mixed gri "
we were here in march fir a dinner with frien 
"went here when on business, starters were very nice as were the main courses, very big portions!! i would recommend the mixed grill!  will come again when in arnhem."
"when looking for the restaurant i wasn‚Äôt too happy that it is in a 2nd rate alley richt next to a local coffeeshop. but when inside it was soon forgotten. the service was friendly and the food was excellent. we went for the surprise menu. this menu really had something for everyone at the table, spicy food, mild food and severall vegetarian dishes. when i am in arnhem i will for sure return too this restaurant. "
"visited this restaurant in mid december, the food and service was great and was delivered to our table quickly, i had a lamb vindaloo which was very hot and spicy. the vegetable curry was also delicious. the actual restaurant was busy,which for me is always a good sign, and the staff speak english another bonus "
"i have reached arnhem late night & restaurant was closed, but they supported us lot, they opened the kitchen again and prepared food for us also my kid enjoy the food well thanks for the support"
"i travel to arnhem for business every couple of months or so and often eat here. the welcome is always warm, the food tasty and freshly prepared, and the prices are reasonable and value for money."
"been to this place now 3 times and spanning over 3 years and the place has got better then it was. we started with onion bahjis and kebabs and that started the meal really well, great quality of kebabs and really nice onion bahji "
the kohinoor is a lovely gem of a restaurant. staff were friendly and the food was excellent.   you should try it if you are in arnhem.
i love eating at kohinoor of india in arnhem. service is fast and food is super delicious. even the take outs and home delivery are well taken care of. papadoms get to my house whole and everythings still wa 
it was quite quiet when i went it but the service and food were outstanding.  id thoroughly recommend it.
this is really a very enjoyable restaurant it is very well decorated and the staff are very good we had 2 starters 2 mains naan bread and a bottle of wine  ‚Ç¨70 the food was delicious and good sized portions all in all highly recommended.
"everything about this restaurant is fantastic. the staff are super friendly and helpful and the food is just out of this world - well cooked, full of flavour. huge portions. worth a trip to arnhem just to eat here again."
all you can reasonably expect from a high quality indian restaurant. it does what it says on the tin.
"went there with a golleague and had the meat and vegi menu. you get a lot of dishes (actually too much for us) so only order this when hungry or share! food tastes authentic, service is kind. if i had to make one (small) negative remark, the naan bread was below expectation. otherwise much recommended!"
"wide selection of dishes with a range of spiciness. i personally like saag dishes, and they catered well for me in this respect. friendly staff."
"weve had food from here delivered at our place last night and we were surprised at how the food were neatly packed. the containers are different, the rice smells fresh and clean and was warm. we love the chicken madras since it was not too spicy. the paneer was neatly cooked and everything was just so neat, fresh and right to the taste. great papadoms guys. we were one happy customer last night and if the service stays as great as that, well patroniz "
for me this was the best indian food i had so far! been to around a dozen of indian restaurants but taste wise this is one of the bes 
"it is a place near rozet. the food was good, traditional indian dishes. the staff was also good and the atmosphere was cozy. a nice place overall."
"apart from the slightly slow arrival of the menu, i cannot fault this indian restaurant. food was tasty and arrived on time. i ordered rogan josh which was properly spicy, unlike the mild offerings from other restaurants in nl"
"we had dinner here with our friends and i love their shrimp dish specially that their shrimp comes from places where it is mercury free. the waiters were very friendly, the food was great and i suggest that you just go to their main dishes since its ample enough even for big eater "
"there is a lot of choice in kohinoors menu, from the chefs surprise 3-course menu, to the expected tandoori dishes, as well as a lot of vegetarian choices. the staff is ok (there was a table waiting to order, and the waiter was at the next table, chatting with some indian friends of his. it didnt affect us, but i guess that somehow the waiter could have been a little more concerned with all his patron "
we left it to the manager to bring us a range of dishes - we were treated with a lovely selection varying in spicy/hot flavour nice setting lovely evening out
"the best indian food in arnhem, really an authentic taste like i am used to in india. the service is good and the people are very nice. a good ambiance, i was feeling like home."
"this restaurant is just off a side street, near the holiday inn, arnhem - look for it, its a great indian restaurant. we only called in as it was raining and close to the hotel, from the outside its not enticing, but over come this as the food and service was brilliant. we all like our indian food and the selection we were given was lovely and tasty, with plenty of it. they also had sweets not normally found in most restaurants, proper traditional sweets not just ice cream or deep fried pineapple in syrup. next time we are there it will be the first place to visit."
"if simple and homey rice dishes are what you are looking for then you cant go wrong with the biryanis at kohinoor. in fact, it is even better than any of the nasi goreng at the indonesian restaurant or the fried rice at the chinese restaurant in arnhem. the reasons, kohinoor use good basmati rice and less oil and salt to cook them. they are also freshly made so you will really taste the spices. but be warned that it has one waitress to serve a sizeable restaurant."
"attended with friends from arnhem, and we loved it.  small, ok area.  interesting little walk as you approach the restaurant.  take time to know the town."
food worth the wait and boy did we have to wait despite the fact the restaurant wasnt very bu 
"we loved this place - quick and very friendly service, well priced and tasted really good. the korma was very sweet which i loved but it could have been a little too sweet for some. would definitely return."
well went to this restaurant the second night i went for dinner in arnhem well staff where friendly the owner and his daughter where working as well i ordered mix kebab platter the taste flavour where great for main course i had tak dal and bombay aloo the rice nan bread the flavour and hotness was just as like i had really great time 
"thursday night is buffet night with 10-12 different dishes for  a  very affordable price: ‚Ç¨18.50 pp  and check their facebook for promotion! our biggest problem was, we liked everything so, that we ate too much."
"a perfect spot for veggies. the persian potato pie with lemon we had as a starter was sooooo delicious, not to mention the perfect chocolate desert with raspberries. loved the backyard garden area. recommended!"
"we found this little restaurant using the happy cow vegetarian/vegan app. what a lovely place. set out beautifully, quaint but modern. the staff were really helpful, translating the menu into english for us. the menu was small - 3 starters, 2 mains and 3 desserts but all the ones we tried were excellent. they only accept cash and dutch bank cards. cost 67eur for 2 people, 3 courses and 2 beers each. well worth a visit, id be a regular if i lived near "
"awesome food, always fresh and seasonal. great mix of different food cultures with local products. and the menu changes regularly so you wont get bored. well come back again."
"what a perfect place for a diner with friends!the people are friendly, the service is nothing to complain about and the quality of food is really nice! this atelier belongs to these places where the choice among the different courses is not that big, but this values even more the quality of the food! it is definitely worth to try it and eventually better to book it in advance if the group is bigger than 4 people, as the space is a little bit smaller, mainyl during the weekend."
"we visited this bar on a friday night after dinner. it was a cold night, but it didn‚Äôt stop lots of brave dutch people sitting on the heated outside terrac "
"..well, at least thats how the website describes its own vibe (modern & timeless). pretty accurate actually. been there several times and keep coming back. the menu is pretty good but i would recommend the daily special - which always seems to be another notch up. oh, and on a sunny day enjoy the outside seating along with a g&t or a jd&c. makes it all the bett "
"nice outside area, great for sunny days. food is great, saw some of the main courses passing by, they looked mjummie! we just had the mix&dip platter, nice and different. the staff is nice as well."
"it is amazing after all those years, that the quality of the food is every time a wonderful experience. service in and outdoor is something made by hand per person. but the inner-core is still going strong. i keep coming back here with pleasure."
bar florian is a nice and pleasant bar to enjoy youre sunny afternoon. it has a big variety of all kinds of food. from freshly made paninis to beautiful sushi and sashimi. and this for a affordable price.
"we are italian and we know when food is good, but also dino knows it. from fish to meat, everything was simply amazing  goodbye from the italian volleyball fans, ciao!"
"the owner, his daughter and staff warmly welcomed us into their restaurant on a very busy night  we had excellent service, great food and thoroughly enjoyed our visit, would definitely recommend"
we went to dinos to celebrate our anniversary on a friday night. it was fabulous! they received us with smiles and congratulations in every visit to our table. the food was scrumptious and the atmosphere has a very intimate decoration. definitely we will be back!
"wonderful food and excellent service. glutenfree is no problem at all, almost all the dishes can be glutenfree and they really know what they are doing."
"visited with three friends after reading some of the other reviews. friendly staff three excellently prepared meals, cooked to perfection. surf and turf, ribs and a steak. would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant. will be back if i ever visit again. loved it. no photo as i was too busy eating it. "
"good quality food for a small price. nice menu, bit towards basic. great service. wine could be better."
"absolutely gorgeous food for reasonable price and great atmosphere. special thanks to our waiter attila , who made everything even more perfect :)"
"had a great evening here, enjoyed the hospitality and the great food. got a nice discount on top of that."
"sat inside, watching the town walk by very good atmosphere. a warm welcome, great servi "
"just on the edge of the very centre, so not quite so much in the hussle-bustle. i had a very tasty beef tournedo, cooked to perfection. very friendly service."
we had a very enjoyable dinner in this restaurant. the ribs were delicious and so was the sea bass. portions are very generous.
"the ribs are one of the best that i have tried and the service is terrific! ask for atila, he is always nice and willing to recommend good dishes!"
"i wrote about dinos back in may, this time we returned for the third year to be met with a great smiling dino and his staff, again he recognised us and showed us to a good table, the food like always is awesome, great value for money, service is quick and always by smiling staff. it was so good we went back on the saturday. his greeting was even louder than fridays with customers looking to see who had walked in, he had a special table for us and before we could order he told us he and his chef had arranged a special meal....a large rib eye steak and the trimmings . dinos always has a good happy atmosphere and i (and brothers ) fully recommend it to anyo "
"great little family restaurant near the centre of town. good atmosphere, great food and service at a reasonable price. only flaw in the food was the squirty cream with the dessert. tight space and steps means its not good for wheelchairs or prams."
"called in here for a drink on our way back to our hotel and on seeing the food brought out we decided to eat here. best idea we‚Äôve had to date in arnhem. staff were friendly and welcoming. nothing was too much trouble, and the food........ it was stunning. i had the mushrooms to start hubby had prawns then i had ribs hubby had burger. it was faultless and loads of it. we felt guilty leaving so much. a lovely little bolt hole in arnhem that i would fully recommend."
"i visited dino‚Äôs while on a weekend trip with my wife. we came here following the great reviews on trip advisor, and were not disappointed. this is a lovely warm and homely restaurant where we felt welcome from the moment we walked through the door. we enjoyed the lively, but not excessively noisy atmosphere and the food was great as well. we both chose the spare ribs with a sweet sauce. delicious! definitely a place i would be happy to come back to again. "
we visited this restaurant on the edge of the cornmarket as it offered three courses for 23 eu 
dinos is crushed into  a cornmarket cornucopia of bars and restaurants. great place to hang out and watch the wild side of arnhem on night time manouvres.
"i and my 2 brothers and a friend went to dinos in sep 17 within minutes we were greeted by the dino who recognised us from 2016 as did some of the staff and treated us really well. the food is great, a good choice, quickly prepared and vey well presented. your not rushed and it is a great experience.....recommend it to every "
"working in arnhem for the day, we needed a place to eat that suited tastes for each of the family, and stat! with my hangry brood in tow, we stumbled upon dino‚Äôs and with a quick look at the menu we flew through the door hopeful to get a seat in what looked like a popular plac "
had a lovely evening here.food really good.staff great. very attentive. would recommend it.great atmosphere. we had 3 course meal which was well worth the money.
the food was very good here---my wife is a picky eater and she really enjoyed it. i really liked the beers--the variety and the taste--especially the winter beer.  i also liked the atmosphere which was warm welcoming and friendly.
"visited the place with children, service was excellent and food came quite good. english version of the menu was outdated"
"i always try to eat at dinos when visiting arnhem. the food is great and reasonably priced, and staff make you feel so welcome. they have both dutch and english language menus."
after entering this restaurant two things immediately stand out: the genuine welcome by the staff and the lovely interior. in various ways cosy dining areas have been create 
"had drinks and meals here several times during our stay in arnhem, the food was amazing, top quality and service was second to none. we didnt want to leave! thank you attila and karlyn for your kindness and friendship."
"i have not found a reasonably priced restaurant eleshere in arnhem to beat dinos. the name suggests italian, but it is a mix of south american (barbecue) with a bit of local dutch and a smidgeon of french. everyone will find something they like on the me "
"4 of us ate here during kings day, so it was very busy outside with people partying.  the food we had was well cooked and tasty and the service was very good too. 4 very clean plates speaks volumes."
"delicious food, nice atmosphere and service. recommend for dinner and lunch. poor wifi in the back garden."
lovely thai restaurant in a beautiful setting on the river. service was excellent and i enjoyed my food and wine list was upscale
"this restaurant is one of the view most favorite restaurants of mine in arnhem. in a typical asian style atmosphere you can enjoy the authentic delicious food. for many years the same taste and quality. during summer time you can sit in the garden terras at the back or at the terras in the front viewing the rhine river. i will come back here more times! you can take away food too,, they do home delivery and organize catering at your home."
"the food was very fresh, well cooked and tasty. the sweet chicken curry with sweet potatoes and peanuts was extremely tasty. good service from friendly staff."
relaxed atmosphere with authentic thai food. good variety of choice. good place to go with your kids. they addapt the spicyness to your wish! a good recommandation. nice terrace outside.
"nice setting on the river, parking space available nearby. friendly service but the food, though very fresh and tasteful, misses the original flavours of thailand. the peanut sauce e.g. is a dutch version and the curries are too continental. but we had a nice dinner."
"we enjoyed the food very much, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service very attentive. thank you, we will back soon!"
this is the best thai meal i have ever eaten and it was reasonably priced. the salad starter was in a mouth-watering dressing and all the main courses were fragrant and tasty. we had one of the best meals here that we had in our holland/belgium tour this summer and we would definitely recommend this place to people who enjoy oriental food.
"3rd visit in arnhem, 3rd visit at rubens, its a special place for us and one that you can easily recommend - they never disappointed. we loved their skewered shrimps as well as their skewered veal. their winelist is quite interesting and well priced. staff/owners are professional, my special compliments to the man who grills!"
"again we agreed to meet at rubens as we do every 2 years - started wth unlimited shrimp but now our place to meet!! nice affordable wine, shrimp and cheese fondue made it a great evening abd the grill master made it  we will find a way  !!!"
four hungry southampton fans went here during our visit to the wonderful town of arnhem. service was excellent as was the food. sat in the square enjoying the meal set us up perfectly for the rest of the day. we had 2 steak and 2 chicken kebabs perfectly cooked.
"great and imaginative vegetarian choices not the usual veggie burger or omelette offerings . good service and good value for money.  nice location with a comfortable patio. helpful, smiling staff tolerant of our lack of dutch."
we eat here every time we visit arnhem and the gambas are always fantastic and with the great very friendly team this has to be the place to eat
"a traditional indonesian restaurant. outstanding service. the owners have kept to traditional recipes, so food was authentic and flavorful. the maitre-de found us (8 hungry persons) a place, although restaurant was full, and it was (theoretically) after kitchen hours. highly recommended.  (reservation recommended.)"
a small family reunion led us to kumpulan. after a visit to the bronbeek museum and a stroll through the memorial park we had an excellent rijst tafel. the food was delicious and the service very friendly. highly recommended!
"we visited the museum bronbeek about indonesia that is on the same terrain. the museum was a pleasant surprise, but this restaurant even more. they let people in until 1800 sharp, but dinner is served until 20.00. the building is a very nice historical building in a park with a nice view and terrace. the service was fast, the food also came fast. tableware was very simple, but the food was great! they serve indonesian food. we recommend the rice table, that gets you a lot of small servings of different dishes. delicious! price was 35 euro per person for drinks, meal, dessert and coffee. we thought that was very good val "
this is the place for the best indonesian dinners. the restaurant is situated in an old oriental building next to the bronbeek museum for indonesian art and history and home for war veterans. the restaurant would be excellent if they improve their service. it sometimes is a bit chaotic and a long time waiting for your food.
"excellent food, great original  atmosphere, nice personnel and good value for money.. great surroundings"
together with colleagues we had a lovely departmental luncheon at kumpulan. interesting to see the historic surroundings of the dutch past.
we had family reunion luncheon booked for about 40 people so this was a buffet style meal.  the buffet comprised of an assortment of indonesian cuisine dishes offering lots of variety for our guests.  excellent food and service.
"we have frequented kumpulan already for years and we keep coming back. not only is the food very good. the whole restaurant sits in a beautiful park which is home to the netherlands forces pensioners home and shares a lot of history with the restaurant. upon entering the restaurant, one is submerged in an relaxing late-colonial atmosphere which makes the whole experience all the more interesting. highly recommended!"
"the kumpulan restaurant at bronbeel museum and carehome does one trick: it specialises in indonesian food and it is the only thing it does. outside of the hague you probably wont find better indonesian food. and yes that includes indonesia itself. so for a good rijsttafle, head over here. dont expect anything else."
"the restaurant was overflowing with people when we arrived. fortunately they were there for an event and we were able to get a small table on the the enclosed dining porch. the view was lovely and the service was measured and efficient. we ordered the small rifsttafel and had more than enough food for another two people. our table was hardly able to fit it all. the great thing was that both my husband, who likes hot and spicy, and i, who cant tolerate it, were able to enjoy our meals fully. the flavors were excellent and it seemed a very authentic indonesian meal. the only bad thing was having to leave all those delicious leftovers."
this restaurant being a part of bronbeek has the proper ambiance for indo food. the service is friendly there is a good choice of menu and the food is delicious. do try the cendol as dessert.
kumpulan is situated in a historical park with a museum. really great authenthic indonesian food in colonial style building
"to go to this restaurant booking a table in advance is necessary. i regularly go there for business lunch. the bami and nasi rames, a plate full of mixed indonesian dishes, are pleasantly priced and very suitable for lunc "
nice little restaurant. the pancakes were good and well priced. nice setting surrounded by tress. kids play area was good. staff were friendly and helpful. the pancakes were very filling. the kids surprises were better quality than normally to be expected!
"we visited for dinner to enjoy real dutch pancakes and we enjoyed it very much. the restaurant is located in the woods near arnhem. there is good size parking available. the menu has a very wide choice of different pancakes, i choose the apple pancake and it was sufficiently filling and very tast "
"this is at lease the 6th time in a row (once a year in june) that we visit this place. we mentally booked it for 2018. service is great, foor is very good, atmosphere perfect."
"we visited as a family, my kids love pancakes and so much so at this restaurant we had to come back three days later. sweet, savoury, beer, wine, desserts - all things imaginable with beautiful pancakes. worth a visit for sure, go early as they close by 8.00pm. "
"if you are driving through the beautiful oak forests near arnhem and you are hungry, then go to the pannekoekhuis schaarsbergen. the extremely broad selection is unreal. we had venison and wild hare pancakes. they paired very nicely with the local beer that was on tap. the service was outstanding, even with a full house on sunday afternoon! this place is an icon! best pancakes that i have ever had!"
this traditional dutch pancake house has a large menu of all kind of different type pancakes. we come here every year when we stay at the warnsborn campground. great value for money
"we stopped here for lunch, enroute to a b&b we stayed at nearby. despite the name, this restaurant has more than just pancakes. none of the four of us had them. i had pizza, which was great. the wines and beers were also good. depending on the time of year, the patio is a lovely place to enjoy your meal."
"good service and good food in a traditional dutch setting, toilets very clean. no complains at all on the service and speed they work in this place."
"we went here before we went to the arnhem war museum (which is only 200m? away). the menu had a lot of different options in both sweet and salty pancakes. we had never tried salty pancakes before and went for those. the salty pancakes (with cheese, ham, salami + salad / onion, salami) tasted good, especially the salami. we also took desserts, strawberry sorbet? and banana royal.. deliciou "
lovely traditional pannekoek huis with great area for children and even a little present when we left. loved it!
visit here every year go for the blueberry hill if you have a sweet tooth very near the park and excellent value a good taste of holland
"a real tradition the dutch pancake house , staff are friendly and accommodating , choose savoury and sweet pancakes in a relaxing environment ."
"here you can eat small or large. the menu consists of a a wide variety of small plates so you can choose how hungry you are and also eat quite a diverse meal if you like. the service was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. the food was good."
"the food here (all served tapas style) was all delicious, with a huge variety to choose from. the staff were extremely helpful and the wine list by the glass has plenty to choose from."
"i live in arnhem but had never been here. i went after searching for places to eat lunch rather than a main meal. you go in and everything is explained to you by the really helpful staff (who speak english and dutch). you can choose a selection of things from the menu depending on how hungry you are and share them together (or just eat it for yourself). they recommend 3-4 things per person. everything tasted amazing. the mini burger was incredible and the fries were just what i wanted. as you can see by the picture, the sizes are generou "
small bites of a variety of cuisines.. the seating is a bit tight as the place is small. in turn that makes it cozy which suits the entire concept. the majority of bite sized orders are very good and the service is friendly and fast.. sample away and i think youll walk away with a full belly.
the restaurant is a must go if you drop by arnhem. the decoration is cost and the staff very friendly! everything we ordered was genuinely good and tasty. the menu is not translated in english but the staff is here to help :).
this place is my favorite restaurant in arnh 
"went here a few times for lunch. its a really nice small place, often very busy. the menu consists of small dishes and you choose a few of them. they have some classic simple dishes and some more unusual combinations. i like trying new things and never know what to choose, so this is the perfect place for me. "
"i found this spot in tripadvisor and decided to give it a try, based on the good rates.. and i was not disapointed, on the contrary, it was up to the expectatio "
i stopped here to get a quick bite and was so impressed with the food! i ordered 4 small plates and was beyond happy with each of them. the food is delicious and is inexpensive too! great for eating solo or with another person! would definitely come back to eat again. 
"just by coincidence we ended up on the terrace in the sun and then discoverd we could also have dinner here. lots of small dishes, too many for one diner, so we have to come back for the other dishes. i loved the soups, the kangaroo and springrolls: all very nice. very good quality and lots of options!"
anytime were in the area we try to go to this place. its a place where you order all kinds of little dishes which are really well done. not expensive at all and only good experiences here.
"small and intimate restaurant with mood lighting and warm interior decor. great eclectic menu served in small tapas style portions- from spanish favs like calamari and cured meats, to cheeses, prawns, bbq ribs, breads, soups and lots more. small but well bought wine selection and make sure you save room for the amazing puddings. "
"the restaurant has a large selection of hot or cold tapas dishes, including meats, fishes and vegetari "
"we visited with a group of friends. no prior booking but the six of us were made to feel very welcome.   the food was very good and the staff were very friendly.   we would definitely recommend for a relaxed, friendly evening."
food was delicious and the place is cozy!! it was full and the place is a bit short staffed so service was a bit slow but they compensate it being kind and friendly!!! definitively recommended!
"this is a cozy place with very nice and friendly staff, the food is excellent and is quite cheap! we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for our food either. i‚Äôve been coming here for years and would highly recommend it when you‚Äôre visiting arnhem"
"tasty food, nice salad with fruits, good wine, nicely done meat. they let me go outside with my glass of wine before i pay, so i could smoke. i enjoyed my dinner, i felt comfortable."
i found out about this place when staying at the holiday inn and its a short walk from the station. ive tried 3 turkish restaurants in arnhem all with great reviews but this beats them al 
"didnt expect much, after some less than stellar experience in arnhem. boy was i surprised. nice place, friendly staff and superb food. english might not be their strong point, but luckily food is. if you like kebab or turkish food in general, this is the place to visit. just dont plan any activities afterwards. you will be stuffed."
"saw this place walking back to our car from city centre. the moment we entered we knew this was a place to eat. i could call this a place where you could easily get drunk, hangout and fly over few hours just to notice where have the time gone!!? big oldish style windows, harmony of colors, kind people, few regular customers in their own tables. i recommend!"
yet another excellent dining experience on our recent visit to arnh 
"ive been coming here each week for the last year. excellent food, good portions, always freshly cooked and great service. not to mention reasonable prices. simply the best turkish restaurant in arnhem."
"went to ark after a long flight. co worker got the the meatball appetizer which was very good, shish lamb kebab not so much. it was okay but not seasoned much. overall a good meal but a little pricey. i had the stir fry mushroom appetizer. not worth the cost. beef kebab was a lot more bland than the meatball and fell short of expectations. a solid meal all around and they take credit cards including amex which is a plus. service was a little slow but there was only 1 server for the 20 or so tables so its understandable. "
"very pleased with my first meal in arnhem. having previously run out of another restaurant because we didnt like the look of it we came across this place. the staff were very welcoming, they tried sitting us at some bad tables but if you keep walking with authority you can sit around the corn "
"we arrived in arnhem around 4pm on a sunday evening. we stayed at hotel downtown with no restaurant. we were walking around looking for some place to eat but most places were closed due to the time and day of the week. this restaurant was open but we were apprehensive as we did not speak the language nor did the staff speak english. the owner was very friendly however. we chose food from the menu by guessing. the food was fantastic and plentiful! we ended up with a baked spaghetti, a shrimp dish with an excellent sauce, two different kebab dishes which also had very good sauces. everything was delicious and reasonably priced. we did have difficulty getting the attention of the waitress when we wanted more water however."
"tasteful dishes, good choice, rich in quantity, music in style with the restaurant but not too loud. today too often music seems to be a pleasure for the staff, not for the public. window seats offer a view of shopping people, a pleasure as well. close by public transport and parking garage."
amazing setting and wonderful food. i tried a variety of dishes and all of them were great. the staff were very friendly and helpful. this was a lovely restaurant up there with the best in arnhem for sure.
we had nasi rames and nasi kuning. taste was good with excellent service.  we had dinner on teras. which  was good. food had original taste
we got a small rijsttafel here. service was good and the food was amazing. the decor was fun to see. wish we had places like this back home in the us.
"this is wonderful landmark restaurant with an authentic atmosphere with very friendly and attentive, international staff in the heart of arnhe "
"nice welcoming atmosphere, friendly people, looks like run by a family. they could use some more people working there because sometimes you need to wait a bit. but food course was super, for a good price."
"we had a slightly long wait before our orders were taken. we almost walked out. so glad we didn‚Äôt! the food was delicious ‚Äî full of flavour, but not too spicy (perfect for someone like me who isn‚Äôt very good with spicy food). staff were very helpful and very friendly. i highly recommend this restaurant. one warning, though, the toilets are not very accessibl "
"fantastic food, surpassed all my expectations. friendly staff and good atmosphere. ive waited 20 years for an indonesian meal like this. we live in norway and went to the netherlands for a kulinaric extended weekend. the indonesian ricetable was the grand finally of our trip. all happy faces and no disappointmentüëçüëçüëç"
we had the batavia rijsttafel and it was good. very good favours and variety. the portion sizes were well judged as there was more than enough but not too much. a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant and good and friendly service. it is very popular. it was full when we arrived for our reservation at 19.00.
"we phones this restaurant to order some vegetarian indonesian dishes, which were delivered punctual and tasted very nice. portions were opulent, so we could reheat the leftovers the next day and still have a full meal. great!"
"i really enjoyed my dinner at batavia: cozy atmosphere, welcoming staff and amazing food.  the beef i ordered was delicious.  totally recommend!"
my wife and i struck gold when we stepped into this restaurant. it has a very nice indonesian look to it with all the wood carving. the staff was very welcomin 
we ordered a rijstafel batavia and it was a tasty roundhouse kick through the indonesian flavours(overall 16 little dishes). the restaurant is quite beautiful and the staff and owner are nice people. the service was also pretty good and fast.they realy try to make your stay pleasant.overall a joyfull experience which i would recommend to everyone who visits arnheim and wants to try out the indonesian cuisine.
"we had really nice nasi goreng ayam jawa en chicken curry, seated at the best table in the place: beside the window with good ambience and lighting. the ‚Äúrustig aan‚Äù and patience was worth it! <3"
right across the central station. courteous staff and good food. went there for lunch and had some really good indonesian food. couple of good options for vegetarians as well. which is nice.
"they serve tasty traditional indonesian food. we are really glad that weve spent the new years eve 2019 there! the service was really great, always eager to give an advice about the dishes they serve. the indonesian bintang beer was also very worth recommending!"
"return there every month for the classic indonesian food in a really nice indonesian atmospher, walls with bamboo, garudas complement the indonesian feel. like the sate kambing and the mixed sate plate, also the dish with the lon tong rice have nice terrace in front where you can see the people who walk from the station and buss area to the centre"
on globus tour staying  
"we visited batavia on a very busy night - had to join a queue - which might account for the lapses in service. the food was fantastic - recommend the skewers of goat meat and the prawn omelette (quite different from a chinese prawn omelette). we found it necessary to signal for a waiter for standard functions such as obtain a menu, order meals,later request cutlery after meal was delivered. our main meals were delivered before the starters ... all a bit chaotic that night, but staff universally friendly and polite."
"considering a table of 20 pre booked the drinks were served quickly and food orders taken quickly as well.we all chose the vegie combi at 19 euros,which was good value and food.excelent helpful staff.highly recommend."
"went over with my father and a couple of his old freinds last week for the 75th celebrations, this place was reccomended by one of them and it didnt dissapoin "
"it was splended! friendly personeel  we ordered menu for 6 persons. the drinks were in time.we were there more than 2,5 hour. time flies."
really enjoyed the food - the menu focuses on a number of banquet multicourse items; we had one and the plates offered (really only tapas style sizes) were delicious. location is the only downside (next to the busy main road by the station) but this is a very small criticism. recommended
a great choice for dinner when visiting arnhe 
"years ago we discovered batavia and it reminded us instantly of a holiday we had spent on sumatra. the food of course, but also the atmosphere and the people. we have been back many times and each time feels like a mini-vacation to the emerald islands."
"the food here doesnt disappoint. we were here for a week long business trip and had dinner here twice again. bami goreng, fried rice, spicy pork, beef rendang, and sambal fried potatoes is now on our must order list. simply top notch food to satisfy your asian food craving"
i have no clue why this place isn‚Äôt always rammed with hungry dutch. every single time i have been here i (& colleagues) have had a cracking meal. try the nasi goreng dwaja. amazing. very reasonable prices too
i have never been in indonesia but my friends recommended this place and i was a good decision. the food and the service are great! very recomendable!
"we had dinner 2 times here while we were here for a 4 day long business trip. even on a full house day, the food was served quickly. the food was good especially the daging rendang. great place to cure any craving for asian food"
"we came here for lunch to relive the tastes of indonesia and were not disappointed.  the food was excellent and the staff polite, friendly and helpful and an opportunity to use a few words of bahasa again.  will definitely make a return visit"
"having lived 5 years in jakarta, i sometimes feel nostalgic and look for indonesian restaurants, often to be disappointed. not this time. all was authentic, the sate dishes had just the right flavor, and the home made sambal was as hot as it should be. the decor and atmosphere is very attractive and the service efficient and polite. i‚Äôll be back."
"we had a great evening. staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice. but the food, that was extremely good. very tasty, and a good variety of dishes. the best indonesian ive had so far"
"absolut one of the best restaurants in europe. great taste, great crew, great restaurant.   warm welcome from the crew and lovely atmosphere. traditional taste from indonesia."
"a restaurant near the station serving indonesian food, nice ambience and friendly staff, very fast service. they have different rejistafel (including a vegetarian option); we tried the one called indonesian that is the smallest but still quite abundant for two. it was really delicious, and the price is definitely cheap. they accept credit cards."
"nice ambiance and staff. it was very busy therefore a bit noisy, however the food was very delicious. well balanced authentic flavors."
"great and fun times ! cheers üçªü•Ç food was good and also the staff is lovely , thanks allot and see young soon ;)"
"my friends and i were visiting bronbeek museum in arnhem. after a long day at the museum, we went back to the arnhem centrum and tried to find something to eat. one of my friends wanted to eat indonesian food. im, as an indonesian, very particular with indonesian food. we finally went to batavia restaurant, and i was surprised that the meals were delicious with the authentic tastes. the waitresses and the owner are also very friendly. it made the time we spent in arnhem so memorable!"
"staff were super friendly and the food was very good. serving size were really big for the menu. we ordered the grilled menu, and we could only finish half of the portion. good value for the money. was there for my birthday,and they played birthday song from djamrud and gave me extra spekkoek with small fire-spark, loved  "
"i went there with my parents and liked the place a lot. the food was tasty, spicy as we wanted and served quickly. big recommendation to all!"
"my husband has been talking about rijsttafel (dutch for rice table) for years, so when we arrived in holland, we kept our eyes peeled for indonesian restaurant "
"we ordered #4 group meal and it was very nice. service was good, very friendly if a tad slow.  price was pretty good - ‚Ç¨70 for three people including drinks."
"i think this is one of the best indonesian restaurant that you can find in the netherlands, ive almost tried every single food in there and so far i can tell that the food taste exactly like my mom cook back then in indonesia and my latest favourite thing about this restaurant is the decoration. it feels like im in indonesia everytime i was eating there, from the music and little decoration like the painting or statues theyre just looked great. that is why i highly reccomened this restaurant if you live or visit arnhem."
i am indonesian myself and gotta admit that the food here is really authentic like the one i had in my country. i recommends their signature nasi goreng madura or rijstafel istimewa. will surely coming back here everytime im in the netherlands.
"netherlands are known for their indonesian cuisine. havibg travelled around the country, i found batavia standing out and to be the best. their chicken skewers are just very delicious, ricetafel was too much for 2 people, but we were allowed to take home. friendly staff and service. i went back again for the chicken skewers and soup a few days after dining there. definitely a great recommendation! very affordable for a good meal. coffee or tea from the house made us feel special. "
excellent knowledge of what is gluten free and the needs of those of us who medically require gluten free! had an excellent meal and will go back! would thoroughly recommend!
been to this particular restaurant each and every time i am in netherlands.   my favorite and never disappoints.   in fact i am always in the love ok out for anyindonesian restaurants whilst traveling in europe and us and so far have not found better.
"good and authentic indonesian food, affordable price, excellent service. the owner is really nice and hospitable to us"
"very busy and crowded restaurant on a saturday. 1st time we visited and the service at our table was not great. we know this because 2 other tables who came in later were served before us. we had to wait 1,5 hour before the main order arrived... if it was fine dining we would not mind. anyway, the food totally made up for it, we ate it all! i mean after all we were starving and waited a long time for our food. the sate‚Äôs were so tender and well prepared, the rendang was super delicious. the sate kabing i‚Äôd rate a 9, near perfect. but my friends rated the sate babi a full 10. tip, if you are very hungry, dont order a rijsttafel, order sate, rice with rendang. by the way did i mention, they forgot our white rice?? so before we could finally eat we had to wait(again). i think we were unlucky because there was nothing wrong with the fo "
ive never had indonesian food before so i decided to give it a try. wow. the food is fantastic! the menu says spicy but its spicy from a taste standpoint not spicy hot.if you are here for a few days give this restaurant a try
"we had dinner in batavia restaurant last week, as indonesian visitor im glad to find the indonesian cuisine in arnhem and i definitely recommended this restaurant to whom may missed the indonesian food, the food taste is authentic indonesia foo "
"i would go back. the place was packed at 8.00 on a friday night suggesting the locals like it. we really enjoyed the food - we had the rijs tafel which was varied, tasty and very generous. the service was very patchy and the wine list was white, red or rose! we settled for beer after one glass of the wine. we had a great night and i would go back."
"very good buffet served quickly.excelent authentic dishes ,not to spicy .helpful staff.we hadnt booked but they found us a good table and we were rather late as i think the dutch eat early//would return if we come back to arnhem"
"as an indonesian student in arnhem, this is the place to go to eat great indonesian food. the price is okay, and the taste is very traditional which is amazing."
"to have a change from the pizza, fries etc we opted for indonesian good. we enjoyed it and had nasi rames n gulai kambing. a bit spicy but nice portion! service with a smile and reasonable priced. well be back"
"i study in arnhem , and ended up eating at this restaurant when my parents came to visi "
made it to arnhem after landing that morning in brussels and sight seeing all day. wanted something good and a relaxing atmosphere. batavia fit the bill. nice sidewalk seat to enjoy a leisurely dinner and drinks. i had the saffron rice combination and it was very good with a variety of dishes. more than i could eat. very nice first real meal on my trip. 
"i have lived in england for nine years and like a good curry.  but this was far better.  my pictures do not do the taste justice.  have the prawns, red snapper, and stir fried noodles!!!"
"i visited this indonesian restaurant with a business associate for dinner. neither of us had tried indonesian food before, and thought it would be a good idea to try it while in the netherlands, because it used to be a dutch colony, so it should be authentic. we were pleased, the food was very good and it is always nice to try something new. we ordered the rijstafel which was a combination of about 10 small dishes and rice. recommended."
being 25% indonesian i always try to eat this type of food in the netherlands. i tried the food twice and would give it a 7 with 10 being the best. not bad but feeling that the drive is a bit gone. gado gado was good but the vegetable could be a bit more crispy. i would come back but know better places in amsterdam/utrecht (blauw) and of course at the pentagon and lucky plaza mall in singapore.
"if you happen to visit arnhem and like ethnic food, you shouldnt miss this one! its located straight in front of the station, its impossible to not notice it. you can have a whole long tray of food to share in two at a very low price. its trademark: the sat√©!"
"on vacation in the neighbourhood we checked the ratings on batavia and made a reservation for sunday night. we are both indonesian food lovers and have tasted it in many different places in holland, belgium and in asia ( singapore, jakarta, bali et "
had lunch on sunday here after reading the reviews. good food and friendly service.  we tried the vegetarian menu for two which comprised of 10 little plates of various recipes - nice sampler and teasing of taste bugs. very convenient location
"have been to this loveley restaurant many times over the years, last visit was july 2016, and looking forward to visiting again on thursday 11th may. very friendly staff, excellent service, and the food is fantastic, looking forward to seeing julia and all the staff again soon. hugs from your airborne brothers and friends. charlie, jhonno, and mark. we arrived slightly later on our last night having booked a table for around 1900 hrs finally getting there after 2300 hrs as they were closing, but they still served us a drink, and a full meal."
if you are into indonesian food and rijsttafel this is the place to be in arnhem. it has a friendly atmosphere and good service and the food is good. the place is however still as it was 30 years ago. it could use some innovation and maybe the addition of some fusion. i have seen some very good fusion cooking in new york. new recipes should not replace the traditional food but to add some modern flavors. batavia is very traditional in food an interiour. but on the other hand the place is doing well. it was packed the evening i visited. so lot of people still enjoy the traditional style of decorations and food.
if you never have been to indonesia and still want to taste the food. come to arnhem and visit batavia restaurant. straight across the central station is this authentic indonesian restaurant where the staff has a typical indonesian hospitality and the cooks know what they doing. choose one of their excellent  rijsttafels
we ordered the vegetarian rijstafel for two. twelve different dishes appeared and we thought we wouldnt eat it all. how wrong we were. we demolished the lot because all the flavours were fabulous and complimented each other. this was my first rijstafel and it was a taste explosion. the staff were helpful and attentive and the food delicious.
good authentic indonesion food. its not without a reason they have been there for several decades in arnhem.
"my boyfriend who was in town and i stumbled upon this indonesian restaurant the other day. as indonesians, we cant believe how much this place feels like home; the decor gives off a very traditional javanese vibe. we ordered the beef rendang, ayam rica-rica (a tad spicy) and tahu telur which were all great. truly a home far away from home."
"this restaurant offers traditional indonesian kitchen (this not like chinese indonesian restaurants you find everywhere in netherlands with offer european tasting food...). service is good, employees very friendly. you can find indonesian food here like in indonesia. not far (walking distance) from arnhem central station, advised to park in parking garage under station."
was on a business trip and looked for a restaurant for dinner following advice of tripadvis 
"this place was a surprise, the atmosphere inside is very typical, staff are very funny and friendly, and the food is delicious... the price is not bad, and portions are quite big. is a good place to join a big group of friends or for a romantic dinner with someone special."
"a very nice place with great, friendly service and very good food of authentic taste! very close to central station and cultural venues."
nice place but the service could have been faster. i was on my own so felt like i was forgotten a little bit . the different meat dishes were very interesting though!
"the place is usually packed, so get in there in before the shops close or make a reservation. ignore the buffet and just sit down and order one of the many great indonesian rice tables on the menu. my last visit here i sat down with 3 friends from out of town and had a great time. friendly waiters & delicious food, what else do you need? we even got offered a free cup of coffee at the end, which we unfortunatly had to decline because my friends had a train to catch. heartily recommend a visit."
"all the food are terribly good. from sayur lodeh to sate kambing, it is so surprising to have this kind of indonesian food in netherlands. some food even better than some restaurant in indonesian. i will be back for sure also for the food, caring service and romantic traditional decoration. it was worth it to wait for 30 minutes for a table."
"you can‚Äôt go to netherlands and not eat indonesian. batavia was a good choice. it was a 10 minute walk from our b&b. we split an appetizer, had 2 drinks and ordered rice main courses (‚Ç¨50)."
"the location is so cool because the restaurant stay in the center, next to the station.very good ambiance & food.  the waiters are so friendly.                     very good place!!!"
"if you want to have a touch of indonesia and true indonesian food this restaurant is a must......its like being in batavia (in the restaurant) and only 5 minutes walking from the fantastic new railway and bus station. good food; nice music, nice waitresses....what more can one ask for."
"really great place, everything was great. food was fresh and tasty, service was good, and the people where very friendly. defiantly would go and recommend!"
"well, we liked it. our kids didnt find anything they liked, but i am not sure whether i can blame the restaurant - our kidsare like that... anyway, we had a nice dinner, what i would complain about is the ratherstraightforward service and the appearance of the food. i have no idea of dutch price levels, but it seemed on the pricier side. dont get me wrong though, id return immediately..."
"located near to the station and close to a variety of bars we visited this restaurant to sample indonesian food. three of our party (of four) had not eaten at an indonesian restaurant before. we were welcomed and were able to book a table and return later to eat. our waitress assisted us in choosing a banquet menu with starters, soup and 16 main courses - all excellent. although 16 courses the quantity of food was just right and provided a good balance. we were very impressed and would return. a very nice evening in traditional surroundings with very good food."
everything is very good and we have enjoyed ourselves very much! the staffs are very friendly and helpful! we like the atmosphere too! must come to dine here again!
being not very familiar with indonesian food this restaurant was a great find. we had a rijstafel and must say it was delicious. the service was great and very attentive.
"arnhem is not noted as a foodie destination, but if you find yourself there for an evening you cant do much better than batavia. very close to the station, batavia offers some of the best indonesian food i have had in the netherlands, and i have had a lot. well worth a visit, but make sure to book. it is very popular."
real indonesian food java style. some dishes are just like mi aunt and granny cooked. dont go for the buffet but try the specialties. friendly staf also they made sambal kecap for me which is not on the menu.
"during my 3 week stay in arnhem, there were only two restaurants which i alternated for dinner everyday. one was batavia and the other was an indian restaurant. prior to tasting indonesian cuisine at batavia, i had no idea how indonesian food tasted. i had arrived late from amsterdam by train and barely had 30 minutes to check-in to my hotel and head for dinner. thankfully i was only a few minutes away from this wonderful restaura "
"not quite a 4, but it would be unfair to rate it 3. positives: tasty food (sate bali to start, spicy noodles for main). nice white wine. good beer.  negatives: service was slow, especially the wait for the main course. decor:kitsch.  reasonable value for money."
"nice indonesian restaurant for both families and business meetings. right in the city center and close to parking and the central station.  service is very good and friendly, food is good as well."
real old fashioned rijsttafel. we had so many different dishes whith each √† different taste. especially the sate was excellent. there was also √† delicious soto ajam soup served
"always crowded and yet a very cosy atmosphere. i was there (again...) last saturday with some friends and enjoyed the buffet-meal (only in weekends). you get soto and satehs served at your table and afterwords you choose from the buffet as many times as you like. i just love the sateh, especially the makassar sat "
we found this restaurant on tripadvisor and decided to give it a try. we dined a few days ago and had a ricetable. it was out of this world. we have never eaten such delicious indonesian meal before and will definitely come back when we are in arnhem. the staff are friendly and attentive. everything was perfect.
we had dinner. food was delicious and fresh made. the staff was very attentive and friendly. we had a great time and we will definitivly come back and recommend batavia.
followed the tripadvisor recommendation and tried this restaurant... not disappointed. the satay grill was excellent with more than enough to eat for one!
"when we go to the netherlands we always go for a indonesian meal if we can. found batavia 100 metres from our hotel, and as it was sunday decided on the buffet. all the items tasted fantastic, our favourite being a beef rendang. we were spoilt for choice- there are loads of different dishes, including salads, rice and mains. if youre a glutton like me, youll get your moneys worth!"
"my ladyfriend from indonesia was traveling around in europe for a week and has to eat european food almost 7 days. when she arrived in our house in arnhem she told me to have then real indonesian meals special sate. we booked a dinner for 4 persons in batavia restaurant and ordered the  sate menu. it was a marvelous dinner i ever gave to my guests in the netherlands. the sate were very tender and good spicy, the side meals like rice are really cooked like our mother used to cooked back ho "
this restaurant is very close to the arnhem central station. weve visited this restaurant twice and both the times the food were very tasty. the owner was really friendly and even recommended which dish night suit to our taste bud. the only set back was the slow service. id highly recommend this restaurant based on the taste. 
i took my sons to arnhem from n.z. and suggested a nice rice meal sis said batavia  it was a perfect choice great meal great service and nice surrounding
"i am an experienced journalist with a love of dining, although i am, i admit, less than a gourmet. i first tasted and fell in love with, dutch-indonesian cooking decades ago. i and my wife, who does know fine cuisine, enjoyed this restaurant. the service of a stylish and tasty vegetarian rijsttafel, by a javanese woman, in this well-appointed, clean and atmospheric resto was delightful. im not sure ill be able to repeat the experience elsewhere in the netherlands, let alone in england, where we live. but id love to. ‚Äì david altheer, london"
my second time to batavia. first time went with my brother and the second time with my m 
"lovely place, fully booked but we could walk in for a quick bite with wonderful food, a lot of it and a very nice any friendly hostess."
this is small quaint restaurant. you are always made welcome and sitting at the back under the canopys is really lovel 
my previous visit was in 1996. the meal then was excellent. i was pleased to find that in 2015 the restaurant - now operated by the son of the original owner - is as good as ever. a most enjoyable meal.
we decided to go here for dinner due to the recommendations on tripadvisor - we were not disappointed. our waitress was lovely; she had studied in the uk and had visited edinburg 
"last week we opted for this restaurant because we wanted to have an indonesian dinner for a change. it is visited by locals and visitors alike and is very popular. nice atmosphere, friendly staff and we enjoyed our bami and rijsttafel very much, everything was very tasteful. after dinner we were offered a complimentary coffee. taxi just outside, very convenient. we will be back"
"we went here during our visit in arnhem. we ordered a menu for 2 which included starter and main dish for about 22‚Ç¨/person, drink separately. the staff were friendly, it seemed though that one of them wasnt that good at english, the place was rather dark but pretty cosy, not many people there during our visi "
"amazing meal for 2. the staff helped us out and we went for their recommendation, which was great. a lot of small dishes so we got to try a lot of different flavors. price seemed very reasonable considering how good the food wa "
"if you want a fun evening with great food, and friendly and attentive staff, you will not be disappointed here. we went on a sunday evening and had their smallest ricetable menu. the place was buzzing and there was more than enough food for the 11 of us in the party. thank you batavia crew, we will be back."
"excellent service, amazing food, ultra friendly staff and owners. we have had lots of indonesian food before (we are a new zealander and a sumbawan) but this was the greatest. when in arnhem do as we did and go straight to the batavia for your dinner and i hope you love it as we did both times."
visited with 5 other cyclists. staff were very helpful and provided us with english menus. the waitress in charge made minor recommendations to our order such as what rice to order. we followed her recommendations and were not disappointed! a lovely meal and pretty good value. we would recommend this place
"came with my mother and sister visiting from canada to try some indonesian cuisine. food was flavorful, great spices, tender meats and great service. we recommend the goat or the beef dishes. we chose a 5 course menu to sample a lot of dishes and were not disappointed - recommended for first timers."
"we were delighted with the food and presentation. coming from the united states where indonesian food is hard to find, this was a treat. service a+. we had waiter from portugal who never stopped working, he truly loves seeing customers enjoying the uniqueness of this cuisine. the owners expressed gratitude for choosing their place to dine as we left, highly recommend for those looking for an experience different from the norm."
the netherlands doesnt really seem to have a national cuisine so theyve adopted indonesian food as their go to choice for a great meal out. they were the colonial masters of indonesia for centuries and rijsttafel is the national di 
"this restaurant is one of the best indonesian restaurant in arnhem. we enjoyed the rendang, sate andd nasi kuning. must visit! regards, yurdi"
"my husband and i went here last night. we had the weekend buffet. chicken soup, 2 types pork satay and then unlimited buffet. good selection of meat, vegetable, rice and other sauces and accompaniments. staff were all very friendly and eager to ensure we had a good time. meal was ended with complimentary tea or coffee. we were able to choose from an english menu. the restaurant was busy even at 1730-1830 but staff kept their very professional manner and coped well. thankyou for a very enjoyable experience. "
as a first experience of indonesian cuisine we enjoyed our meal. we chose one of their starter menus and were not disappointed and left the restaurant very full and satisfied . the service was excellent- friendly and helpful and the teas or coffees on the house at the end was a good touch.
"great service, great food, cozy atmosphere! entering the restaurant you get a true warm feeling of indonesia...warm asian hospitality"
"this restaurant is conveniently located in the city center. i took my girl on a date here and it was fantastic! the atmosphere is very warm, cozy and comfortable. the food was exquisite and the staff really make you feel at home. this is definitely one of the best restaurants in arnhem, and they will make you love indonesian food!"
"went to batavia with a work colleague one night. neither of us had ever eaten indonesia food, so had to get some guidance from the staff on what to ea "
the best indonesian in town the batavia set meal is really excellent and we shall be there again the staff sare slso very friendly
as a regular customer for years i consider it a privilege to review batavia. the atmosphere is traditional indonesian and julia is a perfect hostess. during weekends they serve an excellent buffet dinne 
"ive never had indonesian food before so i have no way of comparison, but ultimately the food was delicious, tasty, with the right amount of spice (and the portions were generous). not being able to read dutch we went for a mixed grill platter overflowing with little pieces of meat (various animals) on skewers, ribs, some veggies and a fried plantain. was given a doggy-bag with complimentary fried-rice: they found the way to my heart. staff was friendly and the atmoshpere is relaxed. overall a good spot. i shall return."
this might be my new favorite spot in arnhem! they have a ‚Ç¨16.90 3-course javanese buffet deal that will blow your min 
"we had dinner here tonight because eva, a friend, had recommanded this pla "
you know the food is good when elder indonesians walk in for a meal. this is truly tempo doeloe. the sate kambing (goat) is heaven. when in arnhem go to batavia and indulge to lose yourself in an excellent genuine indisch experience.
"we loved our visit to restaurant batavia in arnhem. the food was delicious and authentic, the service was excellent and overall really happy to dine here. decoration was beautiful, makes us feel were dining in indonesia! well definitely come back when were in arnhem again. great recommendation to dine here. thank you tripadvisor. "
"among the four indonesian restaurants in arnhem, batavia is the oldest, biggest and serve the most authentic indonesian cuisines. the decor of this restaurant doesnt even change much since they opened. and what a decor! it is unmistakably indonesian. no wonder they have the biggest loyal customers."
"i have been to batavia many times already and i would go back without a doubt. food is good, portions are big and we are always warmly welcom "
"we ordered a meal that is served in ample dishes, 3 different flavors of meat. very yammy and satisfying. got a taste of 8 different kind of dishes with the price of one. interesting new experience for people who are looking for a different experience."
on our way to koln two of us from india visited this restaurant in search of some close to home food.. we had a lovely lunch with delicious indonesian food..its a must visit place..behaviour of the people is very nice and friendly.
"i went there as a solo business traveler based on the critics of tripadvisor. the welcoming was very warm from the waiter. i didnt know the plates so i asked for suggestions in order to discover the indonesian cuisine. i was offered the menu that includes appetizers and many small dishes as main plates, which was delicious. to conclude, very good staff, very good food and i would definitely recommend this restaurant."
what a joyful experience our dinner at the batavia was! we cannot recommend this restaurant warmly enou 
"holland has a tradition with indonesian food, for indonesia has been a dutch colony for many years. there are many chinese restaurants who also serve indonesian meals, but it is not the real indofood we like up here. this restaurant is very good, try the sat√© menu. it is outstanding."
"been here twice to have dinner with some indonesian and european friends. all of them loved the foods. at first we were blown away by the warmth of the javanese decoration in this place with the whole paintings, angklung, wayang, etc. rendang and udang batavia were recommended menu to try. i was just wondering if they serve a real padangnese food with the whole sambal padang and everything else. that would be awesome!"
"we wandered in. he liked the decor, she liked the menu. we ordered two very different dinners and traded bites. we will go back. note: people in a hurry may be disconcerted at the pace. hungry people who want to sit and chat and pass an hour or two will enjoy themselves. "
"what i missed most from indonesia after a few months away is the food, and i was very excited the first time i saw a familiar name of the restaurant. the staff was very welcoming and suddenly we found that the atmosphere was very homy since they use javanese decoration. the food was great, even though we think that it was too much."
we had not booked on a november monday evening but the restaurant was not busy. it seems to be run by a family who are very welcoming and the walls are decorated with indonesian wood carvings. we had the 5 course menu which really was too much for us but means that you can taste many different dishes. some are quite spicy but all very interesting. the staff are very attentive and also genuine indonesian beer is served. if you like this type of food in a pleasant atmosphere then you should visit when in arnhem.
"following the ratings on ta, we chose batavia for a friday evening dinner. i considered myself warned by the reviews about the restaurant being full and slow, so i made a reservation and prepared myself for the wait. but when we got there, our table was waiting for us with some fish cracklings on the table. drinks were served right away, and soup was served piping hot after a few minutes. main course (rijsttafel) was served within reasonable time and i found the flavors splendid! but you have to be familiar with asian taste to appreciate it. i can imaging that for other people, they might find it too spicy (like my 2 year old daughter, but she loved the fried bananas! "
"i have visited this restaurant many times over about thirty years. this was my first return for 9 years and i was not disappointed. the best rice table in holland, probably europe. try it for authentic javanese cooking in a friendly atmosphere."
"batavia, located in bustling arnhem center, features not only tasty indonesian food, but the service and staff are friendly and helpful. we ordered the set menu for 4 and got an array of dishes pleasantly arranged in small indonesian platters -- like a tasting -- but very plentiful. there is an outside terrace and the interior is completely decorated in darkened and carved teak wood, a bit oppressive to me, but my dining mates thought it was cool. . . in any case, the food was good!"
"service is really friendly. you feel welcome from the moment you enter. the restaurant is beautiful decorated, with nice private corners. it is easy to park in de parking garage under the train station, which is across the street. they have a large menu with a lot of indonesian choice "
"this has been my fourth visit to batavia in the past 27 years. yes, first visit was back in 1986. every travel to netherlands included a dinner in batavia. it has been 10 years since last visit so had some doubts whether quality is kept. it was great to find out that things are still the same. warm welcome and pleasant atmosphere are still here. ordered of course rijsttafel for the four of us. starters were awesome and variety of dishes that followed were great. service could be more attentive. will come back the next time in the netherlands. "
"this place is frequented for over 40 years on a regulas basis. being lovers of indonesian food its unfortunately the only acceptable place left in the surrounding of arnhem. the quality is good, well-organized staffs and certainly enjoyable for asian food lovers. the owners are professionals in this niche of indonesian food specialties. certainly well-recommended."
"not only is the food phenomenal but the service and staff go beyond the call of duty. we had missed our last train to utrecht when we wandered by batavia just after closing. on a whim, we tapped on the window and asked if there would be any possibility to order something. they were more than gracious. they invited us in on their off time and cooked up a storm of vegetarian delights. it was delicious! but it didnt end there, they let us stay and we chatted most of the night, telling stories and sharing our experiences. they took us under their wing and treated us with warmth and kindness and were happy to have us stay until our early morning train was up and ready to go. being travellers, myself from canada and my boyfriend from slovakia, weve met many wonderful and warm people but this bunch were at the top of our list. we couldnt have asked for a more wonderful way to spend the night. thank you batavia!!!"
"im an indonesian student from university of wageningen. i have lived in netherlands for almost one year. yesterday i came to arnhem to visit a friend and at that time i really wanted to eat indonesian food. i asked my friend if she knows a good indonesian restaurant somewhere in arnhem. she said that there is one of the best indonesian restaurant in the city called batavia. she made me very curious and we went there straightly. when i first came into the front door, i saw a magnificent interior design of the restaurant. it really feels like my hometown in yogjakarta. moreover, the foods are very typical indonesia and the prices are very affordable for students. batavia has fulfilled my desire and im definitely going back there everytime i get homesick. its definitely a right choice to spend your time here! good atmosphere, good food, and good price!"
"authentic indonesian food in batavia, especially the satay macassar (quote spicy) with a wide choice of dishes. friendly service, highly recommended."
"fairly formulaic indonesian, but food generally tasty and enjoyable, at reasoble prices."
"very friendly people. best indonesian food in town. lovely atmosphere. interior old fashioned, but thats part of the experience."
"outstanding restaurant. good food, great service  worth coming back in future. i have eaten in many indonesian restaurant in arnhem and central area, this is the best. find julia when you are there, she is the best host in the restaurant.  greetings from mexico"
really nice restaurant with a great atmosphe 
"we visited again recently and glad to say that this small charming restaurant still offers a good meal and good service. gluten free options also available. staff polite friendly and helpful. while we had not booked we were early enough to get a table, but later on during the evening, people were being turned away. so perhaps at the weekend safer to book a table. prices reasonable for two people with starters, mains, 3 glasses of wine desert and 1 coffee 71 euro."
a real treat if you enjoy tasty french bistro fo 
"have visited this restaurant twice and it was very good both times. while there is nothing specifically gluten free on the menu, they are happy to adapt or use an alternative ingredient(s) i.e. a sauce, for example. they were coming to the end of the hunting season, but they trio was still available and was an excellent choice - hare, venison, and boar, tender and succulent. 3 glasses of wine, a main course, a desert, 35 eur "
"you have to know where it is but this is really a nice little restaurant to visit, nice food and friendly staff."
huge and delicious!!!1! also onion soup was very nice. if you like good quality food for reasonable price this is a place for you.
"great place to eat very friendly food was lovely we booked for our first night having read previous reviews, we enjoyed it so much didnt look for any where else on 2nd night we just went back"
"i have been here before as i sometimes come over for business and like to have a change from the hotel food. i had my father with me this time and he said he would like a steak. we were not disappointed, it was a lovely warm evening so we ate at one of the outside tables watching the world go by. the food was beautiful, a very tender and tasty steak with a bottle of wine served by a very friendly chap, sorry cant remember your name. a perfect evening to remember with my dad!"
"ordered ribs like many, and they were tender, tasty, well done. not sauced much (my preference) but maybe marinated and clearly with a dry rub spicing. simply done and simply delicious. good crusty white bread, nice light home fries, a chpped green salad (ok dutch style isnt my favorite salad, but it was ok) and a very good slaw all come with. a bargain for 15.50 e, considering it was a rack + of lean meaty ribs. ate outside on a gorgeous evening and the service was professional and brisk, but not hurried. too full after only a main to even consider dessert, but the cappuccino i finished with was perfect with a lovely, botany fo "
"a very familiar and friendly atmosphere for this nice restaurant in arnhem. the food was simple and well prepared, we all liked it very much."
"we visited this bistro three times during our stay in arnhem,we had different food each time and we enjoyed each meal the lamb chops were delicious the king prawns amazing and tonight the filet steak was cooked to perfection. the staff made us feel very special and very welcome. thank you we had a lovely visit to your city."
visited the restaurant with three friends on our recent trip to arnhem doing a ww2 trip. we all had the ribs and can confirm that they were excellent and plentiful along with the baked potatoes and salad. would certainly revisit.
"food was fine, however, dutch food is not as good as good uk restaurants. so my rating is a comparison against other dutch eateries. the service is friendly and polite and good."
"i found this gem when looking through tripadvisor, so i visited during a business trip to arnhem, i was greeted with a smile and shown towards a small table. the place was already busy which is a good sig "
"visited this restaurant on a wednesday night after reading the other reviews in this page. i ordered the french onion soup for starters and then the ribs for main. both were fantastic and the best that i have ever had. i received about 1.5 racks of ribs, plus potatoes salad and bread. there was so much i did not eat it all, which is not like me. the staff were very friendly and welcoming. nice place and would definitely go back."
"two of us ate here before an opera performance at musis sacrum, schouwburg, arnhem. we walked around the shopping mall area and needed somewhere to eat. the tables on the stone patio looked inviting, and the staff were welcoming. the wines by the glass were simple but fine, and went well with the excellent bread and butter that came immediately. for dinner, we had a salmon filet and a steak. both were prepared well, with flavorful sauces. there was a cold vegetable salad for two, and the most amazing fried potatoes i have had in the netherlands. i dont know what made them superior to every other dutch potato, but they were crisp and golden on the outside but creamy on the interior, nicely salted and bursting with potato flavor and nothing else. the meal was very reasonably priced, and there was enough food that we did not want dessert afterwards."
"we went here on friday and both had the entrecote steak. they do seem to love garlic in this part of the world and there was a lot of garlic butter on it. the service was friendly, it was lovely sitting outside and all in all i really enjoyed the evening!"
i had spare ribs and my companions the sea trout (zalmforel) with prawns. huge portions (so i dont recommend a starter) and good service in this small but popular bistro located in a back street in the pedestrian area of arnhem. i recommend making a reservation for busy nights. we parked at the langstraat parking garage (which is quite tricky to get to - we paid ‚Ç¨6) and it was a 5 - 10 minute walk.
"excellent entrecote, with baked potatoes and side sauces. i really enjoyed the meal and the staff was very friendly. i recommend it and i would definitely come back!"
"just back from an amazing meal. the meat was so tender, the salad so fresh. the staff are warm and efficient and the chef is a magician. we simply cannot praise it enough. thank you so much."
"visited this one many times and never has been a disappointment. very good food for a reasonable price. especially when youre a meat-lover you must visit de bok. the service is very good, many other restaurants can learn from them."
"we spotted the restaurant while drinking in caf√© de beugel next door. the restaurant was very busy outside, but still plenty of seats available inside. the menu was limited, but every option was tempting. the food was superb and the service was warm, genuine and friendly. our group enjoyed the food some much we ended up eating there for three nights straight. while you wait for the starters the staff bring you fresh bread with a selection of tasty mayos. the onion soup, hot piri piri prawns and beef carpaccio were wonderful starters. additionally, the steaks, meat skewer and ribs were great. all cooked on charcoal fire in the corner of the restaurant. the wine list again is minimal. a house red and white then 3 other white and reds. we enjoyed a good south american red for about ‚Ç¨19. our group thoroughly enjoyed arnhem, but the welcome we received from the staff was stunning. i can not recommend this restaurant highly enough. if i go back to arnhem, this will be the restaurant for the first night."
"we looked for a good value place to eat something, not just a fastfood place. a waiter of a nearby pub advised us bok. and he was right. not a big choice of menu, but everything looked appealing. i had a steak, perfect. and very friendly personnel. very good value for money!"
we have been coming to arnhem for business & leisure for 3 years. we make a point of eating at de bok as often as we c 
"since more than 30 years, bistro de bok is located in the duizelsteeg, near the korenmarkt, arnhem. a small but fine place to be, where a great cook uses a charcoal-fire to prepare great meat and fish. great taste and nice people. best in town!"
"visited bosphorus restaurant with some friends who live in arnhem and they highly recommended it. i was a bit skeptical at first because the restaurant was almost empty. however the service was good and the appetizer we ordered, the sample dish i recall, was outstanding an enough for the three of us. at the recommendation of my friend i ordered a dish with beef and and vegetables with yogurt sauce and it was one of the best meals ive had in a turkish restaurant. exceptional food."
"this is a wonderful restaurant, the food is excellent, especially the starters and the vegetarian dishes and their pizza, according to the kids is yummy. the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel really welcome. in the summer (if its warm) there is a beautiful terrace at the back of the restaurant. it really is a lovely place for a meal you can eat at your leisure in comfortable and inviting surroundings. i would definitely recommend it."
"great food, very friendly service and excellent authentic turkish food. wide array of choices on the menu. spacious restaurant and a nice terrace at the back of the restaurant when the weather is good. affordable prices and you really have to try the desserts! recommended when youre in the neighbourhood..."
the food was really good and the service quite fast and friend 
"this place is a good one. at the table there is good service and friendly staff, amd the food amazing. for me its around the corner, and i hope it stays that way. the takeaway offers the same great quality as the tableside food. truely recommended!"
"we ordered a lot of food for the whole family. all was very authentic chinese/ cantonese/ traditional chinese-indonesian style cuisine. we love the shrimps, the noodles, the fried chicken and chinese vegetables. guess well do takeaway again."

"our family of five, while traveling on our ho;land bike trip, came here during a rainstorm to get out of the rain and to enjoy some dutch pancakes. the pancake choices were many and what we picked were delicious. the staff was gracious to let us stay a little bit after our meal finished to wait out the rain. dennis most graciously encouraged our 73 year old dad who hadnt been feeling well to lie on the couch - an unusual act of caring that we will not forget and quickly made us to become your number one fans. hope we have the privilege of coming to this special place again that has everything good about the dutch people and food under one ro "
"we came for a quick lunch after our visit to the war museum. between a group of 5, we had some pancakes as well as the soup. everything was freshly prepared, well seasoned and served with a smile. all in all really good experience and highly recommend"
we found this place by chance when we went to a park nearby.  we had some crepes and coffees and they were amazing.  lovely selection of savory and sweet.....so delicious
"lovely pancakes! the straff was very friendly, nice to our little kid too. service was fast.  everything is just like you expect from a pancakes restaurant."
visited this restaurant the day restaurants were allowed to reopen again for guests! we were greeted by a very friendly and enthusiastic member of staff and could sit on the terrace. there was already a high chair there for our so 
"so many choices but i was delighted with mine, an apple pancake with honey, pine nuts, arugula, goat cheese and fresh figs. very reasonably priced."
arrived late in arnhem after traveling for hours and needed some good comfort food. we saw this and knew we had to stop. we were not disappointed. the waitstaff were very friendly and the food was great. we joked that we were celebrating our 30th anniversary and decided to go to the netherlands for pancakes. to our surprise they gave us a wrapped box of chocolates. its a shame this will a once-in-a-lifetime visit as we would gladly return.
we were stressed: so much choice in sweet or hearty pancakes. the filling was of a good size. and delicious.
"great food, minutes from the entrance to the park. we enjoyed the pannenkoeken, along with the friday night crowd, families, etc. a popular place."
"i wish i knew of this place when my friend came from london and was looking for a good pancake restaurant. the restaurant serves a yummy variety of pancakes both sweet and savory. it also has sandwiches and desserts. but we saw people queuing up only for pancakes. they also have heating for the outside sitting area adjacent to the restaurant, which we found very comfortable. there is nothing too fancy, but still quite fulfilling, especially if you are looking for pancakes. after a long walk in the forest, thats a good way to treat yourself!"
"if you are going to this place the kind of pancakes they make are really good. you can not try all of them at once, but for sure try 1 or 2 and you will know it yourself."
very tasty pancakes! friendly staff! cozy terrace with heaters. would definitely come back üòä üååüååüåå
"definitely the best pannenkoek i have ever had in the netherlands. normally, when i eat pannenkoek, i am fed up after a few bites. this was not at all the case in this restaurant. it was different from the usual pannenkoek, crunchy at the top and soft at the bottom. really delicious. a pity that the personnel there was not super friendly. highly recommended to families with children."
after visiting burgers zoo we went to den strooper. delicious panncakes with every ingredient you can imagine. friendly people and perfect for the kids
"great food, great drinks, great staff - no complaints! not in a busy location but has easy parking. definitely give the pancakes a go."
"stopped here for a quick drink - staff were very friendly, the place is very child friendly with a nice play area. although we didnt eat here, the menu had a wide variety of pancakes and the kitchen smelt yummy."
"found this place after travelling from den haag. isolated location, but lovely outside terrace to enjoy food in the sun. service somewhat slow. however, food excellent in both quality and quantity."
our 25th engagement anniversary trip. we had just visited the kruller mueller museum and taken a 25 kilometer bike ride through the pa 
"just pancakes in all kinds and sorts. ranging van simple au naturel to stacked with all kinds of meat and vegies.   like all dutch places, parents dont have any control over their kids."
a restaurant well worth a visit if you like pancak 
"thin, hot and filled with good things--like smoked salmon, asparagus and cheese on a savoury pancake smothered in apple syrup (the monthly special) or fresh peaches and cheese sprinkled with powered sugar; 30 cm across. who could ask for more. well cooked, promptly served. tricky to find, but if you have been to either the zoo or the open air museum, it is worth the effort."
"what can i say, it is located in the middle of forest pa "
"a fixture on all my trips to the netherlands, this pancake place is great. located near the entrance of the veluwezoom national park for a nice bike ride (on free white bikes) or the world-famous kroller - moller van gogh collection."
we came here with some dutch friends and absolutely loved it! their savory and sweet pancakes were very unique and delicious! highly recommend! staff were very fluent in english.
"the ambiance of this old farmhouse is great. the food is good and i did not realize that there were so many pancakes and toppings possible. try the pancake with salmon, my favorite."
this cafe is a dream. plenty seating inside. great service happy cheerful ones and staff. outside we saw the honey cone waffers they put on hot drinks their speciality so entered. sitting inside my wife had coffee it came with cream on top to drink through and a measure of liquor. we also had cake. all was excellent and like most people in arnhem they speak english and very pro english. dont miss this place l give it max star 
really chilled place in the heart arnhem. best place to have poffertjes. must if you are visiting the city.
we order the pofferjuets a dutch special of tiny pancakes with butter and powder sugar. these were fantastic. also enjoyed a freshly made stoopwaffle. both were delicious.
"stroopwafels is a typical dutch product. on a raining day, together with a cup of thee. nice lunch too.  and you can also buy a stroopwafel for take away!"
delicious fresh stroopwafels and great coffee. the staff very very welcoming and accommodating. highly recommend.
"we had warm, tasty, home made stroopwafels at this place, with a coffee. they also sell them out of a window at the street."
"the staff make any business and our waitress/hostess at de lunchclub was out of the top drawer - such a nice, friendly person. no wonder they were doing such good trade, at the inside tables as well as those outside in the sun on an early spring day. we chose light fare that was delicious and with out cuppas, we were given a welcome glass of amarula and cream too. i thoroughly recommend this small establishment in the heart of the old town, whatever the weather."
called in here on a day trip to arnhem. there were a number of other places around but all looked a bit much for a quick lunch. there is a reasonable selection and the friendly waitresses all speak english. i originally asked for a burger but got offered a ciabatta special which i had. it was perfect as was the apple pie for desert. i would stress if you dont like mayo you need to tell them because like most places in the netherlands they put mayo on most thin 
excellent location and friendly helpful staff. all food really good from salads to sandwiches . great selection of teas coffees and cakes. freshly made stroopwafels‚ò∫
"we go there very often and everytime get a surprise meal of experimental vegetarian dishes. the price is fixed and very reasonable. the place is small and popular, so always better to make a reservation beforehand. the people are very kind and nice. food is good. the ambient is cozy and homely. what else do you need for a perfect dining o "

i love the fact that they serve organic food and vegetarian food here. the service is awesome and food differs everyday. i just wish the place is a bit more spacious but then - we go there for a healthy grab so it doesnt matter
"i love mams! the meals are good, the coffee is pretty good. you can choose out of a lot of options. i come here often to study on the first floor, but it can be very noisy so i would avoid this cafe in the busiest houres to stud "
best coffee shop in arnhem. the cakes are delicious and perfect for a break from routin. for a better experience i recommend sharing ;)
"nice staff and good hot drinks and panninis. plenty of locals and not many tourists. staff spoke enough english to order. would recommend if needing a light bite, hot drink and sit down whilst in arnhem."
"stopped here during a beautiful road ride around the area. we both had decaf cappuccino and it was fabulous, definitely the best coffee i‚Äôve had in holland. i had apple pie and he had chocolate fudge cake.... omg both were incredible, great that the apple cake wasn‚Äôt spoilt by putting sultanas in, the crust was super short and crunchy. the choc cake was gooey, sticky and fabulou "
one of my favourite placets to get a good coffee and something healthy for lunch. a lot of variation in the food! staff is also really nice

"nice little sandwich place off willemsplein. they serve a variety of salads and sandwiches, coffee, tea and beer. good atmosphere for a quick bite at a good price."
"in general, it is a really cozy place. staff speaks good english so it wouldnt be a problem if you are international. you could also ask for a blanket if its cold outside. their desserts are okay. wraps are awesome and great quality. coffee is much better than at any other places and not expensive as well. staff needs to look out for not evenly cleaned cutlery when they serve food, a couple of times had to ask for another fork/spoon because mine was dirt "
one of my favorite place in arnhem where i can just chilling out and enjoying myself and my vacation!! just visit it .. thank you
i went here with a friend for lunch. the location is so perfect. really close to all the shops as also to the train station. it was crowded on a fridaymidday. the service was still pretty good. they even offered me to be able to charge my phone at my table with their powerbank. so nice! there was plenty of choice for healthy and non-healthy options for food. it all looked very delicious. and so was the coffee.
"in essence a kind of hip coffee bar in the centre of arnhem. home made pies are wonderful, pricing is quite ok. nice atmosphere. enjoyed it."
there are all kinds of seating arrangements. there‚Äôs also a high chair for children and low tables with matching chairs. all kinds of people visit this pla 
"im avid coffee and tea drinker, so naturally i was drawn into this shop, it quickly became my favorite.  and for that the reasons are many, free wifi (always a plus), happy nice employees, and finally amazing coffe and tea (i recommend the chai latte)"

"visited for dinner, portions were very generous, so be aware if you are ordering a starter! food very tasty and nicely presented, staff attentive without being intrusive, would definitely recommend this indian restaurant"
"...& got masterchef! its a strange eat all you can restaurant & we wondered if it might fail but the food was excellent, a real little gem."
"we are not specialist in indian food so, we asked for a recomendation and it was really good. service was phenomenal as well"
normally week days they use to have buffet which is around 18 eur pp (not sure 16 eur) was really good food we enjoyed lot
"on sunday night, at 20 hrs, it was a very busy place! but it didnt take long to be able starting dinner. excellent, cos we dont like to wait endlessly. staff is very friendly."
"took out an indian dish in stead of eating in-house. it was tasty, but the balance between meat and vegetables/sauce was way off. more sauce then meat or veggies. a bit too expensive as well. perhaps eating indoors is better."
"i really didnt want to give 5 stars, because then the place would be even busier. the food is very good, the flavors are delicious and the staff is very friendly. i liked the way the place is decorated. the food is not expensive, but good quality. only downside is the number of patrons which makes waiting times a bit longer sometimes. "
"food is delicious, great flavors!! super friendly staff, but the wait was a bit long. i went twice in the last week and both times i was there for over 3 hours for a 3 course meal. didnt care for the desserts much, main courses and starters were great. they also do take out a lot, which might explain our longer wait. so that might be a better option unless you have all the time in the world :) and if the weather allows, theres a cute outside sitting area in the back! enjoy!"
"from the outside the restaurant looked an interesting mix of indian objet dart and lanterns. the menu however looked liked a very ordinary list of anglicised curries. the meal though was an exciting mixture of dishes with flavours that were really fresh and danced across your tongue. the manageress and staff could not do enough for us and our young daughter. excellent meal, ambiance and service. thank you."
"the food was delicious. from prawn tikka masala to the spicier lamb madras it was cooked freshly, beautifully seasoned - subtle, complex and sufficient for our party of 4 (big and discerning eaters). we will definitely come again and definitely recommend this restaurant."

great place to enjoy an amazing coffee next the the square and the old trade post of the town center. amazing brunches with a lot of choices. the staff was polite and helpful!
very nice place for a brunch or just a cup of coffee . the french toast was perfect as well as the avocado toast
"this place is in a quieter street in the centre, which is perfect if you dislike crowded places. the lemonades we ordered were really special and tasty. the lobster roll was delicious, it tasted really fresh. i highly recommend this place."
"we‚Äôve been in the city for a spontaneous brunch and had the pleasure to find this beautiful, sweet cafe next to the city center. the place is lovely designed with a charming vintage look and the food/drinks perfectly round up the romantic atmosphere. even with slightly higher prices, the overall package/value you get is absolutely recommendable. the service girls are even sweeter than their choice of cakes ;) looking forward to visit this place again!"
"we had a great salad and tuna melt. friendly staff. just behind the main square, so it does not have the feel of too touristy."
"really good place to have breakfast. the place looks light and spacious, good soft music in the background, excellent staff/very friendly, and the food is delicious."
good selection for breakfast and coffee for weekend brunch! may be a little wait time but well worth it. got the avocado toast with drip coffee and found it good bang for my buck.
"service was friendly and fast, coffee was superb and the avo and bacon toast was delicious and the best breakfast i have found in the netherlands (where it seems good breakfasts are hard to find!). highly recommend."
"i bought fresh orange juice, coffee latte and very good french toast. beautiful surroundings, pleasant service. to recommend!"
"great service, delicious food in a nice price. pumpkin latte is great for a cold autumn day. food is freash."

when the city is still a sleep and you wanne get a good cappuccino go here. they open @ 08:30! i tried to have lunch there often but they are always full
nice cozy cafe close to the main square. they serve cooked breakfast (a rarity in holland). they also have good service in a nice atmosphere.
"this was my first afghan restaurant in my life. i had a plate for pilaf and 3 dishes, saag, curry chicken and meat bowl. food was nice and decent.i don‚Äôt know if it was afghan original because i had similar dish in uzbekistan or some other islamic countries. i had afghan tea after dinner it was nice with spices. wait for a while, it takes time that taste comes out and a bit too ho "
"this restaurant has the most delicious food in nijmegen! its reasonably priced, authentic, traditional food. i recommend the mantoe for entree and any of the rice dishes (with 3 accompanying sides). a must try is the traditional coriander chutney; served at the beginning of the meal with 2 other dips. the staff are very friendly and families are welcome. our young kids were given pencils and paper and love to eat at this restaurant also. afghani food is the perfect mix between northern asian/indian and middle eastern cuisine. the food and experience at hafiza and flavours will not disappoint i am sure."
"excellent food and service. we ordered online. the food arrived exactly on time. it was also a safe delivery. we ordered chabi kebab, qabeli palaw and narenj palaw with a range of vegan, vegetarian and meat side dishes. this was the first time we tried afghan food, and it was amazing. perfectly seasoned and cooked. the palaws were great on their own. i can imagine them as light summer dishes. ill eat there as often as i can. i wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant!"
"this place serves tasty afghan cuisine for a reasonable price. i took the sweet rice with orange peel, almonds and pistachio combined with 3 sides: pumpkin, kofta and veal. food was likely prepared in advance but that didnt matter as it was very tasty and full of flavor. the exotic home made ice cream was a great way to end this dinner. service provided by the staff was friendly and helpful. recommend!"
"this was the first time i tried afghan food and i really enjoyed it. we selected a rice dish with three accompanying dishes, mostly vegetables and some meat. each flavourful dish tasted great and was distinct from the other ones. make sure to select the pumpkin and the zucchini side dishes. their selection of wines is somewhat limi "
the food is heavenly delicious. the best food i ate in a very long time. the staff is very friendly. they have made this afghan corner with nice paintings and afghan mattresses which gives you a cozy ambiance. the music was also peaceful and at a perfect volume. five stars from me.
"first go at afghani food and it was delicious. staff/owners were super friendly and helpful. contrary to other reviews i saw, there is an english menu you just need to ask for it. highly recommend a meal here."
"the food is amazing, we loved everything. the place is elegant and service excellent. strongly suggested!"
"we were spending the weekend in nijmegen, without defined plans. after a visit to the orientalis museum we got in the mood to eat eat food. we found an indication to hafiza and landed there to try out. it was amazing. delicious food in quiet environment for eating. really became my top indication in nijmegen"
"we were exploring a quiet and good place to dine. we looked for an unusual cuisine as we had been traveling for many days eating british, dutch and indian food. we went to hafiza as you often do n "
"the service, the place and the food is just amazing! !a modern restaurant with an oriental touch we loved every minute there."
"hafiza is situated opposite the central station in nijmegen, the oldest city in the netherlands. the menu is completely afghan, i see all the afghan specialties i was eating in shar-e-naw in kabul over the last couple of years. the mantou is of excellent quality and the diverse rice dishes are of excellent afghan quality. of course, the ferni, a special afghan desert, cannot be missed. the afghan music brings you in the real afghan atmosphere. the only difference with the real afghanistan is that there is no special room for women and families. so all sexes have to sit together. i do not see that as a problem in nijmegen."
i went out for dinner with a colleague scouting for a good restaurant to take some work guests . its often hard to find g 
we had a diner withour family of 4 in this cozy restaurant. the staff was very friendly and the food tasted excellent. we love the spices of the afghan cuisine! also lots of vegetarian choices.
this is the place where in earlier days bagles and beans was located. really nice make-over and see-through kitchen! it was our first time being here and i must admit that it was a very nice experience. very friendly personnel and the food we had for lunch was excellent. will surely come back to this place.
"surprisingly good bar and restaurant from the same owner as hotel the prince. nice decoration, open kitchen and quality food. we enjoyed the fresh lokal white asparagus with salmon very much. will be back!"
"quiet around 5.30, later it got busier. service is quick but friendly. decent food for reasonable price. i asked for bleu tournedos and usually get mine overcooked. not here. bleu is ble "
"we had dinner here on a friday evening, even though it was quite busy we experienced a friendly service. both the tournedos and the entrec√¥te were excellent."
"we had a light lunch at this place while visiting nijmegen. quality of food and drinks is good, service ok."
"i had a good breakfast, and though small the coffee has a very relaxed atmosphere. prices were very reasonably."
"this place is really cozy and i love sitting here. people come here to have a coffee or a quick lunch snack some of them play boardgames, chat or simply read a paper. they do have good coffee and for the lactose intolerant or vegan it can be ordered with soya milk. the food is basic, but well made and fresh. they offer a variety of sandwiches, salads and soups, typical for lunch in the netherlands. you can sit outside if you want to. they do have a bookexchange, primarily dutch and english books, where you can just swap your finished book for another. staff is really friendl "
"good food after food stroll in kronenburgerpark. great combo food and stroll, easy reachable @ centre. fresh made good food. nice salade sandwiches soup cakes and coffee or tea‚Äôs. all good"
"dropped in for a coffee and saw the types of yyoghurt fantasies being offered so we tried some. the gentleman preparing went out of his way to explain the various components of the dishes and went about building them. they were excellent, well presented in a very rustic environment (kind of cafeesque) with many open computers and young dialogu "
decided to take a break from our usual cafe and try somewhere new. we only had drinks but they were very tasty and fresh. the yogurt dishes looked delicious too.
stumbled upon this place and decided to try their yoghurts. the place is not that big but cozy. lovely fresh homemade yoghurt with great additions to choose from. great place for breakfast!
"we stopped by this place to take shelter from the rain, and to see if they served soy cappuccinos. they sure do cater to people with different dietary requirements, such as lactose intolerance. when i read the ‚Äúyoghurt‚Äù sign i first thought they meant frozen yogurt. but they actually mean the yogurt you eat for breakfast (or dessert in the nl). they have many kinds - including almond and coconut yogurt for the anti-lactose people. this goes hand in hand with just about any topping you can imagine, from brownie chunks to blueberries or fresh dates. the sandwiches looked amazing, too, although i didn‚Äôt get to try them. i‚Äôll definitely be back for more. stop by this place when you‚Äôre in nijmegen. it‚Äôs well worth it!"
"a very good feel and a cosy, contemporary interior. the fresh orange juice and smoothie tasted really good, as did the croissants. service is friendly and swift, and it also caters for children."
"the venue has a cool style and great food and drinks. a bit costly in some parts, but worth it. perfect place to spend an hour or two in calm athmosphere."
"my friends and i went there for a brunch and we were positively surprised: we got a nice selection of yoghurt with all kinds of toppings. the homemade yoghurt was fresh, the juices were delicious and the atmosphere was also nice."
"just came across this place whilst wandering around the centre of nijmegen. doesnt appear to leap out at you, but filled our need for coffee and cake. good coffee, slixe of carrot cake did us just fine. eur13. small menu and perhaps a little quirky, but ok."
this cute little cafe offers something for everyone with a cosy ambience and friendly staff. we chose coffees and almond croissants which took a little time to arrive as they had been warmed in an oven and served with cream. yummy!!! the lunch menu looked good and the prices were very good. a real find.
great for a quick lunch break! we stopped by on our bike trip heading for the north sea and had a quick lunch break. the sandwiches and tostis are definetly worth am try! these also dell good coffee and homemade lemonade.
"i liked this place so much. i ordered one sandwich with chicken, avocado, parmesano and sause and it was amazing!! and also the soup van de dag is heerlijk!!"
heared good recommendations so decided to check it out. the pokebowl was very tasty. we also had an icecoffee and the awesome thing was that we were asked if we wanted is sweetened. such a kind question. very friendly and genuine waitress. will come back to try the rest of the menu 
"we had dinner on a september evening on the terrace still nice in the sun.  food and service were both very good value for the money.  portions were nice, vegetables fresh.  just a very enjoyable evening."
"lovely people, great breakfast and clean rooms. what do you need more? ill be staying again. thank you. :)"
"the best vega kroketten a man can find. friendly service, and beautiful location right on the grote markt. highly recommended!"
"this hotel with restaurant is back on track! the new owners know what style is and how to make the customers feel comfortable. we were with a big group, so we had a limited menu as their concept is you can pick three dishes to make your own meal. that didn‚Äôt bother us at all. the dishes were served a bit cold, that is a thing that could be improved. they really did a great job on renovating."
"this restaurant is something special, the food you get in all kind of different plates is wonderfully and really prepared fresh and really tasty specially because it is mostly healthy food . even if you are on a dieet you can find something what fit‚Äôs in it for sure. you can sit in the bar and enjoy watching how they cook and prepare your food full of passi "
"i can not relate with the negative reviews. i went there tonight for the first time and it was delicious. to be honest, the portions seems small until you start with it. we orded an extra mezze besides the chefs menu because our eyes were bigger than our tummys. everything had a different taste and was good. they offered to give us a doggybag, so tomorrow the lunch is again mezze. i would recommend it to everyone who wants something different than the usual. price is also fair if you see how much work theres put in. kind waitress, nice chefs!"
the souk only just opened its doors. we were there the 3rd week of its i existence. we had dinner at the bar with view at the kitchen. was very nice to see how relaxed the food was prepared. the mezze (all small dishes) were excellent and had great tastes from the mediterranean kitche 
"i read some reviews - but not on here. so, we were hesitant when we went in. the other reviews must be of a different restaurant than tonight. the ladies taking orders and serving were very good and the food excellent. i eat a lot of curry and this is very good ‚Äúindian‚Äù food. would we go again? definitely."
"they serve a very nice mango lassi and the food is absolutely tasty as well. the people are really friendly too, the only minor downside is that the restaurant can feel a bit packed."
just happened to find this restaurant on trip advisor this evening and decided to eat here. the service was friendly and professional. there was plenty to choose from on the menu. we thoroughly enjoyed the food here and we would definitely come here again and recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves indian food. delicious!!!
we were on a visit in holland and had an early evening meal in the india gate retsurant. the food was delicious and we very much enjoyed the friendly welcoming atmosphere there as well as the good style interior decor. a pity that we didnt have more time to spend in this place...we had to leave early for we had to return to germany the same evening. but we will definitely come back!!!
"last night, we had a lovely vegetarian dinner at india gates restaurant in nijmegen. i enjoyed the hot tea that accompanied the vegetables with rice too. cosy atmosphere. recommended!"
real authentic indian food at its best.  lovely ambiance and the service very attentive.  will definitely frequent this restaurant.
"i‚Äôve been to many indian restaurants around the world and this one was one of the bests! mango lassi and indian tee are super recommended. i took prawns in spicy tomato sauce and liked it a lot. the waitress was very kind and funny, dressed in a beautiful traditional salwar. i would not mind coming back again. i am from hungary by the way ;)"
i have been a customer for quite a few years and it is hands down the best and most authentic indian restaurant in nijmegen and the bigger region. since ive been a customer for some time it really stands out that the quality of the food has been consistent throughout the entire time!! ive seen otherwise in a lot of other restaurants unfortunately .
"tonight, we had a lovely, and not too spicy, dinner at this relatively tiny restaurant in nijmegen - in preparation of our upcoming trip to india. the green wood and other interior decoration breathed an authentic atmosphere. the staff was welcoming and helpful."
"on a short stopover in nijmegen decided to go for dinner. the restaurant is located right in the center, central station is 7-8 min walk aw "
something different in nijmegen! a really good little restaurant. both lamb and chicken curries were good and the vegetarian side dish of baked chilli cauliflower was terrific. reasonably priced.
this hotel perhaps is the best indian punjabi food hotel in the netherlands. it has almost all the options available for indian food.
"being an avid fan of authentic, spicy indian food, i always look forward to my trips to europe where the indian food is more authentic than that in the us. while on a recent trip to the netherlands where i was staying in the city of nijmegen, i came across india gate. i usually judge an indian restaurant by the spiciness of their vindaloo. i was pleasantly surprised when the vindaloo i ordered at india gate was on par with that of indian restaurants in the uk (which to me is the gold standard in europe). the staff were friendly and the quality of food was excellent!"
i have been to this restaurant couple of times in last 2 months while i was there for business. restaurant is small but the food quality and services are too good. owner personally ensures that you get the best food and services promptly. i will recommend to anyone who visits nijmegen to try this restaurant
"very cozy and romantic restaurant. real indian owner and food. the spicy dishes are very spicy, i loved it."
the dutch arent renowned for good food so i was doubly sceptical about indian food in holland but the food here was deliciou 
i was here with my family for my birthday. the food was quite good but not extraordinary. there is not a lot of space in the establishment which makes it feel crowded easily as the tables are very close to each othe 
"have been more than once to india gate restaurant. very small place located in a shopping street which could easily be overlooked. once inside notice different atmosphere, thanks to typical lightgreen, indian music and welcome by hosts. the restaurant is a narrow but deep space crammed with tables. and it seems to be always full. so advise to make a reservation if you can. there is hardly a waiting area if you would decide to try and wait for a table to come free. besides most people go here for a long dinner-evening. so many authentic indian dishes to choose from and ranging from mild to strong spiced. you can always ask for suggestions and ask to temper with spices on request. to me the best indian food restaurant in town."
stuffed ourselves and somehow the bill was under 50eur! biryani and dopiaza were excellent. ill go back.
great place to sit and enjoy the jewels of india. no hurries and no worries. kitchen and serving staff can offer advice on what to enjoy and how hot the dishes are.
"over the course of a year i get to stay approx. 3-4 times in the nijmegen area. i discovered india gate some years back and they also were the reason why i started my indian restaurant tour, when on business travel in europe thing initial "
india gate is the indian restaurant in nijmegen. each item is freshly prepared and delicious. there are many regional choices: tandoori with naan or roumali roti...lassis for a refreshing drink...and lots more. namaste!

"india gate is a wonderful restaurant, the hostess really connects with you, makes sure you have all you need and the cook prepares exactly what you ask in the most tastefull mann "
"on a recent business trip to nijmegen, i went for indian food with 6 colleagues, some of who had been previously. the waitress remembered a few of my colleagues and mixed a special dish for them..she customised the dishes to suit everyones palat..starters to share very good, but the main course was fabulous..nan breads also deserve special mention.. will definitely return when in nijmegen again"
we were at this place a few months ago but i did not have the time to write something on tripadviso 
"i went to this restaurant several time and every time was a unique experience. the owners are beautiful persons and they serve everything with elegance. the dishes are adjosted a little bit to the dutch taste but they are very good, all of them. definitely one of the best places to have dinner in nijmegen."
"india gate is the only decent curry in nijmegen.  its a bit pricey if youre used to british curry place, but as its the only game in town..well..there you go.  the naan bread cant be missed, and the service is spot on."
my family loves indian food. in 30years we never had better food than at indian gate. the service is great as the atmosphere. so try there excellent food.
the oldest and by far the best indianfoodplace in town.for people who love spiced or not spiced food. dishes are serverd with basmati or nan.
"i used to work close to nijmegen a long time ago and india gate was my favourite restaurant at the time. just recently i had the chance to return and to my great surprise nothing had changed! still the same excellent menu (prices had gone up a little) and service but to my astonishment the lady proprietor actually remembered my name! had a memorable evening, great food, service and fun. just a shame that its far from where i live. highly recommended...."
"very friendly hostess, remembers your name and/or knows that you come more often. my wife has an allergy for peanuts and the hostess remembers always that my wife has an allegy of some kind, it is for the kitchen no problem to prepare food if there is somebody in youre group with any kind of aller "
"excellent quality food, a very comprehensive choice of dishes to suit all tastes be they hot and spicy or something to suit the milder palate. excellent and friendly staff"
"i remember this excellent restaurant from years ago, and remember it was always supe "
"our hotel recommended india gate. the food was good, but service is slow. i would agree with other reviews that there is a difference in how they appear to treat tourists. we had one of the combo dinners and it was a lot of food for two people. it had just the right amount of heat. the place was very busy with take-out order. given how small it is i guess locals would rather get food to go."
"the best indian restaurant in the netherlands, and better than all indian restaurants i visited in the uk and singapor "
"we had a delicious meal in this small restaurant. we went without a reservation, around 20.00 hrs on a friday night and luckily there was a table available. i think only because the university holiday started i think, better reserve when you want to  "
we booked at table when passing on the afternoon - we were glad we did as it was busy when we went at 20:00 for dinner. very authentic indian food. staff were happy to adjust recipes based on taste & preference. lamb melted in our mouths in the 2 dishes we ordered as did the chicken in another dish. 
"this is a very nice small restaurant with friendly indian staff. even though i usually only go there once every few months, they know my face and the food is very nice. once you have made a choice from the menu, they immediately offer poppadums and 3 sauces. i have never had to wait very long for my dinner which is just the way i like it."
nice place quite close to the center of nijmegen. the staff is very friendly and food is simply delicious! the interior is nothing special tho
"we have been going to india gate for close to 20 years now, and still love it! excellent food ranging from mild to hot (vindaloo); naturally, great vegetarian options, too. very friendly and knowledgable indian staff that speaks english and dutch fluently and will remember you. nicely decorated, fairly small and intimate, indian music in the background. just go for a main course - youll feel stuffed, trust me! drink mango juice or lassi, which combines much better with indian food than wine or beer (just my personal opinion). guests: many indian business people and regulars. a friend of ours, who has visited india about 50 times by now, told us this is the best indian restaurant in the netherlands!! i.e.: great value, very affordable! enjoy!!"
"if you like indian food, this is a good place to go. the food is excellent, the service great and the hostess very nice."
the balti tika masala and rogan josh were phenomenal.  i highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.
"i visit the city a lot on business so looked around and this restaurant was recommended the food was very good and the waiter was very helpful with the menu, a little expensive but it was worth it i will definitely return aga "
"found myself in nijmengen for the night and after consulting tripadvisor found the indian gate. very nice indian food, plenty to eat and very good quality. would recommend and puts some uk indian restaurants in the shade. quite expensive by uk standards but was a nice treat."
we had a great french fries and kip saut√© sauce on them and two lovely salades with roasted goat cheese!
the food was excellent and the people very friendly. we enjoyed our stay in this small village and certainly the restaurant
"what a find, gem of a pla "
nice and friendly staff. food is great and made with love and passion. nice icecream as well! homemade.  also a great place to stop for a drink or lunch while bycling the mergelland route .
"good beer selection, great variety of food and amazing service fom all of the servers.  the staff even went out of their way to make my wifes gluten-free choices very easy.  highly recommended location if you are in the area."
"nice spicy food, restaurant isn‚Äôt anything special. we had enough to eat but not to much. we had a pleasant experience."
"great variety of vegetarian dishess. i took garlic nam as starter and panner tikka masala. was amazing the spice, paprika and coconut with indian cheese marinated. i wil come back for sure."
"delicious vegetarian dishes, accompanied with salted- and mango lassi. nice and subtle spicing. they are also very flexible (for example, minor changes in the menu). everything is prepared fresh so it will take a while before it is served. very friendly lady serving us."
"this restaurant has got it all, good service, low prices and high quality fo "
"we came to enjoy dinner with family, and to start the manager make us feel very welcome, the restaurant is great, the quality of the food is top, cant miss the woks that can be made with shrimps or beef and all fresh veggies, the employes are all over the place , making sure everybody feel attendet and for one price you can have all you can eat.... simply delicious..."
"love the buffet from around the world!! food from europe to asia. the meat is fantastic and the quality of fresh food is great. love the idea of paying for your dining time rather than food items! if you are taking the kids make sure to get them to eat their main meal before they get to the deserts! one day we will go and just have dessert and no main meals as the choice is outstanding. very clean, great staff and good food. all in all a perfect place to eat and enjoy time with friends or family."
"came here for an evening with family and i have to say i was very impressed, not only with the layout and decor of the building (including the great bathrooms) but the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the service was amazing, the food tasted absolutely delicious, i would definitely come back here if i visit agai "
"we have eaten here sveral times, usually as part of a larger group of friends and always find the choice and freshness of food to be of a high standard, not always found in similar types of establishment. plenty of chinese, malaysian, thai and japanese varieties as well as pizzas and european dishes for those who do not like the spicier dishes. good teppenyaki grill and fresh wok cooking as well. can seat 100s!"
very cozy place if u want to try one of the best know  chines dishes then you should come here this is best quality
"we went there four friends in the end of a really long and good day - we didnt really have many expectations. when we first got there we were greeted by the extremely friendly staff - the price seemed high at first - but when we got to pick our dinner we realized how many options we had. all kinds of meat and vegetables and the experienced chefs prepare it right in front of you. all drinks and desserts are already paid for when you enter, so you can drink and eat as much as you wa "
me and my friends ate here and were extremely pleasantly surprised. the food was excellent and the staff even more so. very pleasant experience and the atmosphere were very nice and relaxin 
"as awe have dietary needs (shes vegetarian, both gluten-free and i am dairy-intolerant, we are a challenge to any jrestaurant. here we were welcomed with a smile, given a personal waitress to guide us through the buffet and the food was fresh, tasty and more than enough. definitely jthe best option we had in the area"
"fantastic good quality food, huge choice, very friendly, professional and attentive staff, clean, and great value for money. enough parking nearby,"
this wok restaurant is very good. youtube van choose different chinese food. tepanyaki grill pizza. dutch food. icecream desertbuffet etc etc
"we went ti this chinese restaurant today with our friends who live nearby. i can honestly say that i have never been to a chinese restaurant like this one. the rich decor instantly appealed, the extremely happy and kind reception staff made us feel so welcome . then we discovered that even though we paid a fixed price for a smogasboard, it entitled us to :- select anything we chose, even to having steaks including kangaroo, prawns, different fish etc all cooked especially for you. the range of different nations dishes was amazing and the deserts were to die for. the wait staff were diligent and always happy........i want to recommend this restaurant to everyone!"
a lovely spot for lunch al fresco; friendly staff who like a little dutch style joke and are happy to serve away. a light snack was just what was required and the apple pie desert was to die for - it became the benchmark for the rest of our netherlands tour - top class.
"clean, friendly and with enough greek atmosphere to make one feel one might be on holiday. good choice of food and drink.  excellent! we shall be coming back again and again and again..."
this is a very good restaurant. the food is authentic greek.  the staff is very friendly and the owner is very good host.
"even if the restaurant has only a dutch menu, the owner speaks english very well and can kindly suggest you the best of greek food. our dinner was good and tasty. i hope to come back soon."
we arrived just as the kitchen was closing (8pm which is quite early) but they agreed to feed  
a busy terrace. the waiter was very helpful and nice. my partner ordered biologisch beer which was excellent. chardonnay and bottled water was ordered. it was very peaceful on the terrace. the dishes served to our neighbours looked very well presented and appetitizing. we would have ordered lunch but had another appointment. definitely worth a visit.
"it was very good. i think that foto was enough. atmosphere was nice. staff was helpful, they ask all the time that everything is ok.  i recommend"
"my son booked high tea (or afternoon tea, as it is known in the uk) as a treat for me - and what a fabulous treat it was! we had a superb selection of savouries, pastries and cakes - all beautifully presented, and washed down with a selection of teas and a glass of prosecco. the service was spot-on too. 5 stars all the way!"
"the menu here is very typical, including croquettes, omelettes, pancakes, burgers, and a chicken sate dish. we had the latter too, and both were well portioned and quite decent quality wise. the main gripe we had was that the burger was extremely well-done, to the point of being a bit dry. with quality meat and a thick burger like that i would expect it medium, but at a minimum not d "
have visited this excellent restaurant on all of our frequent visits to leerdam and have always found the food to be excellent in choice and quality. friendly service and seasonal menus are always interesting!
"have you ever tried a glas menu? no?! then, you should try it in the restaurant t veerhuy "
"impromptu visit to t veerhuijs, wanted to take the family and some friends for some traditional dutch pancak "
"this is a very nice restaurant, helpful service and a good place to rest after a nice long walk or ride along the river linge."
"calm, relax place to a nice and warm meal. nice staff, good dinner and an vegetarian option that was very tasty!"
"booked for around 6pm, arrived 6.45pm. warm, welcoming and pleasant atmosphere. welcomed and served by anais, excellent waitress. wines very good, menu extensive and reasonably priced, i had two wild platter (venison and wild boar platter) portions more than adequate, plated exquisitely, enjoyed meal very much and so did my friends theirs. would highly recommend this lovely restaurant in leerdam, and leerdam too, known for its specialist glass ware. "
nice lunch place in old leerdam. the service was friendly quick and correct. i had a ni√ßoise salad and the tuna on it was freshly grilled and perfectly cooked. i was impressed so a big compliment to the chef. my friend had a goal cheese salad which was also very nice and well prepared. 
the 25 euro for the three course glas menu is a good choise. it gives good value for your money. the haeted terras is a
"charming place with nice vieuw. nice menu with great food. looks nice, taste even more!  good price/quality balanceüëç. perfect place to combine shopping in the mainstreet and finishing with a great dinner or lunch. also attractive pancakes for kids."
"we arrived a the restaurant and the menus were all in dutch. the waiter was pleasant, polite and offered to translate as necessary. the food was fast and tasty. loads of locals having lunch which was a great tell. would recommend it for lunch, snacks and coffees"
"very good traditional dutch cuisine and great value. very busy restaurant, brasserie style, quick friendly service staff all seemed to speak good english and the menu was varied, not too extensive and the desserts were delicious. a real find."
"we tried this restaurant as an alternative to our hotels excellent restaurant and were not disappointed. after studying the extensive menu (all in dutch so some interpretation is needed ) we had the set 3 course asparagus menu. well presented, full of taste, and filling, along with a carafe of house red, our meal was a most pleasant experienc "
"we spotted this restaurant when we were exploring this magnificent town. it looks great from the outside with a corner pub and an outside marquee attached. we opted for the outside marquee with wall heaters. unfortunately they dont do an english menu and their menu is quite extensive and uniquely dutch. however we got the very friendly and good english speaking waiter to explain things in detail. the food was magnificient and unique and delivered quite quickly really. the heaters can be a bit too hot if you are sitting under them. also be warned if you have a credit/debit card whether it be visa/american express or anything like that, most places in this town dont take them including this restaurant, so be sure to carry plenty of cash on you. you could quite literally come back to this place over a series of a month and get something different everyday from this menu that you like."
"dropped in because i was stuck in traffic, this happens a lot in the netherlands, and was immediately seated although they were bu "
"i visited this one lunchtime. it is a traditional dutch building with a conservatory style extension. the staff were pleasant, welcoming and spoke good englis "
"as far as chinese food is concerned, there arent many choices here in makkum. just the one. so, if in makkum i strongly suggest giving it a try. three of us went there for dinner, i had a large beer and the special #40 something (shrimp and frog legs). the shrimp were large and tasty. the frog legs were a bit small, but served their purpose. altogether the meal had a lot of flavors with the vegetables and spices. i would go again, but i would try a different entree. with a large beer and entree my meal totalled ‚Ç¨24.90, a bit pricey for what i am used to getting back in the states. a good meal, but i could eat cheaper elsewhere. if youre craving chinese, definitely go. if youre penny (euro) pinching, stay away. "
"we had a late dinner here and found it to be a nice experience. we were made to feel welcome right from the start and the menu was explained to us as we don‚Äôt understand dutch. i had the vegetarian special, a falafel wrap, and my partner had chicken skewers. it was all very nice and nicely presented by friendly staff. we would really recommend this restaura "
we arrived too early for the dinner menu but wished for a heartier repast than lunch. the staff agreed to cook us dinner and the bbq ribs were outstanding.   a great location beside a busy lick dating back to 1606.   highly recommended.
beautiful views from the restaurant with delicious food ay moderate prices. rooms are mediocre but the hotel beach is an excellent place to kitesurf... just be careful for all the windsurfers and restrictions applied at different times of the year.
"the ice cream is delicious, the different cone flavours make it even better, the home-made cakes are also really good, the lovely girls helping you are patient and have always a smile."
breakfast was simple and lovely. my son enjoyed his sandwich and my latte macchiato was delicious. very fair prices!
"it is ok√© you are in italy. delicious and it is all homemade. so many flavors, difficult to choose. addicted to the yoghurt/orange."
"hostfull, very good capucho, ice varietis huge and very tasty! this is the place, how to relax and discuss your for business encounters in private over a good cup of coffee! on a lovely summer evening the place is packed with customers!"
"we got light snacks for a family of four, for example, 4 (2 scoops) ice-cream, and two brownies but we got it only within 7 euros (city tax included)! they offer both outsides and inside seating preference within the complex and overall, we think its worth the money!"
"we came across this small tearoom in the strange shopping mall in amstelveen when looking for pet food. the restaurant is located in the kostverlorenhof, a small shopping mall with some good restauran "
"this little gem is definitely worth visiting! homemade gelato and chocolate plus a really great coffee to go with it! even though they lack good outdoor seating, they make up for it in excellent quality gelato. this place definitely beats da vinci‚Äôs and it is way less crowde "
"suddenly feels like eating ice cream and tried subzero gelato just because it is right in front of me while passing by.. and surprisingly turn out to be one of the best gelato i ever got in my life :d no jokes and no exaggeration!!! they even have gelato with matcha flavor and taste excellent too! all classic flavor are great! pistachio, raisin, coffee, and caramel salt.."
"we were passing by in the car one day and noticed this cafe had just recently opened. so we gave it a go. i have to say this place is great, the coffee is excellent plus their cakes are delicious my partner has the dadel cake and i have either the carrot cake or the red velvet and all are delicious and light. the ice creams too look amazing and are made on the premises. see ya soon"
attempt for quality is the prime effort of this new company beyond any dou 
this place is a great addition to the shopping centre with very tasty icecream! we often go to italy and this is good quality ice. you can also take out a box of 1 liter and this makes a good impression at a friends dinner if you bring it. we go there almost every day for a walk and a nice dessert.
the food was delicious and authen 
"we went there on a saturday evening with no expectations at all. we sat down at 17.00. it was obviously too early for this place, cause we were the only guests. we ordered some starters, the borani and a type of tzaziki were delicious. at around 19.00 the restaurant was totally full and the party started. service was slow but we had so much fun, we didn‚Äôt min "
"we went with our non-iranian colleagues. the food was great and on saturday nights they have live traditional and pop persian music which makes it very authentic to iranian restaurants. although we found the music a bit too loud. the staff are friendly and the kebab and stew dishes are very good. they serve a complimentary and tasty soup as well as berry juice at first. very stylish and nice if you want to go with work colleagues etc. prices are okay, more on the expensive side."
"cyrus de grote was recommended by a business contact and i have eaten there twice since it opened. the food is delicious, genuine persian cuisine and the staff is as warm and friendly as youd expe "
"great food, great setvice, great cocktails recommended persian restaurant in amatelveen. even persian khoroshts each week day!!"
the great and joyful experience in a persian (iranian) restaurant outside of iranüëåüèºdelicious food and good music. sometimes live music
amazing food. splendid ambience. personal service by the host. made our night. must visit if in the area or desire good authentic pakistani food in amsterdam
this is the best indian and pakistani restuarant which remind you your childhood flavour or you feel taste like home made food.
went with friends to this new restaurant they have the buffet very nice tasty indian food with lot of vriety soup.salads bbq mwar and veg currys and sweets
a grote pannenkoek is plenty for 2 for to take home  which i do.  the umbrellas are necessary this year as plenty of sunshine
on a lovely day its nice to sit outside at a table either sunny or under an umbrella. the spek pannenkoek  is as good as i remembered.
"great place, friendly staff and excellent pancakes. fresh teas (mint and ginger) also to be recommended. found this place on tripadvisor and don‚Äôt regret coming"
last day of our holiday and stop off on the way to the airport. our 2 pancakes were the best we had on this visit to the netherlands with plenty of filling. if have a small appetite then ask for a small pancake. the staff were very pleasant and the service was excellent. the restaurant can become very busy when the shops are open so plan your visit.
"the pancakes in this restaurant are unusual: two thin pancakes on top of each other. we had one with nutella (a lot of nutella!!!) which was very tasty. great! we had another pancake with bacon. very unusual because the bacon was baked separately and put in-between the two pancakes. by not baking the bacon together with the pancake, the taste is less than with the usual dutch pancake where the bacon and pancake are made together. the good point is though that the pancake is less fatty. so all in all a good experience. the service was good and the place serves tap water. prices are normal."
really good pancackes! and very good service! how it should be. friendly people who work  there and know how to do there job! you feel welcome and looked after.
"this is a great place. the workers are so friendly, the location is perfect, best pancakes ive ever had in my life. thanks for existing."
"the place has very nice and a wide variety of vietnamese food. it is really close to our house so we often go and order lunch there since it is delicious! not only the pho is amazing but also the curry and the lemongrass sandwich is definitely worth a try! i strongly recommend trying saigon at least once it is really good and has a very wide variety of food to choose from. we also have the membership card for this chain of restaurants which also including kyoto sushi make a very good mixture to get discounts in both places at the same time. the staff is also much friendlier now than it used to be. i see there are some very bad reviews about the staff there being quite cold and not apprehensive which is actually true but now the people working there are much friendlier, a bit slow though sometimes but they are much better ( i remember there used to be a lady who was complaining all the time and seemed quite unhappy with her job ) fortunately not like it used to be anymore. also i see people complaining about the pho being really hot, well it is actually what pho is, it is a soup and it is supposed to be served cold, you just need to wait for a bit and it will cool down. we will for sure go back very often."
"one of my favorite places for lunch. the lunch deals are actually awesome value for money. soup, sate and springroles are some of my favorites. the vietnamese ice coffee is such a treat!"
"it is so far the best asian restaurant.my husband and i always visit amstelveen for shopping or eating dinner.we had tried few restaurants,but this is so far the best.i had the viatnamese salad with chicken,prawn and beef.it was really good.highly recommended for summer.it has a good portion and very fresh.my avocado shake was also really good.my husband had the stir fry rice with prawn also full of flavor.they also had a good and fast service! i will surely recommendüëå"
"had a great lunch with my wife there. the food was excellent, it was served quickly and it was really good tasting. i loved the pho myself, and the meals were very acceptably priced. service was good, quick and friendly. the restaurant was full, and with mostly people of an asian background. this usually is a good sign for the quality of the food and the authenticity. my wife and i loved it!"
the restaurant serves authentic asian food which leaves your taste buds satisfied :)  i had amazing pork curry .. and still relish the taste and tenderness . must try .
"the farm is a great place for a relaxed day out and you can even feed the deer while youre there. if youre feeling hungry, their pancakes are really tasty and 1 per person is plenty to feel pretty full afterwards."
wow what an amazing place hidden in the forest. great pancakes.  lovely for families with childrens play areas and goats to feed.
this place around since 1857.   nice coffee offerings.   the pancakes are delicious and large enough to share.   a little off the beaten path but worth the effort.   counter type service but super friendly people.   reasonable prices.
"a friend brought us here and recommended they had good pancakes, there was 45 minutes for pancake but was worth it, pancakes were good. the area is good for children they have a playground but they ask children also order meals not just drinks"
"back in 2015 i lived in amsterdam and often went to the amazing amsterdamse bos ..my ex bf helped me to discover this place and i often came back since then....it s a beautiful spot into nature with some animals and a lot of seats to rest and enjoy the sourrandings! they are a self service restaurant if you need it or just a pancake spot,they have a wide .. i mean...wide choice of pancakes and the design inside is just pure beautiness!!! looks like an old farm full of vintage things!! so so nice,more than reccomended!!"
"a piece of history that hasnt changed.   tasty food and friendly service. i would recommend this place especially if you love pancakes.   there are also animals such as deers, peacocks and even a pony."
"this place seems a little remote and a bit difficult t get to without local knowledge and a bike.none the less it was packed. waffles waffles wafffles, all sorts. all very tasty i am sure. after the waffle a good bike ride back to amsterdam is essential to work off the calories."
"situated in amsterdam bos this a perfect place to take the kids and enjoy a great pancake . huge choice of tasty savoury and sweet pancakes in a very child friendly environment. after you have enjoyed your pancake there is lots to do for the whole family . enjoy the animals that live just outside the restaurant, go for a walk or a bike ride and even go for a swim in the lake . you can spend the whole day enjoying the outdoors at bos and you wont go hungry with this great pancake house close at hand ."
loved the farm! came across it by chance on the end of a long bike ride out of the dam. great buffet with crepes and sandwiches at reasonable prices lovely settting too on a sunny early summers day. loads of space and easy and quick service. very nice.
"lovely location within a forest with plenty of walking and bike trails. the restaurant is a former farm house with seating both inside and out. these are dutch pancakes which are delicious. many selections including plain, apple, and bacon, with either powdered sugar or cinnamon sprinkled on top. this is a self service restaurant. the prices are a bit hi "
this place was beautiful. it‚Äôs a nice stroll to get there and totally worth it. the pancakes were delicious. the best i have ever had. will 100% return if i am ever in amsterdam again.
"nice and authentic pancake restaurant located in a traditional farm house. a wide selection of affordable pancakes and fast service. i expected to be served at this restaurant, but apart from the pancake, all other food and beverages has to be picked up on a tray."
"very nice location in beautiful park , and tasty and huge pancakes)) i recommend with  apple whipped cream and cinnamonüëçüèª"
"we visited here with two small children and had a great time. there is a play area for the children where you can sit and watch them while enjoying your meal. i recommend sunscreen as the area is not shaded for the children. the pancakes were delicious, but we ordered four and ended up taking two home with us. one would have been enough for our two children. very good service and friendly staff. good for families. "
"the restaurant was quiet when i visited (because of the time of the year). the service was good and the cheese/ginger pancake was excellent. it is not indicated inside the restaurant, but please note that it is basically a self-service restaurant."
"no only is there an excellent selection, this is also a great place for kids parties. you can also organise a walk/tour for the kids with a bos wachter (forest ranger) before you meal. he will point out lots of wild life. my kids really enjoyed it"
just went there with the kids and had a small pan cake. really good and the surrounding was nice. the only negative thing is the planes fly over very very low. the rest is oke
"in the middle of the forest, greate place to have a lunch with your family. vast choice of pancakes with all possible flavours from jam to tomato with cheese, cherries, and much more. outside seating creates a great eating experience."
"plenty of pancake choice from savoury to sweet. suggest two people share two pancakes, one savoury and one sweet, so you wont drown in one flavour, and sit outside in the court yard."
"i have been here twice in one week and love the pancakes!! the farm is hidden in the forest which gives it a great quiet atmosphere. love biking in the area and grab a pancake as we got hungry. both tried savory and sweet, the cheese bacon and the apple are both to be recommended! even though it was 30 degrees outside the service was super friendly! look forward visiting this place soon again. "
"lovely outing for sunday, you can cycle (or walk) up to the boerderij meerzicht. we arrived just after midday, ordered our pancakes. as i already had several cakes this weekend, i went for savoury: vegetables, cheese and onion. there is plenty of choice for toppings: lots of fruit!"
great pancakes! in the middle of the park! with peacocks and reindeer! great place to  stop and hang out!
"this place has some animals, massive playground and many other things for kids. you can easily spend here a couple of hours. pancakes are ok + you have other standard dutch options (sandwiches, apple pie, etc). the place is huge, probably 200 seats inside and outside"
"we went on a sunday morning and by 1030 it was busy, and by 1130 it was packed. opens at 10, but dutch pancakes (pannenkoeken) were not available until 11. you can get coffee, espresso drinks, sodas, juice, and pastry before 11. order pancakes at the cashier after you go through the buffet to get pastry and drinks. we found the savory pancakes with cheese to be our favorite, but of course the plain with powdered sugar and the sweet/fruity ones were amazing, too. we have 3 smaller kids (9, 8, 6 years-old) and we had leftovers with 3 pancakes, so they are not small!"
awesome   this is our second time visiting but it was the first time that we could be able to get some food from here.
"this is an old farmhouse in th amsterdam forest, close to the rowing la "
this place is nicely situated in the amsterdam forest park both accessible by bike as well as car. you can relax and enjoy a pancake from their well-organized kitchen. the children can enjoy themself outside in the playground or with some animals. as parents you can relax and easily keep an eye on the kids as there is only one way out and no dangers.
"along with a friend we went for a walk in the park near the rowing centre, and looked for this farm/restaurant to have pancake "
my girlfriend and i were staying at the steingenberger airport hotel and decided to take a walk through amsterdamse bos since it was a short walk away from our hotel. we stumbled across boerderij meerzicht by chance and were sure glad of  
"after a tiring hike in the park or the rope park on the other side, this is a perfect place to sit back, relax and enjoy wonderful and tasty(and interesting) pancakes. they have a very good selection of salads and sandwiches. kids loved this place as the place had deers, peacock and kids could feed the deers! would highly recommend this place for its offbeat location, great food and family fun!"
"they make all sorts of crazy pancakes as you like- sweet, salty or both. they are exceptionally delicio "
"love this place, has to be the best pancakes by far!!!  huge selections.  in door out door seating, with play park for kids.  great day in the amsterdam bos!"
"love this pancake house in the forest! 100s of different flavours and toppings to choose from, lovely seating inside and out and great lil farm animals and play area for kids!"
"went here yesterday (28/5) and we had a pancake with bacon and cheese, the other apple and cheese. both are ‚Ç¨ 8,20 really really good. (i told the pancake baker!). for the kids theres a playground outside!"
healthy walk from the entry of amsterdamse bos approx. 4 km. when we reached the place it was right time to order fo 
"place was busy. it was sunday. had to wait an hour, but the pancakes were fabulous. it should have an estimated waiting time. the drinks or soft drinks were very dear, eg ‚Ç¨2:20 for a small bottle of fanta. and you pay for the toilet. very child and pet friendly. "
"this restaurant is so unique to a person from the states. it is situated out in the middle of a forest;-- parking is quite a distance from the front door. before you enter this family oriented restaurant, there is large playground for the kids to work up an appetite; there is a petting zoo present on the grounds as well a beautiful peacocks roaming the ground of the restaurant. there is quite a selection of old tractors present before you enter the front door that makes the art deco quite interesting. once entering this very large area restaurant, you go to the counter to place your food and drink order. they have menus in both english and dutch. we chose to go all the way to back of the restaurant so we wouldnt bother other guests. you have to get you bread and drink order at the self-service counter and you order your pancakes with the cashier. it is important to note they only have one kitchen but they always use clean utensils when preparing food for people on gluten free diets or have food allergies. they have a large list of pancakes on their menu. i had the bacon, pineapple, ginger pancake and my husband had the cheese and tomato sauce pancake. both pancakes were huge and out of this world. you only need one pancake to fill you up. the restaurants serves all kinds of coffees, hot chocolate, irish coffees, juices and mineral water "
"the location is in the green area, amsterdamse bos. its not only a pancake restaurant but its also a place where you can bring your kids too. there is a play ground for the kids and also seeing deer. a lot of choice of pancakes"
"i took my family for a cycle through the forest, they begun to feel the pang of hunger - and id heard storied about a pancake house in the middle of the forest. we found a bustling, lively place - filled with laughing children playing in the park and looking at the animals and in the centre, a dark wood ornate restaurant serving stacks of the biggest pancakes eve "
its my the best pancake place that i have been to. i like the chocolate pancake the best. its great for travelers  enjoy
"if you love pancakes, it is a must visit place with so many different options. the restaurant itself is in the middle of amsterdamse bos gardens so it makes it really beautiful amidst the woods. there are few domestic animals and peacocks roaming around. nice playing area for kids. definitely one can plan a picnic to the woods with some delicious pancakes"
"good pancakes, and a nice variety of sandwiches, snacks and desserts. if you call ahead you can even get pancakes for specialty diets (i.e gluten free . "
"on first impression, this boerderij is just another tourist place in the amsterdamse bos. however, don‚Äôt be put off. not only has this restaurant got the fine art of serving a vast number of customers sorted, but the food is also very good. we particularly like the pancakes here, as they are some of the best in amsterdam (and, yes, we have tried all of the top rated places in the centre and beyond). the meerzicht has plenty of room so if you are a couple or alone, you can get away from the excellent play area and the mountain of kids. however, if you do have kids, this is a great place. our 5 year old never wants to leav "
"if we hadnt rented bikes and been told about this place, a stopping point in our 26 km ride, wed never have known about it. we took the long way around so our lunch came with few kilometers to go and we could relax outside. upon arrival by bike, you can park your bike on the side where there is plenty of room to park bikes, then go inside to where you pick up a tray, find beverages, etc. and order from a long, long list of sweet or savory pancakes. they give you a plastic pager so you can go find a table until your pancakes are ready. we had a beautiful sunny day so ate outside in the garden. each of us had a savory pancake, then we shared a sweet one afterwards! great place. go if you can!"
"we had a very pleasant surprise in finally going there. pancakes are good and the place is great for children ! tips: order the pancakes at the counter / kassa directly. then give your bill to the kitchen, and dont forget to take in return a bipper, which will turn red once the pancakes are ready (we had to wait only 10 minutes). also, the place is only 2 minutes from the nieuw meer, which you can cross in taking the boat for 1 euro per person and 0.5 cents per bike - only from 15th of april to october from 11.00 to 17.00 on saturdays and from 12.00 on sundays. anyhow, great place, good pancakes and plenty of seats, so you dont need to wait. "
the pancakes are delicious and the selection is huge. they have a beautiful garden in the summer and warmer days and its great just sitting out to enjoy a few pancakes. the bacon with maple syrup is one of their most popular and was delicious. we also tried some fruity ones which were equally really good. if you go to the amsterdam forest then this is s must stop!
"nice old converted farm with some animals and plenty of play areas for children. food is ok, average priced. plenty of seating in & outside and nice farmy atmosphere. main attraction is that its very handy if you are spending time in the amsterdamse bos/goat farm or just a lunch destination with children."
i have gone to the pancake house numerous of times and will be visiting it again in the near future. the atmosphere is great being in the centre of the forest. plenty of outdoor/indoor seating. lots of choice on the pancake menu. perfect place for family outings as there are a lot of animals nearby to keep the kids entertained and a massive play are 
"this place is in the middle of amsterdamse bos, a great green area between amsterdam and amstelveen. to get in the restaurant is already a nice experience, since there are other restaurants in the park, but this one is in its hea "
"wonderfully situated in the amsterdamse bos its a great place to end a walk in the woods. they have a wonderful playground, big terrace outside, and looks like an old farm. very wide variety of the big flat pancakes, with all sorts of toppi "
"a beautiful place in the middle of amsterdam wood. a place of warmth, large sweet pancakes during the long cold days pf winter and early spring and a joyful colorful playground outside for the kids with many animals as well, so the experience is both in and outside. the inn itself has a lot of collections: animals, birds, dishes and plates and many curiosities which make the place a true delight to be there for children and adults alike. i have visited the place for 3 times and enjoyed it each time!!"
"this pancake house is right in the middle of the forest amsterdamse bos. its very popular with local families and their children. they have seating in side and outside and even though it usually very busy during spring and summer, there always seem to be tables available. they serve a large variety of pancakes and they are good. adjacent theres a playground for the kids to enjoy. weve been going to this place for many,many years and its still a treat."
the boerderij meerzicht has a wonderful old fashioned atmosphere. it gives you a true old dutch feeling. the pancakes or pannekoeken as the dutch call them are very tasty. you can watch them make your own special pancake. the menu is diverse with many pancake toppings to choose from. we enjoyed our eating out there.
"we rode our bikes from amsterdam city along the river then along tree-lined paths until we reached the amsterdam bos (forest). the ride we took was about 8 km one way. we all really deserved a pancake after that ride! the boerderij meerzicht seats about 300 people - either inside the pancake bakery or outside under the trees. the pancakes were just divine. we would recommend the bacon, cheese and pineapple one for a savoury experience, but the pancake to die for was the chocolate one. mmmmmm- mmmmmm yum "
most authentic and tasty indian food. great service and good atmosphere. true to the multicuisine concept and caters to all tastebuds!
really good food og servic 
"great food, fresh and tasty,always fully booked,  but thanks stuff for helping us to find table and enjoy our meals and holidays üòÄ"
"absolutely amazing place to visit for your dinner, tasty food, friendly stuff, i would highly recommended"
"excellent indian restaurant with a lot of south indian cuisines. loved the panipuri, kothuporotta, and the chicken(hyderabadi) and lamb biriyanis(awadi). it is located in a shopping center. nice staff and less waiting time. their rose and badam milk shakes were great."
arrived on a busy friday evening at 7:30pm without a reservation and the restaurant was full. made me a booking for 9pm. 
"it was a delightful experience having authentic indian dishes at tummy treats ! just reading the names of maharashtrian dishes like kolhapuri chicken , malvani curry made us feel so warm "
this experience was completely unexpected. meeting friends who live in amstelveen after years. alka and ankur took us to tummy tre 
"after many experiences which were decent enough around amsterdam, we found this relatively small place with fantastic indian food. as opposed to other restaurants serving cliche menus, tummy treats really offers a journey around india and a lot of rather unique dishes for the local dining stage "
i went with my partner to have onam sadhya at tummy treats and it was just delicious! you could taste that it was prepared with a lot of attention by the chef (raja - he is not only very friendly but clearly also very skilled!). we loved the meal and look forward to returning to this restaurant!
best indian multicuisine restaurant in amstelveen and in netherlands. variety of dishes from all regions of india. authe
"unbelievable! best tandoori dishes i have eaten in netherlands for over 20 years. chicken thigh meat pure meat no onions and capsican peppers. charred en spiced the way it should be. i am not a fan of biryani but the vegetable biryani was delightfull!! and most importantly an indian restaurant which serves southern indian food as well as streetfood. never came across an indian restaurant which serves idli sambar, panu puri and all variaties of indian style pancakes. just a great place!"
"this is an absolute gem of a restaurant! amazing and delicious food, coupled with excellent service. would highly recommend this place!"
i know there are lot of indian restaurants but there are not many restaurants which serve the south indian flavo 
the last view weeks we ordered delivery from  the italiaan restaurants in amstelveen area that deliver to our home and this one is the winner. tasty pasta and well made pizza. only negative is that the delivery took long but it was worthwhile the wait.
"we were staying across the road whilst on a rugby and whilst helping heineken boost its annual turnover we got a little peckish. this was a little gem of a place, great food and was happy to customise pizzas to accommodate our british pallet. really friendly staff and great food give it go. the waiter asked if we wanted garlic on the pizza, boy did we get it. made a good pizza in to a fabulous one !!!!"
"the atmosphere and food are very good.  staff is friendly and the child friendly. pizza, pastas, entrees with many choices.  quality of food and level of flavor has always been high."
"we enjoyed the food here, its very italian, tasty and very reasonably priced. pastas are good, meat as well."
"i wanted to go for a while now since i saw their menu. they have dishes which you won‚Äôt often find here in the netherlands. they have a lot of choice. i took the takoyaki and okonomiyaki, two of my favorite dishes! i like that they have a lot of options on the okonomiyaki and it was really good! maybe a bit pricey, but i certainly found it worth it."
a nice little japanese restaurant focusing on ramen soup. had a warm welcome on a cold and rainy night and a very good fukushima ramen soup with some yaki gyoza and draft kirin. it actually became the highlight of the day and now will be returning to my hotel with a good memory. 
upon entering you are welcomed by authentic small japanese restaurant type with loads of japanese manga to read. great food choises and tastes very good. recommended for any occasion.
"its the first time for me to visit here. i really think the best japanese restaurant in europe. very comfortable, very tasty. i wanna come here every day but unfortunately my visit is based on business trip from london "
"full of japanese clients.  japanese waiter (dutch chef, curiously).  not cheap, but worth it i guess for the food.  simple decor."
the closest to japan it could be in area of amsterdam . very nice food with all traditional stuff from all over japan.from ramen to fried octopus balls and japanese draft beer. lunch and dinner. but they are closed between 15.30 -17.00 o‚Äôclock. friendly stuff and delicious food. 
"if youre looking for your ramen fix, this is the place to get it. probably the best ramen you can get in the amsterdam/amstelveen area! side dishes are excellent too. i have tried the teriyaki salmon and the gyoza, both delicio "
"went here again for lunch and the service was good, nice people and good food. what do you want more. the range of ramen dishes was good and the speed of service also. all in all a good place to have some nice japanese food worth the trip!"
"we (family with two children) had a lunch here. during lunch there is limited menu available, but well enough choices and beautiful option "
"my boyfriend and i came to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday. to our delight, the atmosphere is informal and 100% japanese (i‚Äôve been to japan and my boyfriend lived there) and there are shelves full of mangas on the walls, so while waiting we briefly flipped through the pages of some comics (they have a lot of classics, so kudos for this); the staff is all japanese and most of the customers t "
"i went yesterday night for dinner with friends to this cute family-run restaurant. a quite authentic small restaurant. they do not prepare sushi and it is not a fancy expensive restaurant. they offer ramen, friend noodles, japanese omelettes "
"the restaurant offers a nice and casual atmosphere. the front wall is lined with bookshelves full of japanese comic books to browse through. during the time of our visit, about half of the guests there were japanese, which is usually a good sign as it indicates authentici "
"authentic japanese food, the gyu don (beef rice bowl) and ramen noodles is very good. i have a pleasure time here."
local place cater for amstelveen japanese community. same like ramen places in japan  but cost twice. yet good to go for ramen and curry.
"the food is simple yet good. ramen tasted as expected. although it is a relatively small restaurant, the quantity of dishes on the menu is very large. perhaps too large, because the staff/kitchen seemed to have a bit of problem to get all the orders ready on time during a busy saturday evening. we had to wait 30+ minutes for a bowl of ramen and the staff mixed up the orders frequently. whether it was due too the busy evening or because some of the staff were new, we dont know. we will definitely visit again to see if it was a one-time fluke or n "
"rather basic looking cafeteria, but oh so authentic japanese dishes. dont come here for a romantic evening or go looking for fancy sushi or teppanyaki here, but enjoy sitting in the midst of japanese expats and eat what they eat. super friendly service, as one would expect."
standard service but the noodles are very good.  i always get the tan tan noodles and i have yet to be disappointed.  very satisfying place to eat.
"from noodles to rice and okonomiyaki, i never had difficulties to choose from the menu, well, there is just too much to choose from for one meal!!!! i have recommended to many friends who like japanese food, and it does attract local japanese customers every single da "

"little small restaurant in amstelveen, the food was nice i have enjoyed.  you sit pretty comfortable, but its very busy."
"one of the few places in and around amsterdam where you can have some real tonkotsu ramen. the thick broth is packed with flavor and the pork is amazingly tender. you can order extra pork or extra noodles in case of bigger appetite. the menu offers a few other styles of ramen and lots of other dishes: fried chicken, fried noodles, rice dishes, gyoza, salads and okonomiyaki! ps: the latter takes around 30mins to prepa "
authentic japanese food with very friendly staff! the ramen is very good. also they explain everything to us. will come back again!
it is a nice and cosy restaurant run by japanese in amstelveen just a couple of minutes walk from the tram /metro stati 
"we were the only not japanese people in the restaurant, which makes me think that food is traditional and authentic.  all our dishes were amazing:  salads,  wontons, ton katsu, okono-miyaki.  i truly recommend."
"nice place, almost like a japanese neighbourhood living room, complete with magazines and other things to re "
"everything feels like japan in this place, the cook, the food, the client√®le. okinomiaki and other japanese homecooking are the way to go. food is value for money"

"we had a lovely dinner there. the atmosphere was very calm and comforting. the food was absolutely delicious, we ordered the chicken bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap (both are recommended). the waiter was very friendly, and he gave us recommendations (that we did order and really liked) and descriptions of the dishes. next time we come to the netherlands, were definitely coming back :)"
it was a lovely dinner experience with friends where we ordered bibimbap but with extra beef bulgogi with it. it was very delicious served in a hot stone bow 
"we had very good korean dinner here. very good food and tasty. very friendly waiters, and she can speak koreanüòä we had fried chicken pieces in korean style for starter, and it‚Äôs very good. also pork bulgogi with onion in chili sauce(recommend), you can choose with chicken too. we‚Äôre absolutely coming back again üòäthe best korean restaurant in townüòä"
nice atmosphere and great food. try the hotpot and the sake i tried out some korean restaurants in amsterdam but this one is far better
"great korean restaurant, also serving korean drinks. the food was amazing and they are very popular among koreans in the area which is always a great sign! highly recommended!"
lovely korean food for a decent price. especially the bulgogi was great. there were several korean business people when we ate there
"happened on this restaurant as it was close to our hotel. we had classic bipimbap, bulgogi and some nice insamul. kids want to come back tomorrow- that‚Äôs the best review you can get! authentic korean food and very friendly staff."
we had the surprise menu as i hadnt had korean food before so didnt know what to order. it was all delicious and prepared fresh. very friendly and helpful staff.
"damso was just smashing! the food is full of flavor and the spicy food really packs a punch (as advertised). additionally the korean bbq is far superior to other bbqs ive had, the meat is full of flavor and so rich that i struggled to finish everything (which is a compliment). service was fantastic, the young girl serving us was very sweet and treated us lovel "
been here a couple of times of the past years. i always leave satisfied. everything tastes good. my korean friends do agree. try the korean bbq.
"reserved a table for 3. restaurant not too busy, simple decoration. most of their guest were korean. food is good, especially the crab-pancakes. and the dipsauce was yummy. the dumplings and the chicken(korean style) was ok. but the dak kang djong was very good. bimbimbap was alright, the side dishes were a bit on the small side for three. but general was good. the service is a bit slow, had to call everytime for drink orders and she didnt cleared any empty glasses or bottles from the table. missing some hospitality. "
"we were eager to have hot asian food after taking some pictures of the tulips in the spring rain. excited to have found this on g-map and soon confirmed we were right when we saw authentic koreans running this cozy restaurant near amstelveen. choices on the lunch menu are not abundant but it covered all i could recall for a good korean meal: bim bim ba stone-bowl stirred rice, kimchi pancake, soup chilly tofu, soup noodle, etc. most of the customers spoke either korean or japanese, only a couple of dutch. atmosphere was casual and friendly, as the restaurants name suggests: friendly chat, which makes you want to stay longer after the meal. we waited but not too long for the stone bowl rice which was really nice in the cool spring noon. ingredients are very fresh and nicely presented. kimchi pancake is nice but not particularly unforgettable type. staff is more like family business style and do not expect very flattering service. maybe you need to be a little proactive, to remind your ordered drinks or prickles etc. price is fair for eating in a decent restaurant like damso in ams. will come back when i miss bim bim ba."
"delicious korean food, many choose on the menu. good value for lunch set and not too expensive for dinner as well. causal place. smelling a bit of table next to you order bbq meat. great place if you like korean quality food."
"buzzing korean restaurant with plenty of choices. we had a jellyfish salad starter, which proved to be quite different than imagined and very nice. then we shared a korean beef grill, which was fun and very tasty, and a spicy chicken and rice dish, which was hot! this came with plenty of yummy sides, so we left sated but keen to return. excellent service. "
my husband and i have now lived in amsterdam for 7 months and still have been on the hunt for a good authentic korean restaurant - now weve found  
"the first impression stepping into the restaurant it is not the best one ever, but the food is delicious. it was our first time with korean food and we liked it. everything is fresh and with good portions. mind only that they have only chopsticks for eating ;)"
"damso is a very nice small restaurant in amstelveen. we enjoy both - a cozy, friendly atmosphere and very good korean meals they ser "
"coming here regularly, traditional korean restaurant. food is very good, service is very friendly. i had tried half from the menu and all is good. dont look for the cozy or romantic atmosphere, its a simple restaurant and the value is all about food. they are open for lunch then re-open for dinn "
"this small restaurant in amstelveen is a bit like a home away from home, always full of locals (ie korean guests), which is always a good sign. food is fabulous and service very friendly, we always go there as family and are never disappointed. reservations are highly recommended. "
this restaurant is a gem because it is one of the few places in the netherlands where you can get authentic korean food. not suitable for people who dont like spicy food or dont like kimchi and other heavy tasting cabages. especially recommended for a bit larger group of people since in this case you can sample from the very many authentic korean dishes. see my pictures for some of the delicacies we tasted the last time i was there. for drinks i recommend the soju barley wine and the corn tea.
dont bother the interior but the food is all well. always a very nice welcome by the hosts. just a lovely resto.
"small cozy korean restaurant located in the old part of amstelveen. this restaurant serves some nice traditional authentic dishes. staff is nice and helpful if you have difficulty making a choice. various side dishes, like kimchi, will be served with the main cour "
if you are in search of a good korean restaurant in the amsterdam area then just go to amstelveen and eat at damso! food is very authentic and tasty with all the traditional bbq dishes rice dishes and kimchi. the atmosphere is casual so no need to dress up. and there are koreans working there which is nice to know. definitely go and you will get. nice meal! 
tastes of the foods in damso are really like the original. especially mandoo is really good.
the limoncello ice/gelato can not be beat.  street parking only so keep hunting for a spot.  lines are long on the sunny days
you can see long queues on a weekend inspite of the corona sca 
"its famous , its good, its deserves a visit   its a great experience with an open sitting area and yeah free parking"
ice cream is gre 
the place is very nice and offers a variety of tasty ice cream. my family loves it so much and we are frequently there.
"this is the hot spot for ice cream in amstelveen. in spring, summer and autumn this place is crowded with visitors of all ages who enjoy the many flavors of this authentic italian delight."
"slightly out of your usual way, da vinci offers generous portions of ice-cream. they have so many flavours that it is best to orientate yourself first online before cycling down to the lindelaan. the salon has a good selection of both sorbet and milk based flavours and - good news for those allergic to milk - a lactose free pure chocolate ice crea "
"if you love a perfect chocolate sundae, order this place‚Äôs superlative dame blanche.  consistently rewarding!  would go outta my way to enjoy one here."
the very best ice cream i have had in a very long time.  and their espresso is also a must.  the choice of flavours is huge and it‚Äôs all fresh right in front of you.
every summer we visit the ijssalon da vinci... it is the best in town and serves very innovative flavors which you don‚Äôt get at other place. very authentic gelato - home made and served fresh.
the gelato is really good and authentic. portions are large and priced fairly. good selection of flavors. overall definitely worth a visit!
there is so much to choose from that it takes some time to decide on the flavour. be ready for a long queue in a warm summer afternoon or evening but it is worth it!
it a nice spot in a convenient location. good ice cream lots of flavours that you would expect from italian ice cream. but for something south american try patagonias in the same neighborhood.
real fresh and smooth icecream. regularly new and innovatieve flavours. open in summer untill 22:00! it‚Äôs absolutely worth visiting.
the icecream is amazing quallity!!! good prices. they also have coffee. i recommend the flavour  kinder bueno.
"lovely ice, good taste, friendly staff.  now and then a bit crowded, but that ‚Äòs because they‚Äôre so succesfull.  worth a visit"
on a warm summer day head over for a gelato or ice cream. while there is always a line this is a locals favorite. parking once again is street parking and a bit of a challenge. yes there will be a line but get in it and have a memorable icy treat. there are outdoor tables and no one will rush you to finish.
"all lot of choice, friendly people behind the counter, you can sit inside and outside that says enough :-)"
"this place has a continuous stream of visitors on a sunny day, a rainy day and even quite late at night . this can only mean one thing : it is good . it is simply an ice cream parlour that makes on the premises and sells to eat there and then, grab a cone and go or even buy 1/2 litre to disappear and eat in secret . the flavours range from traditional to typical dutch to just plain lovely and ones you have never tried before. a must visit ."
"great ice cream ! love the cheese cake ice cream. dont like the whip cream, but luckily you do not have to add that ;-) easy to park your car in front. also next door is a great barbershop, jan bartels."
"this shop makes his own ice cream in lots of strange, but great tastes. like oreo/vanilla or white chocolate. grandmas cookies or cookie dough with grapes....so for every tast there is a variety of ice creams."
this the best ice cream parlor in amstelveen and vicinity. we live in amsterdam and even make the trip out of town to this place. so much better than all the prefab ice cream places in amsterdam. worth a detour!
i live near the place! the ice cream is great there! you should visit it! they sell things that no other ice cream shop offers!
"often i come to the hairdresser jan bartels, the best guy in amstelveen. i expected a long line for his services. no, it is the neighbor: da vinci icecream parler. in one word wonderful genuine ice cream for a decent price. unfortunately closed during the winter, but i cant wait for the spring to coem. go there!!!"
excellent ice cream and sorbets. ambiance is good. service is ok. a lot of real italian flavors. great spot. the place to be in summer !
"whatever ice cream you want, they have it. huge assortment of all kind of ice. expect a cue when its warm."
"our benchmark is pistach/ pistacchio. i eat that all over the globe. if i leave most gelaterie in rome, palau, salerno, napoli, pesaro, milano etc etc out of competition than da vinci has made the dramatic quantum leap to the first place in amsterdam ( sorry pisa, you were our favorite) of the netherlands, munich, london, new york, barcellona. "
"nice selection of flavours, friendly personnel, always busy. love to visit the place after dinner! recommend."
"does what it says on the tin. great tasting ice creams in a nice parlour . we just has double cones one a hot day , busy but found a space to sit easily. good value"
people know italian ice cream is famoes. da vinci ice-cream parloer is absolutely one of the best  i know. young women and men serve you well. you can get a lot of different tastes.
"best ice cream in amstelveen. not open the whole year, usually they close beging october and open again in march. really good ice cream and not even expensiv "
its the best ice cream in amstelveen. they have various kind of ice cream. and every time they make some special flavour. and its home made. everyday fresh ice cream. and always busy during summer time. be ready to wait üòâ
"we love the shop. all kinds of flavors, they the classics ones and new/experimental ones. they have now pokemon ice!  it is always busy. but they work hard so you never have to wait long."
"we live around the corner from this place so we go here every week. however, this review is not positive because of the proximity. even compared to top ice cream parlours in italy, da vinci holds its ground and is better than most of what we have tasted over there. they regularly change up their flavours and experiment with new ones. but they never forget their classics and consistently stay at the top of ice cream parlours in the amsterdam area for sure. come and try it out yourself!"
dont let the simple looks and the location of this very good italian restaurant hold you back to visit this very good italian food restaurant. the high quality justifies largely the slightly above average prices. it looks like an ice cream parlor but it is also a restaurant. friendly service and original italian food from the old school.
"nice spot, busy on sunny days, but never a really long wait. long enough for us to choose between all the tempting flavors.  worth a small detour. but not extremely different from many other quality italian ice cream shops."
great choices of flavours and all very yummy! visit this place quite regualrly and always lovely ice cream. love the snickers and bueno flavour!
amazing choices of ice cream. i loved the pistachio flavor. but you could also get some more creative flavors. english speaking staff. all very friendly.
"super nice and delicious gelato! usually there are small queues here in summer. quite some variety, very good prices and great quality gelato."
all i can say is: try it for yourself! this shop has some wonderful italian flavored icecreams. kids will love the blue flavored smurf ice cream. shop has indoor and outdoor seats depending on the weather. once youve tried you will be back for more!
"we tried davinci recently as our favorite icecream shop has closed. we were in for quite a surprise! there are many great flavors to choose from, with a new favorite for me: toffee fleur de sel. we ordered an orea ice cream cake for my daughters birthday party, which was great too. the top had a chocolate icing which had a bit of a strange texture, but overall everyone thought it was a hit. we will definitely go back."
plenty of flavours to choose from and on sunny days you will have to queue up. really good ice cream.
"i am originally from amsterdam and i used to go to an ice cream parlor in amsterdam-south which i still believe has the best ice cream i ever had as they use fresh fruit in their ice creams. but ijssalon da vinci comes close though. i took my three grandsons (age 15,14 and 10) here for an ice cream. and living in the usa (chicago area) they are supposedly connaisseurs with regard to ice cream. they have tried virtually all brands of ice creams in the usa, both when visiting ice cream parlors (dairy queen, baskin robbins, you name it) as well as ice cream brands from the freezers in various super markets. and they rated ijssalon da vinci very high, so i guess this is a good recommendation. try and judge for yourself. enjoy!"
i dont know what ijssalon da vinci do but whatever it is it is good. the best icecream i have ever had no matter which flavour you pick it is always good. when i used to life in amstelveen in summer time i would stop by here at least once a week.
"good taste of the different flavours, we tried melon, monchou, greek yoghurt with passion fruit and strawberry cheese cake. great value for money in comparison to the other italian ice cream places!"
"judging by the often long queues, one expects somthing special and, while the ice cream is generally good, it isnt quite top ... and some flavours disappoint, such as the pistachio.  nevertheless, not bad for a cheerful ice cream parlour in a periferial amstelveen neighbourhood."
da vinci has great italian ice cream. lovely tastes. its a bit on the outskirts of amstelveen but definitely a reason to drive a few kilometers more. try the oreo taste of bitterkoekjes.
"the ice cream is so good and diverse that the place is so popular you almost always have to queue, even 22.00hrs. if it is a sunny day and you find yourself in the neighbourhood it is definitely worth a visit !!"
"da vinci has a wonderful selection of great ice cream. period. yes, you may encounter long lines on sunny days, but its worth the wait."
this is the best italian ice-cream place in town. wide range of flavors to choose from and very tasty ice-cream.
"not expensive, loads of flavours.  has an american sort of attempt about it (apart from the staff, of course).  outdoor seating available."
"we werent overly hungry but knew we didnt have anything to eat in the house, so we kept an eye out for somewhere on our way home. i would have driven past it, thinking it was a pub, but then spotted the name. we popped in and had some very tasty tapas - a fish and a meat platter. we all had our favourite bishes, but really they were all very good. the two dishes filled up two adults and a teenager, but like i said we had been nibbling all day. i would happily go back for the same, or try anything else on the me "
on a bright day after a tough cycle against the wind this charming and friendly bistro fuelled me for the next leg of the trip. as a solo diner there was just the right amount of friendly interaction with the team. the cheese and tomato toasty was much more than that. the coffee was excellent too. the church nearby is a masterpiece.
"the biefstuk was great, really well made coupled with an excellent tomato soup and terrific tostadas"
driving along one of the main routes out of amsterdam area and there was a traffic jam so my friend who is dutch found an alternative route and we drove through this small village and decided to stop for dinne 
"we went to this place on a sunny late afternoon and used a local supermarkets two-for-one deals. we were greeted by a very friendly waitress who was a delight all the way through. we ordered wine and beer and were immediately offered bread and butter spread. the starters were quite good, albeit not too spicy. the mains were nicely presented and were quite tasty, the gambas could have been cooked a bit less, other than that it was a nice meal. as a desert we had an apple pie in which tortillas were used as layers, a funny twi "
"the location is lovely and very peaceful.  the staff is kind and helpful. the ribs my boyfriend had were excellent. i would rate the steak i had as average, however it was plated up and presented very nicely."
"so bad, reading the comments of someones before me. with even just lies in it. well, of course, they have toilets. and very clean on "
chose to eat here when staying nearby. never had an indonesian before but the menu had english and restaurant had tables. staff were immediately friendly and the food was excellent. good value too as lots of food.
"...at typically inflated amsterdam/-lveen prices. nice setting though and friendly service, if a bit slow to come and take (and remember) our order with a full house. bereft of indonesian cuisine in tallinn, estonia where i live, i took my go-to dish of chicken satay, which was nicely cooked and very flavourful without being too heavy or oily. it was served with some lovely, slightly sticky rice. sides were pickled everything, which were nice. the noodle, rice and beef dishes my fellow diners had were all enjoyed, as were the mixed vegetables with coconut. overall a pleasant dining experience which came to about ‚Ç¨35 a head including drinks (soft drinks/beer only). clearly popular, even on a sunday night - we got the last available table, which just happened to be available, so you may be better off booking if you really want to try the place."
i returned a year later to this excellent restaurant and the owner recognised me and greeted me like a long lost frie 
when it comes to lemon grass i have mixed opinions about it. overall its good ambiance with indonesian dishes to choose from. perhaps good for a visit.
"we had an indonesian rijsttafel for 2 which was delicious! we ordered sat√© kambing extra and that was better than ive ever had in the past. really good, genuinly indonesian food. the staff was very friendly and helpful and took excellent care of us! certainly a place we will go back to!"
"my friends and i did not really order anythig in particular, we let patron pick dishes hed like to share with us....and that worked wonders. indonesian cuisine has a history in the netherlands, but this place is real outstanding."
"an indonesian friend organized this outing for around 10 of us. instead of having to choose from the menu, we had arranged for the kitchen to just feed us! what a great decision. dish and dish after dish of stunning indonesian food just kept coming. our indonesian friend confirmed that this was the real deal. the service was superlative. however average this place looks like from the outside, i cant recommend it highly enough. a wonderful experience enjoyed by our whole party. also great value for money - huge meal, drinks, dessert, at under 30 eur per head."
had dinner here with my marine corps friend and we always like to eat some indonesian food. i am borne and raised in indonesia so i know what indonesian food should be li 
very good food and service.  the rijsttafel is the most delicious indonesian food i have ever tasted.
"my wife, who is from holland, and i have been coming to holland almost every year for 45 years to visit very good friends and her family. we love indonesian rijstafel, so our friends suggested we try lemongrass. it was an excellent recommendation. lemongrass is a very modern and fairly small restaurant, recommend reservations. the service was very good. our party of five all had mini rijstafels and we all enjoyed the food very much. looking to eat here again when we return next september."
visited the restaurant quite a few times now since it opened. the the rijsttafel lemon grass is always good. if you go with friends 3 times rijsttafel is more than enough for four persons. so go and have a nice dinner!!
"we used to eat rijsttafel in amsterdam, but service and quality just went down too much recently. lemon grass is exactly what we were looking for: very tasty food nicely presented by friendly waiters. as a bonus, it was much cheaper than in amsterdam, but thats not what we were looking for, it was quality we were after and with that we were more than happy."
"we booked on line and enjoyed a very good meal on a busy saturday night in early jan. we ordered the lemon grass reistafel which for 3 of us provided more food than we could finish , and a variety of dishes ( about 10) with 3 side dishes with different levels of spiciness . the service was pleasant , but as mentioned in other reviews the dining area is quite small but i think the price reflects th "
"first time here but i enjoyed it very much. this is a small place that can hold some 35 people or so. as this is a small place the tables are a bit close to each other but it is still ok. nice utensils and linen napkins are on the table. we started with some complimentary prawn crackers and indonesian beer (bintang). the menu has a variety of dishes with chicken, lamb, beef and fish so there is choice for everyone. we started with the pangsit goreng (5) which is a deep fried wonton filled with a prawn/chicken filling and udang goreng (2) which is a large deep fried shrimp. very nice. for mains we had the spicy dengdeng blado which is a dried spicy beef with lots of ginger and in a nice hot oily sauce. really enjoyed this with the white rice. the other main dish was the ajam panggang which is a grilled chicked that really gives you some charcoal flavors. to add some more taste to it we added the atjar tjampur which is sweet and sour vegetables. it was a good experience and it would probably be good to make reservations before you go. by the time we finished our meal the place was full."
"we had diner here because all other restaurants we tried were full. in this small restaurant we got a friendly reception (also our little dog was welcome). we had babi ketjap and sajoer lodeh. both were very good. as desert we had the tjendol, which we did not like since the green sustance tasted nasty floury. although we did not like the tjendol, the rest was so good that we will come back lateron."
one of the joys of visiting the netherlands is the opportunity to sample indonesian cuisine and our dutch hosts recommended this restaura 
we recently went here with frien 
"located in the stationsstraat, in the oude dorp (former center of amstelveen) this is a different kind of indonesian restaurant: not a toko with take-away but a true restaurant. tasty, affordable dishes and friendly staff. will definitely return and warmly recommend it!"
"excellent quality food and service in tasteful modern-design-ish atmosphere. especially nice broad choice of different rijsttafel dishes. we combined two smaller ones with some starters which allowed a very nice palette of tastes. service was perfect, attentive but not intrusive, food came quick, a jar of water was served without asking. perfect dining highly recommended."
"had an amazing rice taffel which although a dutch invention is something i love for sharing with family. lemon grass amstelveen do a 16 dish delight with a wonderful mix of sweet, sour, spicy, salty, savoury dishes with soya, prawns, fish, chicken, lamb and beef as well a vegetarian version. they even had a kids menu. it was a wonderful combination and the food and rice kept coming. certainly no one went hungry that night. the waitress was attentive, helpful and accommodating for our party of 15 people and there were no grumbles on the tale. highly recommend it!"
this is a great little place. nice food and good sized portions.  limited drinks menu but that was ok for this type of place.
"we were just back from a wonderful vacation in indonesia and already yearning for some authentic fare. i heard from a friend that this place served good food so decided to give it a shot. wasnt disappointed, great food and service. the restaurant is tiny so suggest reserving ahead just to be safe."
"in the past it was a thai restaurant therefore the name and interior however the food is authentic indonesian, not like the chinese indonesian rijsttafel. we enjoyed with a big group of friends a whole range of dishes and each had that nice oriental aroma. the taste is good and you could ask if you wanted it more spicier the original way. try it out and ‚Äúselamat makan‚Äù."
"great little family run vegetarian restaurant specializing in pizza and pasta, kosher.  we had pasta and salads and they were fresh and tasty. service and staff very professional but at the same time they make you feel like family."
i ate several times in pizza&co. the pizzas are very tasty and both greek and tuna salads are excellent and fresh. good pleasant atmosphere and you can sit both inside and on the nice terrace. highly recommended and certainly worth a visit.
"came here for both of our lunches while in amsterdam. pizza was outstanding...personal margaritas. limited seating, but great option for a quick lunch.  fries good as well."
"this isnt the worlds best kosher pizza. but its tasty, not too expensive and easy to get to. we took the metro and walked about 10 minutes. there are a few tables, but when we got there we were told that a big group was on the way in and wed have to eat elsewhere. that was fine because there are lovely benches outside."
small kosher pizza shop located a small shopping area beneath apartment houses. pizza is sold by the pie not by the slice. only few tables.
we always enjoy the delicious pizza and chips friendly service and served quickly easy to find took a tram and bus from centraal station and it‚Äôs kosher which helped me
"a great kosher pizza place in the middle of amstelveen - good pizza with all the topings included and fair price, very homey and not-too-much-israeli vibe to it, you can approach the owners in hebrew if thats your thing in kosher places but they much prefer english or dutch."
we really enjoy pizza. taste was good and fresh ingredients. they do also falafel and fries so really its a nice place if you wanna avoid your typical restaurant. they also serve desserts. kashrus its ok chalav isroel.
"me and my wife enjoyed the great food there. we werent expecting too much from a kosher place, since usualy, kosher food abroad is more expensive, but not realy good compare to resturants in israel with similar price range. but this one cought us by surprise. reasonable prices and a very dellicious pizza. also, i got falafel, with was good too, but the pizza was the highlight for me."
"when i wrote my review in 2018 i couldn‚Äôt expect that i would only visit again in 2023, however we were pleasantly surprised with food being even better than in 2018. the flavours of the dishes were absolutely wonderful. the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala were delicious. our next visit will not take as long as last time."
"the indian kitchen is an awesome indian restaurant. it has good ambience, very smiling and hard-working staff. the staff specially nidhi has been extremely professional yet friendly. the food is quite apt and reminds you of the great indian taste. for me this place is a great place to bond with my colleagues, customer and of course, my family. it feels at home outside home and you will not miss india, away from india. the entire dining experience is quite aweso "
"the food was excellent and the service was exquisite. the ambiance was good.  we found this on trip advisor, and we were not disappointed."
"some of the best indian food ive eaten, and i do eat it often! i live abroad, but i visit the netherlands regularly, and the indian kitchen has quickly become a regular must every time. just be careful on the spicy! it is really spicy. luckily the kind waitress was smart enough to suggest going for medium and not hot... i thought i could take it! great food, nice place, good service!"
"in a casual and comfortable but stylish environment (love the art and imported wood panels), this is the best indian cuisine i have had in a long time if not ever! every dish was perfectly executed, authentic and well seasoned, hot and fresh to the table; specifically the butter chicken and samosas were absolutely divine. and the service was not just friendly but really on top of it as well. great family restaurant but solid for clients and business associates too. "
the food is amazing! best indian restaurant! service was also very good! it is a must visit indian restaurant!
"very nice food, excellent service. spicy or less spicy, just how you like it, just tell them how you want it. been here more than once, will surely come back."
"visited this restaurant again last night for the first time since the pandemic and had another great experience! we had samosa, onion bhaji and these great little chicken stuffed naan breads to start. i could just eat the little naan breads all da "
"authentic place and music, friendly staff, great beer but most importantly the food was amazing. probably the best indian food i ever had."
"great variety of food, prepared in an excellent way. the service is impeccable and it had a great separate bar and outside terrace"
"everything was excellent and service was great we tried biriani , prawns, chicken curry. very friendly staff. we highly recommend"
we have travelled and we have eaten. and then we came here... the bar has been rais 
great food and lovely atmosphere. would visit more often if we lived nearer to amstelveen. highly recommend you give this place a try.
the indian kitchen has a lovely ambiance with a large tv screen rolling beautiful photos of india. the food served was excellent. the staff was very friendly and the food was out in a very reasonable time. a great place to host your guests! will certainly eat here again.
"our dinner was amazing and all of the food was excellent. the service was great and so was the atmosphere. if you want to eat indian in amsterdam, this is definitely the place to go!"
we went for a dinner after making a reservati 
"i was at indian kitchen last night and it was - yet again - a really lovely meal. we had lamb tikka and an amazing potato and paneer stuffed pepper to start. then we had chicken tikka, a prawn biriani and a lovely cauliflower side di "
"been here now a couple of times for dinner and its good quality every time weve been here. service is quick. you make a reservation online and this way you also dont need to fill out forms when you arrive. hand disinfecting gel at the door before you go in and all seating areas are shielded off from each other. joyful starters such as the spicy chicken wings and samosas. main dishes will be prepared from mild, medium and hot but if you ask for scorching hot they will make it to your liking. all dishes we have had over time are really well done and tasteful. whatever is left you just take home. as a nice closer we typically have the old monk which is the indian rum that is really good. we try to go here every week and well keep doing it!!"
"lovely food! it was al perfect.. servis and food matches the quality üëåüèºüëåüèº recommended for sure, very friendly staff"
"highly recommended! the food is excellent quality, the staff is super friendly and the ambiance/decor is lovely. on top of that the price is very reasonable! all in all a great restaurant."
ambience : 4/5 food : 5/5 service : 4.5/5 taste : 5/5  authentic indian food. must try murg haddiwala
"great indian food with authentic flavours. a lot of options, all nice. the restaurant itself is nicely decorated with dark colors and indian artistic pieces. outside a big terrace. location is al little of the grid, but worth going. highly recommended."
great bengal food. their hyderabab lamb biryani is top. tandoori prepared dishes are top. excellent service.
"a beautiful restaurant that brings you diffrent tastes of india. they give high service and high quality food. good for eating with the family, friends or after work!"
i have been to both indian kitchen restaurant and indian street food several ti 
"the kitchen is my favorite indian restaurant in amstelveen.. the hospitality of manu, prateeksha, vishal & rest of the staff is great. food is not oily, prepared well & tastes well too. don‚Äôt worry about a delhi belly!! after 5 years in nl & numerous visits to this place... it feels like an extended home when i visit. "
the atmosphere is welcoming. the interior very nice and elegant. the food is delicious. we are always happy to have dinner here.
great choice and not an absurd portion size that guilts you into finishing as with a lot of other indian restaurants. butter  chicken was awesome and
"we already been here a few times, we like the variety of the the menu, although onion-bhaji is not on the menu, you can still order it as a shared starter, this combined with each a main-course is usually enough for us. the staff is friendly, but sometimes a bit to young to have proper horeca experience. the cocktails are really good, however it takes very very long to make them, which is a real pitty. be aware if you don‚Äôt like cold wind, then avoid sitting next to the kitchendoor or under the aircounit. but for the taste of india this is a must go! "
"modern interior design though very tasteful dishes as i could experience. excellent tikka lamb, loved the rice. be mindful medium spicy is truly spicy for taste buds if one is an occasional  indian food eater. found the bottle of water truly expensive (5 euro)."
a vast variety of delicious indian food. good place for family dinners.   vegetarians also have a vast variety of dishes to order from.
very authentic tasting indian food served in a fairly modern manner and setting. depth of flavour and fresh herbs very present. service prompt and pleasant. would go out of my way to return.
the food service was quite fast and good. the served food were fresh and tasty. we had a good time here. the ambiance was also quite pleasing. recommended !
"although the restaurant is located in a very standard amstelveen street, that is forgotten the moment you step through the doo "
"very good, tasty food with fresh ingredients, which i always enjoy, served by friendly staff and for reasonable price.  you will taste the original kitchen from india in a restaurant with a good atmosphere. cheers"
the restaurant is packed. the food is fantastic and authentic. the restaurant is having the north indian modern vibe. seats are comfortable.
"love it, love it, love it. fantastic staff, friendly management, kind and polite.  on top of that, food is really great. tasty, well seasoned and portions are solid regardles if you have in the restaurant or take away -  always best quality. strongly recomend!!!"
"the service is great, the food is tasty and the cocktails go down smoothly. careful with the spicy options. this is not western st "
been here with my indian family and ate delicious authentic tasting indian food. best chicken tikka masala with naan i ate outside india and finaly it truely was spicecy and real indian taste. the daal and paneer was also excellent. we will come again soon!!
"the three of us ate here twice in one week. yes, it is that good! authentic menu with quite the selection. we enjoyed a few street food appetizers before getting into the traditional dishes of the home. between the two nights we had the following entr√©es lamb rogan josh, chicken bariami, chicken butter dish, prawns, tandoori chicken, lots of basmati rice and different kinds of naan. everything was served family style overheated plates. the restaurant has a full bar. the owner is quite visible and the waitresses are very attentive and pleasant plus helpful as you try to make choices between the many entr√©es. i am one of the entr√©es favorites were the lamb and the tandoori, but all were grea "
"we had a yummy meal here in early august 18. after three weeks in london, copenhagen, brugge & amsterdam was craving for indian high quality home food. the food at indian kitchen was simply amazing. yummy. finger licking. the ambience was superb , staff very friendly plus very reasonably priced too. strongly recommended. pradeep multani, new delhi. india"
"we have been eating here since the place started out as a take-away place. i am glad that their quality has stayed the same. we order from here often and also, go and dine in when we have guests that want to have indian food. the quantity in take-away is a lot more than when you eat there but the options available in the restaurant are a lot mo "
"called in after reading a comment on trip advisor had one of the best curry dishes i‚Äôve ever had , coming from yorkshire where we have some of the best curry houses in the country , i think that speaks for itself highly recommended"
we always get take away from here. it is delicious and we enjoy it every time. great flavor and the price is about the same as any amstelveen restaurant. its cheaper to take away to avoid the cost of drinks and we enjoy eating at home relaxing with this great food tasting the wonderful spices and sauces.
"we went for dinner, service was good, food tasted go "
"it is our second time at the indian kitchen, and it never disappoints. this is a sophisticated indian restaurant that could well be in amsterda "
"this is one of the best restaurants me n my husband has been too. the service is more then fast. within 20 minutes of placing order , the food is on your table. the spices and the taste is to die fo "
"one of the best indian restaurant in amsterdam(or i should say amstelveen). quality of food is great and also the ambiance. prices are very little higher when compared to other restaurants in amsterdam. but it is worth for the quality of food they serve. i have visited the restaurant couples of times(¬±6 times) and have tried almost all vegetarian dishes. the only negative point for me is that the restaurant is not in a prime location like amsterdam, so should travel to amstelveen. if you are looking for quality and taste of food, this restaurant is highly recommended."
very nice restaurant and very delicious food. i love their biryani and currys. malai tikka is really very very tasty. i would really recommend this restaurant.
"a good reason to visit amstelveen is this indian restaurant. the ambiance is very pleasant, the staff welcoming and professional and above all the food is excellent. a good reason to make a trip again for us."
very good food - both veg and non-veg.  you need a booking before you visit this place as it is booked most of the times.   be prepared to spend time as food takes some time but is worth the wait.
the food at the indian kitchen is always fantastic! 
"the restaurant looks really nice and cosy , the staff is helpful and friendl "
"very nice place, great hospitality, excellent food. place to be around amsterdam if you like indian food !"
"had a nice dinner, liked the idea that you can choose how spicy you want your curry. portion size was plenty, service was also very friendly."
all our dishes were good but more variety like salads and vegetable side dishes would be even better. service was excellent and the venue is attractive.
"we had researched an indian restaurant in this area of amsterdam where we were staying,this did not disappoint,contemporary modern,stylish surroundings and very good friendly service,dishes we had were very well spiced,and all delicious,pricing is a little high but overall a great place to visit,a great destination if you are staying in amstellveen."
the food was good. but here is what i loved about the place - superb servic 
great place to have indian food .loved the flavorful and spicy dishes along with warm and personal service. .
"although i live very close by i only recently visited this place for the first time. mainly because on the outside it does not look very appealing. however, inside it looks great! nice interior and the dimmed lights make it a cosy place. the menu is pretty long so difficult to choose. we asked for mild spicy and that was a good choice. the food was great! on the same evening there was a large group having dinner but that did not impact our service, it was quick and nice. the people only speak english and remember to bring some cash as they dont accept to pay the tip by card."
"my first time going to this restaurant although i have tried their food already for 3 years at the diwali festival in amstelveen, where they use to be one of the food providers during the festiviti "
"great atmosphere, delicious food, friendly service and a good variety.  i recommend it to meat lovers and to vegetarians  r oz"
weve been many times in the past three months and love the flavorful and spicy dishes along with warm and personal service. the kitchen will honor your requests for spice and the food always arrives sizzling hot. wonderful naan. we like their indian beer selection as well. 
"lovely food, great ambience and to top it all great service.what more can i say!! thanks for the lovely time."
"we went there for official dinner with colleagues with expectations of authenticity with indian taste. we found this restaurant to be the closest to the indian food and taste. they cooked really nice food using all possible indian masalas that you can think of and spices. off course you can ask to make it more or less spicy according to your taste and they did mix it really well. advisable to book in advance to avoid waiting else you can always walk in. they have nice seating arrangements but fact of it being in amstelveen, it gets very crowded sometimes. recommended indian restaurant."
"in residential part of amstelveen, you find this authentic good indian restaurant with modern setup. lovely interior, nice service and vibrant atmosphere."
we eat a lot of indian food and were very impressed with the quality and authentic flavours in this restaurant. we asked for our food spicy and it came with a nice amount of heat - the kind that makes you sweat but is full of flavour. the servers were surprised that we wanted spicy food and that we could eat it! i think they are used to local dutch customers who are not accustomed to spicy food. highly recommend the balti king prawns (hot) and the homemade kulfi was very good. 
"i am an indian and love indian food. after having tried so many indian restaurants in the us and europe, the indian kitchen is definitely one of the good one that stands o "
"who doesnt love indian food ? its tastey, pleasant to look at and full off spicy aromas. but finding a good indian restaurant can be a gamble. as i walked in the indian kitchen restaurant it gave me a very clean & fresh feeling , although the lightenings were a bit dim ,  its the contemporary style  i was told by a frien "
"having been to holland numerous times over the years to see my daughter, i was delighted when she told me that her and her husband had found a new indian restaurant for me to try on my latest visit last week. every time i visit the amsterdam area, i usually find an indian restaurant to try and this one did not disappoint. the food was excellent and the staff friendly and welcoming. this turned out to be one of the best curries i have had in holland and i thoroughly recommend people to try it. i certainly hope to return there sometime in the future."
"absolutely one of my top favorite indian restaurants in amsterdam and around. we eat there quite often and the food is always soooo delicious and fresh. atmosphere is nice, staff is friendly. highly recommend!"
one the better places to eat great indian food in amsterdam. we have been to many india restaurants in and around amsterdam and this is definitely one on the top. an excellent place to go out with family and friends.
"wow, the indian food at this local hangout is so extremely authentic! we really felt like being back in india. to cater to the dutch untrained tastes they serve the meals mild spicy, spicy and hot. we started with the mild version but for sure will try the spicier one next time."
"great authentic food, cozy place and welcoming personel! we recommend the meat balls and curry dishes. we look forward to be back here.."
"if you want to eat indian, just go here. fresh bread, super tasty meat and really cool place to enjoy food. a little bit pricey (avg 30 euro per person) but for the quality not really too expensive."
i have already eaten here a couple of times. the food is among the best indian food that i have eaten and the quality is consisten 
been here 2 times... we dont there is a very fine authentic restaurant near to our house .. my husband is loving it and myself too.. really good authentic indian food ... cant wait to comeback again
"what a lovely restaurant. excellent food, each dish has a distinct flavour. staff where brilliant and changed some of the menu to accommodate by british curry demands"
very tasty and authentic indian food. restaurant atmosphere invites to stay.  attentive and friendly service. everything you are looking for.
"nice decoration, good food, friendly service. it was not very crowded which was handy with small children."
"after three visits i can safely say that this is an outstanding indian restaurant, at par with the better ones in londo "
as i do not live too far from this restaurant i mainly use the take-out option. as the location is not very typical for a restaurant the flavours are very typical for authentic indian food. the decor of the restaurant is very modern and staff friendly. i have sampled most items of the menu and the food is consistently good. would recommend this place if you live nearby and do not want to go into downtown amsterdam.
"this place serves some of the best authentic indian food in noord-holland. the veggie dishes remind me of the food i grew up eating at home. service is good, and its fairly good value for mone "
"real indian for indians. i know the place for many years, since when it was a small supermarket and take away. food has always been great and consistent. you just need to ensure that you tell the chef/waiter if you want the food real indian spicy or normal. if you say nothing, the spiciness tends to be adapted to local taste"
wonderful experience. modern nice deco with separate bar area. i cannot express enough the quality of food at this place. one of the best indian restaurants i have been to. meat so tenderly cooked. rice fluffy and fragrant. awesome service as wel 
"good indian food, moderen restaurant, caters to clients who like spicy honest food, there are often many indian expats eating here, the service is sometimes slow but that is compensated by the quality of the food"
"great experience, lovely staff and good prices- by far the best indian meal i have ever eaten. the meats were very tender and tasty. i cannot speak higher of this place - i will be returning again soon."
"had a wonderful experience at the indian kitchen, the staff are very good at recommending what would best suit your tastes, they are very friendly and efficient and made me fell extremely welcome, i went for the king prawn starters (which i do in most indian restaurants) but they were perfectly spiced and very ni "
"being an indian, who grew up in amsterdam, i have long searched for a restaurant that could come close to the real indian taste. despite having visited almost every indian place in amsterdam, a few in the hague, rotterdam and in utrecht...there was none that could live up to that expectation. however, after a recent recommendation by my father, i decided to give the indian kitchen a go. the interior is very well done, an open lounge to enjoy drinks followed by cosy restaurant. the serving staff is polite and knowledgeable (compliments as not all are indian!). the service is quick and food amazing! i was amazed to taste the bhuna murgh tikka and badami murgh seekh. imagine the perfectly grilled chicken with a well balanced melange of spices...the quantity of chutneys is a point of improvement though. the main course of murgh kadaiwala and well prepared (thin!) butter naan added to the great culinary experience. i could go on and on, conclusion; definitely worth a visit! been back thrice alrea "
weve now been living in amstelveen for 6vmonths and normally go to amsterdam for indian food. yesterday tried the indian kitchen. this is pretty good indian restaurant. weve have a great butter chicken and a very tasty mutton korma. for starter we had jumbo shrimps and these we not up to the level - the shrimp was dry and had no taste. simply medioc 
stumbled upon it as was staying overnight near the airport and it is close. great service and food is delicious. highly recommend it to try if you want authentic taste of india.
"after 13 years of searching, i have finally eaten a delicious indian meal in holland. the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was very friendly and very attentive. the menu has a wide variety of choice with something for every curry lover. they even asked which spice level we would like! the food was not only presented beautifully but tasted wonderful - the perfect combination of heat and spice depth! i have come to expect in holland that the price of an indian meal is much more expensive than in the uk - this restaurant is no exception but on this occasion it was well worth it. will definitely be recommending it and making a return trip soon."
as this is hubbys favourite food we are always happy to try new indian restaur 
"so excited to have found this place so close to home. weve been going in to amsterdam for our indian fix, not knowing about this place. tonight, a friend mentioned it so we went. the place looks really nice from the outside, even nicer in the inside, the service very good and friendly, and finally, the food is some of the best ive had since moving to nl 18 months ago! my son had the tandoori chicken, my husband the chicken madras, and i the paneer makhni. all delicious. we will be returning again soon...and often!"
ordered butter chicken and garlic naan from here based on the recommendation from a friend. totally worth it. compares to the butter chickens i have had back in india. if you feel the punjabi food craving would definitely go to this place
i was there with a business associate and decided to sit in the nice & cozy lounge. we had few drinks and some tandoori items. chicken malai tikka was great!! the service was prompt and friendly! would certainly recommend for business meetings and events in addition to a quiet night out with the family :)
"we visited the restaurant on 1st jan, 2015 to embark the new year with good food. and must say it was a very pleasant dining experience. enjoyed the food thoroughly. good options for vegetarians. ambience is appealing. nice sta "
"good place to have lunch or dinner with friends or family. nice dishes, also fun menus for kids. can become crowded sometimes, so its wise to make a table reservation in advance."
"we had lunch outside on the terrace and because it was market day and the weather was beautiful, it was hard finding a table. their food is always good and reasonably priced. the staff was very busy but quick, efficient and friendly. we‚Äôll be back."
lovely lunch on the patio can not believe this weather.  the menu is still traditionally dutch and you cant beat the kroketten.  ask for mayo for the frites.
"i like popov in amstelveen centre, it‚Äôs an establishment that has been with us for years and it never fails. even when it is packed, service is quick and food served is tasty. and it is not pricy....  enjoy"
really enjoyed to have food here and friendly staff. i had a great salad and my wife had a hot chicken. both really good.
"great bar/restaurant to enjoy your lunch or your cup of coffee on the terras. situated on the square of the shopping centre in amstelveen, you can enjoy a good lunch"
for more years than i have been lunching here. first it was downstairs from my apartment. then it was just over the road from my office now i have to drive but it is still worth the trip. if the weather is nice you can people watch on the terrace. if not you can be cozy inside.
"just like the title says, the food at popov was really great and at a good price. the 3 of us had super burgers for lunch. you will be surprised of how big the plate is: large portion of fries, double burgers with veggies and an e "
"i probably eat at popov a couple of times a month. it is my go to lunch restaurant in the heart of amstelveen. the food is great, and the service unusually snappy by dutch standards. can be in and out in 20mins if you want to be."
i eat here often for lunch and im always satisfied with the food and service.  the meals are freshly made and value for money. the fresh juices are also very good!
"i have been twice to this restaurant in the last month, and both times the food was really excellent. on the second time the service was a bit slow and considering the cafe was virtually empty as it was almost 3pm, it was disappointing but did not change my very high opinion of the restaurant generally. i can recommend their goats cheese salad and both their salmon, and their pastrami club sandwiches. really top notch!"
been visiting popov every time i go to amsterdam. it is located at the amstelveen mall and very easy to locate while walking around the 
"this restaurant in the stadshart of amstelveen is always buzzing with business, probably also due to the generous portions of food you ge there for your money. the huge foodcounter makes it a little mac-donaldlike but obviously when there are always so many meals to serve it cannot be done otherwise, so the ambiance is a little bit lacking, but truth to tell we go there for food dont we?"
"food is just good - but solid, good value, reliable and ple "
"this is quite a large place, and very busy, but the staff is very efficient. go to the upstairs, it is a bit more palatable there.  the food is good: we had a focaccia goat cheese and a bun with warm meat and satay sauce."
"in between shopping we enjoyed a nice lunch at popov, they have a nice terrace where you also have some seats where the rain wont bother you üòÑ we did see something on the menu but wanted it slightly different. ham instead of salami and that was no problem at all. so they are very flexible which is a plus. the staff is very friendly and the food is very tasty. they have enough to choose from at reasonable prices. so when you are shopping here, try it and im sure youll love it too üòç"
i live a walking distance from the stadsplein amstelveen and popov restaurant is my favourite for lunch in this shopping ar 
the restaurant features authentic japanese food and the atmosphere reminds me of japan. i always enjoy coming here. there are japanese and english menus with pictures.
"the atmosphere of the restaurant is fabulous! the owner is japanese and i miss japanese cuisine so much, i can find authentic taste in nagomi restaurant! what a surprise with good service!"
the place is very cozy and modest. the food was authentic but too bad they didnt have soba noodles on the day we came. will definitely come back.
"at last a very good japanese family food restaurant discovered inside a shopping center in amstelveen. in this small restaurant they serve delicious food. we had seaweed salade, edamame, shashimi, dried tofu, tonkatsu, tempura, chicken, crocket, gyoza and miso soup. you could taste that all the food we had was made from fresh ingredients. although there were only 2 staffs the service was fast and good. we loved the food here."
we were in amstelveen to attend the cherry blossom festival and decided to have japanese dinner to complete the day with japanese culture. we were recommended to this restaurant by a japanese expat in amstelveen. so we knew it will be go 
"this place was recommended to us by a family-member, so we went with a group of seven people. the restaurant is very cosy, since its not that big and our waitress was very friendly. the menu has quite some dishes to offer, varying from noodles to small bites to meat or fish dishes. we started with some small dishes to share, the chef suggested us to try the takoyaki (little octopus-filled balls), which tasted really really good! furthermore we had some assorted tempura and lotus tempura, some deep fried chicken and some gyoza. for the main course we ordered udon and soba noodle soups. each dish proved to be very delicate and tast "
"we ordered katsudon, ramen, takoyaki and gyozo. it was really delicious. im sure we will come more often to this little place. the service was really friendly. they take the time to take your order and the food came out fast."
"went for a coffee little after 11am at sunday and the place was already almost full. the service was really nice and friendly, and the whole atmosphere was so relaxed. tasted two different cakes and both were so good, that couldn‚Äôt say which was better."
"this is the second visit we have made to this charming restaurant, with street seating too, in the last two month "
thank goodness for a quick shower or we may not have tried this caf√©! as a coeliac i have to be careful on my choice of menu but they could not have been more helpful. enjoyed the salad and the wine followed by a nice cuppa.
"after visiting an art museum in the old town of amstelveen, i went with a friend to this la gare cafe for the first ti "
as the title mentions it is the place to go to if one is looking for a lunch option where everything is organic including the coffee. i personally recommend this also to people looking for a vegan option. nice and casual. i would personally recommend the grilled vegetables and hummus.
"conveniently located within a large shopping area. seating is available both inside and out. nice selections of food for breakfast and lunch. the quiche of the day, goat cheese with eggplant and tomato was delicious. prices were reasonable and servers were friendly. would recommend for a snack or early day meal."
"nice people, simple but good dishes and drinks. nothing special and very convenient place. located in a wonderful shopping area."
"great location, reasonable prices with great quality food.  staff always very friendly.  lots of choices for all food lovers including vegetarian/vegan."
friendly staff. consistently good food. my favourite is mint team and scrambled eggs with pancetta. breads and jams are always great.
"this restaurant in the shopping mall of amstelveen provides healthy, natural but still tasty dishes. two big terraces, so always sun (when it shines) but also lots of room inside. the only negative thing is the terrible noise the climate installation produces... easy guys, fix this!"
"now to have breakfast or lunch you will never go wrong here. its decent food, slightly overpriced, fresh and high quality. good service, free internet, what more do you need. took a manhattan, salmon, fresh bread, egg breakfast, wasnt much and cheap, but tasted great."
"i love the almond croissants! having eaten many croissants and french breads finally here they actually taste like they should. pricey its not a regular place to visit but great for a treat. relaxed, friendly service makes every day feel like sunday morning."
"good food, the service is sometimes not so quick. as a vegetarian i do enjoy the variety of veggie dishes."
"we are regular visitors. friendly welcoming staff. good selection of snacks, sandwiches and food also to take away.  also serves wine."
"great menu, with range of heathy options. great gluten free bread!!! dont see this on the menu much in the netherlands and its great they have this option!"
good variety of breakfast and lunch options.  well presented and tasty food. staff very friendly.  much nicer than a starbucks.  would definitely recommend.
the food is oke and most of it is organic. the salmon with avocado where tasty. the service can be better and is a little impersonal.
this restaurant is perfect for a light healthy meal in amstelveen stadshart. its located in what is probably one of the biggest and most complete shopping malls in the netherlan 
i but especially my daughter goes here often for lunch. it is good food and the atmosphere is great and certainly a lot better than the average teenage hang-out. send your teens here.
big orange juice and a very nice omelette will be costing me about 14 euros. ..do not cheap but do far very nice.
this chain has the best food for lunch and breakfast everything taste better because its honest fo 
the major clentele of the restaurant are the visitors of the nearby fitness centres. the card shows that and offer healthy meals. we had tom kha soup (very good) and vitello tonato (cold dish presented in a carpacio format). super tender veal meat.
"found this place by accident when visiting for a volleyball game. place is nice and open; you arent squished up against other tables so it was very comfortable. service was friendly and helpful. we had kipsate and pasta and both were delicious. cappuccino was good as well. not much else to say. good food, friendly service and nice atmosphere. what else could you ask for?"
this is very nice choice if in the area. there is comfortable indoor seating and also outside seating in summer. food is consistently well prepared (i have eaten here many times) and service is good. i recommend a visit if in the area a definitely after a work-out as the cafe is inside the sports complex.
"my favorite place in amstelveen. perfect for meetings, lunch and dinners. parking is perfect and their corn kip salad is my favorite"
"i went some times during my stay in amstelveen, and all can i say is that the food is really nice. the service was also good. the portions are very good so you will never get hungry after eating he "
"we have been here a few times and it still surprise us. we came a couple of weeks ago to try the ah dinnerbon. the menu was very goid, they adapted my request for gluten free and we really enjoyed it. service was very good as well!"
popular restaurant for business lunches or diners. even have a bigger room which you can hire for a party or presentation.
it was quite a surprise to see so much flavours induced into good old salad. i had ordered prawn and chicken salad and the chef managed to find near perfect balance in making it a wholesome experience rather than a boring drag we seem to identify salads with more and a more. simply amazing.. would try the restaurant more often in future. 
"if you want to have delicious food and good service , you should try this at least once , you wont be disappointed"
"this is a good restaurant/cafe located inside the building of the health city gym. over the past few years we have eaten here from time-to-time as we live in the area and my wife is a member of the gym. the food is usually very good, particularly the range of salads they make. in summer there is a nice area outside to eat and have a drink as well. the service is speedy and efficient and generally welcoming. plus the seating is very comfortable. a good choice for a mid-week dinner or drink with a friend or partner. "
the gran cafe all sports is a good option for a light lun 
"compared to many cafes in the vicinity, this cafe has an amazingly wide spread of items on its menu....and given its a cafe addressing the audience from the gym thats even more surprising. not only is the spread big but the quality of food is great too. my favourite here used to be the ravioli in the truffle sauce which they have sadly taken off the menu and only available as a special some days...dont miss it if you catch it. they also do pretty good nasi goreng. another delight - they are open till midnight for drinks and till 10 for dinner which is quite a delight in this sleepy town :)"
ate here several times on a recent business trip to amstelveen. lovely local restaurant - in that it isnt really a tourist restaurant. my companion commented that the steak was the best hed had anywhere in the world.
this restaurant is hidden away in a residential area and not somewhere you would generally pa 
"wonderful food, everything fresh and owner and chef bart did everything to make it to our specific tastes. only tiny set-back is the noise created by the high ceilings in the joodse bruid chamber.."
the salmon we ate at the restaurant rembrandt was merely the very best i have ever tast 
"nice evening: warm welcome, well-furnished local, simple dishes well presented, good taste and good service"
what a difference a good chef makes...went a few times to rembrandt and the chef bart never disappointed me. the menu is not extensive but all dishes are very good as well as the service. a good choice of high quality wines matches the excellent cuisine. a gem in amstelveen!
great improvements were made since bart took over the place. sympathetic and great food. big groups or alone: everything is possible. love to be there.
"the menu is not extensive, but after two meals there, i can say that it is all very good.  the staff is great, and the attention to details are great.  the wine by the glass is reasonable, and of high quality."
"hidden amongst residential buildings, very tasty haute cuisine. has the tuna tartare and the dorado. both we truly perfect. decent service. will return."
"this restaurant is a bit hidden between the high buildings of the groenlaan and surroundings. it is a nice place with knowledgeable staff who are friendly and helpful when you come with a person in a wheelchair. surprisingly good food, a pity people do not seem to find this place easily. lovely inexpensive lunch menu. good place to crash and relax."
"the staff were nice, the food was good, and it had a good atmosphere.   they didnt have credit card though, so bring enough cash if you dont have a local debit card."
"we‚Äôve been several times. very tasty and reasonably priced. no seating inside, only takeaway, always busy so call early. you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"we have been here many times for take away meals, which are always very tasty. the staff provides good service. and we even have ordered here for big parties and the well prepared dishes were liked very much by all our guests."
delicious food but one piece of advice if i may be so bold. as a vegetarian i see that the meat dishes are stored at the front of the cooler. when meat is spooned from the front sometimes a piece of meat or a drop of juice may spill off the spoon into the veggie dishes. obviously spoiling the veggie food for vegetarians. may i suggest they put the veggie dishes at the front of the cabinet? 
"the food is very authentic. it is excellent and delicious. it is always fresh. towards the end of the end you may find many dishes sold out. the service is very knowledgable, friendly and to the poi "
this is more a takeaway than a restaurant but its delicious! the price is decided by weight and is not very expensive.
"this place is mostly for take out, even thought they have a couple of tablets, but totally recommended! the food is delicious. we plan to go often to buy food here."
toko madjoe has something for everyone to choose from. quality has already been mentioned by fellow reviewers acting as word of mouth for us to go ahead and try it up. however its more of take away offer with little seating to dine in.
"it is a small restaurant and take-away. the food is excellent, good value for money and very good service. there are a couple of tables, so you could also eat there."
this is a wonderful little place where you chose your rice table.  the owners serve your food in plastic containers and weigh the contents. it is a great way to experience indonesian food. food was fun.  choosing the food was entertaining. consuming it even better!
"when you want to taste indonesian food as the indonesian food supposed to be, you have to come to this place. its not a restaurant but more take away restaurant though there are 2 tables where you can sit and enjoy your meal. the sate is very good so the other things too."
toko madjoe is take out only. very popular with the locals it gets very busy around 4-6pm. with a very large selection of indonesian dishes to choose from.  the taste and quality is very authentic!!!
"although this shop has 1-2 small tables to enjoy some of their food on the spot, this essentially is a take-out shop for ready-made indonesian food and ingredients for home-cooki "
"stayed at the amsterdam forest and got to compare the 3 restaurants in the area and this seemed to be the most reasonably priced of the 3 (one was serving food worth 75 euro. no wonder it was empty!). well, theres a pizza restaurant nearby but pizza for lunch or dinner sounds of "
it was a wonderful experience. delicious food and great service. i would highly recommend this restaurant.
"absolutely amazing food. i had the tbone, cooked to my specification and was perfect. we had a wee tray of sauces that were a beautiful accompaniment to our meal. the customer experience was warm, welcoming and super attentive. reasonably priced and worth every penny. anyone staying in the amstelveen area should make a visit. thank you for the wonderful meal."
super food and ambient! great taste of all natural! handmade meal is handmade meal. no plasticsss we eat everyday. and the fire smells so fantastic! bravooooo bravooo bravooo!
visited here a number of times during a week long stay in amstelveen. the staff were very friendly and service was excellent. the weather was great so we could sit outside. drinks or a meal the service always came with a smile and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. the were a couple of veggie/vegan options and the home made hummus was amazin 
"been coming here since 2005 love the place , kebabs are divine , all the food is so tasty and reasonably priced ."
"place is clean. just in front of my hotel. great service, tasty food, accurate prices.  what else for a quick dinner!!! very recommendable!!! tbone stock was delicious üòã"
"this is an informal, no-frills place. if you‚Äôre after simple, fresh but high quality food after a busy day, and you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood, the food here is excellent. i was staying in the delightful forest hotel just across the road, and came here for a falafel after a long day. the falafel was perfect with wonderful fresh pittas and lovely tahini and humus dips. i ordered orange juice which came freshly squeezed. i liked it so much i went back the next night and had shoarma which was shredded lamb. a huge portion, again with lots of wonderful fresh dips to choose from. there is a menu in english and the service was friendly and efficient. the restaurant area is quite basic - i wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a big night out - but for a good quality quick informal meal it‚Äôs perfect. they also have some outside seating for a warm evening. "
"i was staying across the road at the amsterdam forest hotel and didnt want to go too far to eat. this place was.l just what i needed. the waiter was really helpful with my questions on the old and they tailored the spice up to my liking. food was very tasty and enjoyable. it was simple, but not fussy and just what id hoped for. i wouldnt travel far especially to eat here, but if youre close by its a good option."
we ate here once while staying in amstelveen. i had the chicken livers which were fantastic. the food portions are generous and come with lots of lovely little sauces to dip everything  
this little bar & grill wont disappoint but be careful not to overdo the garlic mayo...the wife wont come near me now lol
"the rooz was walking distance from our aribnb and a good choice. first of all, its an unassuming fa√ßade, right off the bike path on a busy street. however, what it lacks in wow factor is made up by the pleasant, very helpful staff and interesting me "
"dont be deceived by the basic interior and limited wine menu. generous portions, excellent friendly service and superb food makes this place a winner! the avocado salad is to die for! the chicken is tender and marinated to perfection. not sure what the theme is here but there are israeli street plaques on the walls and the menu is between lebanese and greek. the restaurant is only across the road from the delightful amsterdam forest hotel so if you are a weary traveler its an ideal spot. the only downside is that since this is outside the main city the menu is not available in english so assistance was needed by the staff to decipher the menu! "
"the rooz grill bar offers oriental / israeli style food (falafel, pita etc.). the food we ordered didnt take long to be served and was good quality. it was all fresh, and especially the dips and sauces really seemed freshly and home made. only the waitress could have been a little more attentive. we wanted to have another drink, but she always went about, not paying much attention to us, once we had our food."
"such a nice cafe with lovely ambience and good quality coffee. loved the cafe their coffee, carrot cake and the cheese sandwich is just perfect. wouldn‚Äôt mind visiting again."
"the bookstore we had visited already on multiple occasions. this cafe inside it looks appealing, but somehow we always walked past it. this time i took some time to get a tea and apple juice with my daughter. friendly staff, nice seating and it was good to see some scrablle going on at the large table. a nice place. if you want to nuy or browse some books, be sure to have a tea here as well."
"an excellent place to enjoy great coffee, wonderfully crunchy toasties, and other delectables. very nice serving staff! and surrounded by books books books!"
"if in need of a cup of tea, especially if alone, this is the right place! it is relaxing to sip while watching the main square or reading a book that can be borrowed in the cafe."
"very much in demand, the venstra caf√© continue to be many peoples option to go with friends or family after shopping in the area, or shopping in the bookshop to which the caf√© is attach "
this is a nice place to go for a coffee or tea with friends and take opportunity to buy books or gif 
so vegan friendly that they can make almost any dish veg 
"the restaurant is just a 5 minute walk from the tram station. amazing thai food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere and great value for money!"
"i eat here 3 times a week and every time its delicious, they have something for everyone and very friendly staffüî•"
"lovely place, wonderful ambiance, friendly and welcoming staff. the dishes are nicely decorated and  delightful. ."
"oded very good host and thai food up to mark! every now and then, we have dinner and it really reminds us of the days we had to travel via bangkok for duty! tip : if you like it, take the hot beef thai version,! ask oded how many hot peppers you want, in your dish!! i take 3 for kicks, tea, water!sart with one dutch genever.!!! then the irish coffee in the end and your back in bangkok almost! pffff, next time i will ask him to put up thr central heating to 30 degrees....!!!! "
nice restaurant close to our hotel. the three spice fish was super tasty and the service was great. noodles were not the best but the rice was great
"my mother and i came here as our first dinner in amsterdam and we were beyond amazed! food was amazing and very large portions, well priced and the staff were so kind."
"we had a nice family dinner of four and they offer both self-order food and set-menu food. we did not get the set-menu food since ordering separately was cheaper considering the enormous quantity of food they offer per dish. overall, we thought it was a good restaurant with a good (food-quantity) value for money. however, we had to wait 20 min to get a table so would definitely recommend to reserve a table before going there."
we had friends visit at amstelveen and we went to thai from sky.  the pad thai was the best i ever ate.  massaman dish grabbed by all parties and we immediately ordered another one - don‚Äôt miss it!
"weve dinner at this restaurant late night, and were very impressed about how gently were the people. were actually alone in the restaurant - no other costumers - but theyve served us so fast and spent time talking about thai culture. the food was generously served and tasteful - this was my 1st experience in thai food and ive approved. "
"whenever we are out of options for unplanned dinner, this is the place. always available, good food very consistent and price is also decent. if you are looking for an easy asian option in amstelveen, this is the place!"
"again ,we never have been disappointed,even after our 5 th visit???while on detachment abroad,we had to fly via bangk "
visited thai from sky in may 2017 while on holiday. the restaurant is located inside of a somewhat dated shopping mall. the food was very nice and tasty. the waiter was nice and attentive. quick service. would go back if i ever visit amstelven again.
get the taste of thai food at this cozy restaurant. staff/owner very friendly and always smiling. food is good and service is quite quick!
this place serves authentic tasty thai food and for a thai girl like me they made it extra spicy! they have just renovated and the restaurant looks amazing!
"if you are looking for good thai food, this is it. thai from sky is situated inside the shopping area near the zonnestein metro station next to dirk van den broek super market. the decor and the seating is decent, not the swankiest place but the staff is quite friendly. this restaurant also offers take away and delivery however delivery is only after 5 pm and take away is after 2 pm, thats the time when it open "
it is many years that i am addicted to this place. i come here regularly for take-away meals or to sit in the restaurant. they recently renovated the place and maintained their nice cuisine.
"i dont know what everyone else is talking about, but this place is great. came here and experienced amazing service and excellent food. the atmosphere is nice, and while the prices are a bit higher than other thai joints, its worth it, because portions are a good size, and the food is of a different quality than the really cheap thai places. for example, the chicken here wasnt squishy, leathery chicken. it was great meat that was tender and delicious. my tom kha kai soup and stir fried spicy chicken with basil was yummy (and not too spicy... just right "
"its a real thai cooking in amstelveen, even comparable with the kind of thai restaurant in amsterdam city center (e.g bird) definitely try the papaya salad to accompany your thai red chicken curry, real good."
"we have been eating here some times before ans always the food is very good, both quality and quantity, with a very good plate of starters. people working there are nice, helpful and very knowledgeable. cant wait to go back!"
"after more than a week in amsterdam, my friend missed already thai food so we brought her to this restaurant. she ordered some vegetarian menu for us in her languange (thais) and we really had a good diner. the price is a little bit higher than other thai restaurants but you will have a delicious thai food."
"while visiting my family, we went to their favourite thai  place, and it was superb!  i got the perfect thai cuisine experience, and the waitress was so kind... ask for the som tum, you wont regret it"
we were there with the family for a dinner. the service and advise on the menu is something really appreciated by someone like me who is not a thai food expert  
warm ambience in this simple local thai.  friendly and efficient service.  the fish cakes were up to standard.  we asked for pad thai without onions - fine!
went with a group of 9 and had a very nice time. food was great and service was excellent. ordered several appetizers and main dishes and shared around the table family style. cost was very reasonable; about 16 euro per person and that included some beers and a bottle of wine. we will definitely be going back.
"we tried the food from this restaurant last month while we were in the neighborhood. the restaurant is located near major supermakets surrounded by other good eateries but is the only place serving thai food. the food was very well prepared and tasty. we had a soup and two curries on with green gravy and the other with red gravy. the dishes were very well spiced and seasoned and the quantity was very good as well. we also ordered food for takeaway on another occasion and were not dissapointed with the taste at all. the prices are on the higher side for a restaurant of its size and grade, but looking at the quantity and quality, the price is just about justified. hopefully the quality and price would remain stable in future as well."
the location is so so the food is good the prices are slightly high for a regular category restaurant.
well in time we made reservations for a birthday party. the manager talked us through what he could offer. we were offered a room and terrace for the period from 15.00 hrs. to 20.00 hrs. on a sund 
"we were there for dinner. it was nice and cozy restaurant. we had duo van wild and spare ribs. both dishes were amazing, well decorated and delicious. dessert was great all. staffs were lovely."
"beachclub nu offers a restaurant but also a very nice terrace where you can enjoy the view of the beach, the lake and in the distance you get a glance of the nice former fisher town elbu "
"as it was a bit windy and chill, we were sitting inside. however, we can still enjoy our snack time here, with beach scene and city far ahead."
had their homemade bitterballen and the fruitcake. nice restaurant ambient with terrace. they got as well their own organic vegetables farm. plenty of parking space.
we ate here many times. the restaurant is nice and intimate.  the food and service is perfect.  i recommend it to everyone.
"again a great evening, company, great wine, ask for the wine list! the food is excellent for this price, not even mentioning the atmosphere and the service, thanks  a lot!"
the restaurant is located near the center of bedum. the restaurant is not to big and has a nice atmosphere and friendly staff. we enjoyed a very good three course dinner on a sunday evening. the food is above average but the prices are very reasonable. if you want to visit this restaurant it might be wise to make a reservation.
first visit here was very well received. went with a family of 4. waiters very good. atmosphere nice if a little over the top on the french inauthenticity. food was excellent.
"this is the restaurant of my hometown, im a regular customer. the menu is above average but the price level is very reasonable. the restaurant gives a cozy, slight luxury impression. the staff is very friendly and hit the perfect stance. also families with children will have a nice evening over here. try the desser "
i had dinner here with a friend. the menu consisted mostly out of numerous pastas and pizzas. but the good stuff is found in the meat dishes. we started our dinner with a big plate of antipasti for two. but in reality this was easily enough to feed three peopl 
we were recommended this restaurant by the owner of the b&b we stayed at nearby and it was exactly as he described it. a vast range of pizzas (i have never seen a menu with so many different kinds of pizza!). clearly very fresh ingredients and the staff were all very friendly. definitely recommended.
"we had something to celebrate and went with 4 people for a dinner. when we made the reservation we were advised to change our arrival time a little since also a large group came at the same time. always nice if they think ahead! when we arrived we were welcomed very friendly and we could choose where to sit. they didnt mind our baby and were very friendly to the baby. good and timely service, very good real italian food, friendly people and a real good price. like in italy they dont mind if you order a pizza which is not on the menu. even gluten-free for my wife was no problem."
best pizzas ive had in my life so far. has a section where kids can play until the food is served.
"always a friendly welcome. cozy little bistro with a surprisingly tasty menu from local suppliers made in the small kitchen/battleground just inside the door. well worth a visit for a coffee, tea salad or lunch."
"the sandwiches and salades that are served here are of a very high quality at a reasonable price. they look good and taste even better. the only downside is that you cant have a normal conversation inside, since there are too many tables in a small room. if the weather is good enough, make a reservation for a table outside. no view, but a better atmosphere! note that this is not a restaurant for a fast lunch!! time beween ordering and serving can easily run up to more then half an hour."
it sounds italian - but nothing like that! it is tastefull spiced antillian caribic food & sandwiches in a housechamber setting. at the entrace you can take a look in the kitchen and have a talk with the cook.
"on vacation in nijmegen, my friends invited me to discover a small lunch place in beneden-leeuwen. it‚Äôs on the road from nijmegen to ‚Äòs hertogenbosch, about a 20 minute drive from nijmegen. this small village in gelderland is a typical dutch village with all the charm of it. on that road stands a small plaza, composed of a coffee roaster, a decoration shop and an excellent lunch room, called marcus antonius, named after the owner who is also the cook and sometimes the waiter: marc. only a few tables stands in a nice and well decorated room. those tables are not design tables, but strong wooden structures. natural wood, just as the food: natural and quality food. we went for high tea. it is not the high tea we know, but composed of different dishes and one sweet dish. i got the caribbean tomato soup: creamy with plenty of herbs. very tasty. it was so good, that i ordered a second portion. we also got a degustation of goat with grilled egg-plant topped with a small piece of goat cheese, and finally grilled salmon with vegetables. it was really good. the lunch menu is also composed of the more traditional dishes such as salads (carpaccio salad, grilled thai chicken salad, guapo salad), toasted bread (cream cheese, honey and lemon thyme or more traditional : ham and cheese) and lots of sandwiches with lots of cold cuts, cheeses, poultry, salads and much mor "
"we watch a hard working draw bridge that leads tourists sailing their boats towards the tjeukermeer while we are having our beers, our perfectly chilled glass of wine and enjoying the traditional dutch bitter balls. wonderful place with good service."
visited while staying with friends in the are 
went here with the family.  always a good place to go for dinner. they now have a tablet system like a lot of sushi places have to place some orders. very nice buffet and highly recommend you try it out!
you pay the one price which includes non-alcoholic drinks and access to the buffet for 2.5 h 
"a great combination of asian and international food, you can choose your ingredients and create your own wok. i particularly liked the indonesian specialities. non alcoholic beverages included."
"we went here for the 2nd easter day.  wasnt too busy, but lots of food to choose from!  everything was great!!!! if you do go, try to get a table in the back room.  i call it the atrium.  its all glass."
"i have been here many times already and can highly recommend this place for dinner. it has a really large variety of dishes to choose from. ranging from sushi to pizza to steaks to grilled fish to chinese to wok dishes, all is there and in perfect quality. the drinks are also included into the all-you-can-eat price and are not even limited to the standard basic drinks, but also fresh orange juice (delicious!), coffee, tea and less common drinks. for alcohol containing drinks you will have to pay one euro extra per gla "
"went here on the way home from de orchidee√´n hoeve. the place is very large and can hold a lot of people. food area is in the center with seating on two sides. lighting was very nice, not too bright and not too dark. the food was amazing. it was a buffet, so they had several options for the picky eater. steaks, seafood, wok, sushi, pizza, pasta, all sorts of veggies & potatoes. with the entrance fee (for up to 2 1/2 hours), you get all you can eat including drinks minus anything alcoholic. desserts were very nice as well. ice cream (vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, banana & lemon sherbet) soft ice cream, home made creme brule & waffles, lots of other deserts also. staff was very nice and polite. there were lots of employees walking around to pick up empty plates & glasses when you were done with them so you can come back with a fresh pla "
i am a truck driver and as truckstops go this is very good food was very good for the money i had the ribs and a meatball over a 2day stop ov 
"we ate three times in the restaurant whilst staying at the hotel during the weekend. a private buffet party provided everyone with a good combination of freshly cooked hot food with a variety of cold dishes. every last crumb of food was devoured - it was that delicious. breakfast was typical euro fare but very tasty and plates frequently replenished with cold meats, cheeses & breads. a simple lunch before departure was a little slow in arriving but no wonder with so many show visitors ordering such large, hearty meals. well worth calling in here if passing by on the motorway. if you are a long distance lorry driver these people will really look after you. highly recommended for very tasty food at extremely reasonable prices."
"i have been here several times, all the visits are great! lots of food, not too expensive and great servi "
awesome place to enjoy a nice cold beer and snacks with a bunch of good friends. perfect place to relax and have a nice chat.
"just had superb evening sampling beers provided by the knowledgeable folks at pelles with my team mates from the netherlands, germany and  "
"we are a vegetarian and a meat eater and we both had a delicious dinner. the food was well seasoned and the wine was delicious. the waitress was super nice. you can sit outside and they have a lovely courtyard, covered when it rains you are semi outside. inside the restaurant it is a kind of brown cafe. very nice."
after our day at the beach we walked back to this little plaza with a few restaurants and chose duinlust cus of its homely and cosy appearance in which the restaurant differs itself from the others.. it was quite hot and busy but the staff remained calm and friendly. the food was really amazing and fast. weve had a really good experience and we will be back soon!!
"eetcafe is the best place in dishoek for relax and food. in the center of dishoek just in font of the dune to go to the beach. very good food very friendly service , also nice rooms for rent. fantastic breakfast. my favourite place in this erea."
"friends of ours have visited this place before. they told us it was good and we put it to the test. indeed, service, friendliness and excellent food. that about sums it up. if this place hadnt been closed during the week, we would have stayed there. im not easy to please, but they did it here. well be back!"
"expected more for this price. you can order only 2 dishes per round and they are really small.  wive is very expensive for such place. menu is very big, but this doesn‚Äôt cost this money."
"what a great night. we were seated inside but asked to sit outside and this was not a problem. its a great location, very nice square. didnt like all the dishes, but some were really good (peppersteak!!). there something for everyone. and a big thanks to iris for the great service!!"
"are you looking for a restaurant to eat with you family? this a great place for families with excellent service! everyone can order his or hers favorite starters, main and deserts from the menu while catching-up in a great atmosphere. the food is excellent and offers also many gluten-free and vegetarian options. "
"we went here for a business dinner, the concept is nice, you order 2 dishes (like small tapas) at a time until you dont want more or the kitchen closes.  everything i tried was delicious and they had a lot to choose from!"
in this area there are several eaters however the place is special and it made enhancing my experience. the location of the restaurant is prime and the menu has variety and the staff provides exceptional service by hea

me and my girlfriend were traveling in the netherlands and saw the good reviews of this restaurant. so we decided to come to try it for ourselves last sund 
absolute a must if you visit doetinchem. luc schatorje and his team are running this restaurant with an overwhelming enthusia 
"for a friday night making a reservation is practical if you are planning to go there for dinner. it is a nice place for just a drink and a bite, as well as for a full dinner. the food is mexican, tapas and fusion and had plenty of vegetarian options too. the quality is quite good and effort has been put in to make it look nice. informal and cosy, attracting a variety of people. probably one of the most lively places in doetinchem, also on weekdays. i definitely recommend this place.

"we had dinner here with our customer on a week night. we first received a basket with nacho‚Äôs with salsa. the nacho‚Äôs are really tasty, but they should make the portions salsa bigge "
i like the restaurant. it has several different styles of decoration 
"this restaurant is one of my favorite places. a mexican restaurant in the center of doetinchem with a large grill selection. personally i am fond of their creekstone farm meat, very tender and juicy till the end. i could recommend fajitas to the mexican lovers as this is great value for money. on weekends they open till 2am, where they change the place to a dance setting. good music and great cocktails. the most important element that this restaurant posses is atmosphere. it gives you a vibe when you walk in and see a huge bar engraved in wood. amazing!"
"this place is buzzing. popular with all ages with great food, excellent service and a lively atmosphere, its a reason to visit doetinchem!"

"surpising quality of food, friendly staff, on a saturday night it was probably the busiest place in the centre of doetinchem. we enjoyed very good tapas!"
"friendly staff, great tex-mex, gives you a hint of from dusk till dawn with the decorations - in a cool way :-) eat, drink, smile, enjoy!"
"we had a very good meal , as a starter shrimps in garlic in a pan , and as a main course spare-ribs with potatoes and colesl "
"what a great place! it is really big and when we visited on a tuesday it was far from full but they manage to maintain a lively, happy atmosphere. this is partly due to the quirky decor, partly the background music (not too intrusive and very varied) and partly by a log fire nearby.the lighting is on the dark side (but that may be my age!). the food was delicious and plentiful - the sizzling platters for the fajitas are flamed at the table - a nice bit of drama. service was good and they gave us english menus as well as speaking english. the men enjoyed the range of beers. will definitely recommend."
tapas style mexican food. nice margheritas but with low alcohol. i dranbk like 8 and nothing much happend :)

a nice restaurant with friendly service a super menu and a very cosy feeling about  
a wonderful atmosphere and very good food is what this restaurant offers. the prices are more than reasonable and broad choices. even western style food can be ordered or eaten from their buffet. usually they have some specials and package menus. lets all get amazed by the chinese cooks preparing your meal and dine in a stunning looking restaurant. highly recommended!!

the high ceiling and wood paneling are classier than you would expect if you see the outside of the building. staff is attentive and friendly. the food is hit and miss. desserts are a bit standard and have a bit a from a box character. fish and burgers were good. soup was a bit salty but tasty.
"its a dutch cafe, serving dutch food. and while that isnt necessarily a bad thing (we all have our tastes), it is the friendliness of the staff and the comfort the place offer that makes it ideal for lunc "
typical dutch food is served. a good range of lunch dishes and a more extensive dinner menu with interesting seasonal proposals. good value for money.
"stopped for lunch on our way to a football match. great choice, everybody happy with their choices and would come back again next time in doetinchem"
we had a delightful time with friends at this italian styled restaurant. i ordered the lasagna with salmon and it was excellent. all the pizzas that passed me by to other tables and my friend looked very good but my stomach was just too small to eat more. i also had the sou 
italian restaurant stretto (eten & drinken) is situated close to the market square in the centre of doetinchem. when we visited them we were lucky with the weather and could sit at a table on the terrace. where you can observe all the passers-by and have a great meal at the same time 
"great pizzas and atmosphere, polite crew and helpfull,in the heart of the city and also nice terrace"

"we had our christmas dinner at entree1863 with 22 business partners. the restaurant is situated in a very stylish and cosy villa. the food was absolutely delicious and the staff is very professional and friendly. nice short but passionate desciptions of every course. the 5 courses were very tastfull, with great wines to accompany the food, in a very relaxed, not too formal setting. we will return here soon, we can recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes great food and true hospitality!"
very nice and friendly staff. the menu has a fair quantity of choices and a something for everyone. i especially enjoyed the curry and ginger soup and the apple bites on the pork belly. the banana with chocolate was not the best dessert ever..
i was invited to join celebration of my friend‚Äôs 25th anniversary and i must say i had wonderful evening.  the chef yarun makes food by heart. the most experienced lady i don‚Äôt remember the name how‚Äôs she has great knowledge of suggesting beverages.
a nice place in this city. with a cuisine which is unlikely for this area. nice person 
"the food was wonderful, friendly service and great atmosphere! personnel was very helpful with wheelchair. all dishes were great."
"i have been there once. food in this restaurant is very good, staff are very friendly. there isint much tables inside. the menu is in greek which when you pick your dishesh you dont reqlly know what you will get but you can ask staff members for help and they will explain it to you."

the host is a wonderful hospital man. he creates an atmosphere of real good food in a modern nice environment. the glass terrace is a great place to eat and enjoy. you always get enough and never leave with a half full belly.
this is a small family run restaurant that serve traditional greek food as they have ties to greece. they have very friendly staff and serve nips of liqueur as soon as you sit down. the shared platters were delicious and filled us easily without any space for dessert. the lamb is also delicious since it comes from new zealand! cant recommend enough for a small village!
i really love it. i have been there couple of times and every time lived the food and service. my favourite now. i will surely go more often.  they have good vegetarian choices as well.
"delicious food, great hospitality and fair prices. we had a lovely evening. the owners took good care of their guests. recommended."
"we came to visit the museum which is located in haastrecht, and while passing by de ijsselborgh have decided to have dinner in this restaura "
this is a great place for a meal if you are in haastrecht. it has indoor and outdoor patio seating. they serve their meals in courses and have a nice variety of options on their menu. they also provide their menu in english as well. our server was great and she spoke english very well. haastrecht is already a pretty neat dutch village and the proeflokaal bregje only adds to that charm. enjoy!
"our host recommended this restaurant for a family dinner, and we were not disappointed. we liked everything about it - the food, the service, the atmosphere and the moderate prices. we highly recommend it ourselves!"
good place for a nice evening out without an empty pocket afterwards. we have been here a number of times and the quality was always the same.
"we visited a family member in haastrecht and four of us came here on a monday night. the set meal is cheaper on monday to wednesday so is even better value for 3 courses. i had shrimp salad to start, the beef for main and cheese board or desert, all excellent. i tasted the chicken main dish, again very good. all four of us enjoyed our choices and loved the atmosphere, the service was friendly and efficient and the wine reasonably priced. definitely worth a visit."
"good food compared to their price. i had a goat cheese salad, a caprese tart and as dessert the chocolate cake with ice cream. loved all of this! the only thing that was a bit disappointing was the chocolate cake. its supposed to be a chocolate fondant, but the middle wasnt really melted. dont get me wrong it was still a great dessert and definitely worth the tr "
"in a small village, it was a very surprising lunch. for 12,5 euros ( starter, main course and dessert) the best quality and a very nice and smily service. perfect dinner."
"the hotel isnt the most modern one but the atmosphere is good and the rooms are nice, a bit countru side style. the rooms are not directly in the building with the reception and an elevator isnt available. the restaurant offers a wide choise of dishes and the breakfast was good. in room wifi is free of charge, fast enough and stable. the room was very clean as well as the bath room. price versus quality this hotel is a very good choise."
the service person is very attentive. mustard soup is good. nice light flavor. tomato soup was nice. ribs are good but not delicious.
we stopped here for lunch on thursda 
very cosy place with atmosphere. busy place but we could easily run a conversation. good food and absolutely value for money. kind staff. will come back.

good service from koen and several food to chose. gives good atmosphere and enjoys your stay. reason to go more times
"if you are looking for a nice lunch place in the struytse hoeck shopping center, la place is the place to be (they do not have much more choice, unless you like dutch snack bars!) prices are reasonable and food is cooked made to order. the burgers are especially tasty! "
had a lovely dinner with the family. started with some bread and a nice bottle of white wonen. got a good advice to wat because i could niet choose from the menu.
"no guide michelin but honest good food. the meat was excellent as was the fish. next time were here, well go back."
"busy place and it was good we had reserved. nice people, good food and enjoyed our time there. i had a nice stake, my friend a nice piece of fish. for starters muscles and scrimps in a nice sauce. we took the wine arrangement, even got limonicello with my cheese cake as dessert. all in all, a nice experience."
"it was our second visit to de buren and we had a perfect diner! we come mainly for the steaks, my partner always orders the aged rib eye, and i am a filet fan! this time i had the tournedos classique (beef filet wrapped in bacon, with caramelized onions and mushrooms, in a madeira jus.) omg it was so tasty, cooked to perfection.they have a huge beer menu but we went for the long island ice tea cocktail this time, and they were delicious and perfectly balanced. the service is always great, both by kirsten and anouschka, thanks again for an amazing nig "
"for guinness drinkers, youll be pleased to know, they sell it here "
"this cozy eetcaf√© located within the old fortress area of hellevoetsluis reminds me of our english pubs back home.friendly,helpfull staff, great atmosphere, good service and good food."
"cafe de buren is in the center of hellvoetsluis and one of the liveliest bars. you can normally find a table tucked away from the bar to enjoy good quality, reasonably priced home cooked food. please note the burger is the size of a dinner plate, so you have to be hungry!"
"very good food, beer and service. the spare ribs and steak were excellent. the staff were frienly and very helpful."
dinner with 7 people. as it should be good food and drink and a friendly service. on sunday evening delivery at home. again excellent.
"we just recently spent two wonderful weeks in the citta romana resort (2 adults + 2 kids). during that time we also enjoyed a handful of dinners at the duinhoek which were all very good. our last dinner though was simply fantastic: black angus bbq ribs which were not only the best ribs i have ever enjoyed, but also fairly priced at ‚Ç¨50 for two persons. we were honored to talk to the chef and he explained everything around how long it took to prepare them (1,5-2 days). these ribs really redefined the meaning of the words tender and juicy. if we ever make it back to citta romana, these ribs will be part of the experience again :-)"
"we had the month menu at duinhoek, food was excellent. staff was friendly and professional. this was our second visit, and we will go back for more."
"nice friendly little place  small menu but well cooked &  presented food mix of styles, pizzas, steaks etc recommended eatery"
this offers comprehensive dining for the residents of citta romana and visitors alike. it is spacious and has a large outdoor terrace overlooking an ornamental pond.  service varies depending whos on duty and weather the neighbouring events hall is in use or not.
amazing food in a lovely environment with super staff. incredible ribs but everything else is great too. we have visited quite a few times this year (plus back in 2018) and i would rate it very highly every time. well done
"we were lucky enough to come across this lovely restaurant the other day. the owner and waitress were so helpful and so friendly it was an absolute pleasure. thats before i mention how delicious the food was. my husband had their signature dish which looked amazing and he absolutely loved. im coeliac and although the menu is not marked up for gluten free - dont be afraid to ask. the owner was so helpful and i appreciate so much her advice and care in preparing my meal...... the steak, sauce, specially prepared potato and vegetables were all delicious. we thanked them for a lovely evening."
"we had a very nice dinner and were pleased by the attent service en the quality and diversity of the food. we took the breadbasket before starter, interesting two types of dough baked together. starter goat cheese in filo dough and my friend a carpaccio. main course baked muscles for me, salmon with creamy orange saus, both very good. little ice cream as desert."
"we were welcomed in dutch but the staff immediately translated once they learnt we are english. the recommended dishes were superb. ribs were well up to standard, my wife had fresh venison - cooked perfectly. the wine was of a good standard but the only draught beer was heineken. bottled ales were available too thou "
hi great place every time we come to hellevoetsluis its a must. never fails.  just try it. the choice of menu is great and not to expensive.
very friendly staff and love the four course menu with asparagus. the ambiance is nice and cozy. the desert was delicious.
came across this restaurant by accident when strolling around the shopping centr 
"we happened to come across this place whilst at the shopping centre and decided to try it for lunch. the portions that other people were having were absolutely huge so we decided to go for the ‚Ç¨11 lunch menu. we both got indonesian pork with fried noodles and it was delicious and absolutely huge! we couldnt finish it all but we really enjoyed what we had. the service was very attentive and we thought it was incredibly good value for money. my only small criticism is that it was quite cold inside and even though the food was served on hot plates, my food went cold very quickly. "
"in shoppingcenter, above parking garage this indonesian-chinese restaurant. weve had several meals here and always good. typical chinese dutch but also different plates. let them surprise you. atmosphere is light, clean. you can also order take away. price -quality perfect"
"located in the main shopping center of this town with a nice atmosphere inside and very friendly service. the indonesian food was good, although not spectacular. they have a buffet too. recommended."
"loads of food at low cost. ultimate hangoverfood. would go back there tomorrow, to cure my hangover. best flied lice evel."
this must be the best restaurant in lemmer. what a great visit this was! nice staff and wonderful food. i will warmly recommend everyone who visit lemmer to also visit de baai van lemmer.
without a doubt the best restaurant in town and in the larger neighborhood. we were welcome with 3 ! amuses (in fact the third amuses was a combination of two: a spicy bitterbal and a small aspergesou 
"really enjoyed our experience here. a warm welcome to start. no english menu but waitress very happy to translate for us. the chef was leaving at 8pm so we could not order starters, only main dishes. however we were treated to little canap√©s until our main arrived. very decoratively presented meals and very tasty. definitely worth a visit"
i enjoyed an evening here with local frien 
"very friendly restaurant with excellent food.  we particularly enjoyed the asparagus soup, iberian wildboar and the tarbot fish."
"we had a family 70th birthday party here and it was great atmosphere. lovely food, great service. nice area for children to play. very family friendly restaurant."
"perfect place to enjoy the canal action,the small town activity, the locals and the tourists.perfect for  a group and for a family with children.good quality, fast service with a smile."
"we were with a group of 5 and had a good experience. we all loved our food, which was the main deal. a little disappointed in the waiting staff, they seemed a little inexperienced. therefore, no 5 stars, but the food wouldve be worth it!"
"good restaurant in the heart of lemmer. warm atmosphere, good food, friendly staff. must visit for pizza lovers!"
really friendly staff and the service was quick. went back the next day and he remembered us and our drinks. excellent!
"we were sitting outside the british pub, but i assumed we had dinner at ald lemm "
"we ate at the pub (outdoors). food is just how you would love it, we chose the liver, which is hard to get right most of the time. these guys just got it right, lovely taste, lovely additions, very neatly placed on your plate with anything you could dream of, and at a very affordable price. ok, most people would go for fish when at a water site, but this simply was not on our menu that very night. expecting not too bad quality, we were pleasantly surprised with the menu, and the servants. dont forget, they really have a great beer choice too !!!"
"do you want a night out in a nice, relaxing ambience, attentative service, mouth wathering, autentic food ? than this is the place ! go on a food journey with every dish a new explosion of flavors. the rijst tafel (many options) will give you a complete set of everything. portions are well sized so you will not leave hungry. we have lived 9 years in indonesia and have visited indonesisn restaurants in holland, this one trumps them all. everything is made fresh, so do not be in a rush, enjoy the time to stand still and talk....."
a great combination of an atmospheric old building offering great ambience with a modern high quality menu. have been here three times each two years apart and quality has been excellent each time. well worth picking as your choice in montfoo 
"we eat here  three times, every time the food was very good. the staff is very friendly. highly recommend."
"i think this is a nice restaurant, they serve good food and the staff is very friendly. i recommend it."
enjoyed a lovely christmas day dinner here. we had reserved a place and we were presented with a wonderful multi-coursed feast. we made our own selections within a preset listing for appetizers and main courses. wonderful! dessert was an assortment for each table with a variety of small samples that we thoroughly enjoyed. staff was very friendly and efficient in spite of the large group. the only downside was the above average noise level. overall a very pleasant experience. we will be returning!
one of the few restaurants which are open on a monday at lunch time.  we had an excellent lunch. average priced.  good service. especially with foreign customers there is an english menu. so you dont need to translate from dutch.
"het oude stadhuis is the place to be if you want to eat in a beautiful old dutch building. the place is small, the atmosphere is vibrant, the food is ok, a bit overpriced. but who cares in such beautiful surroundings."
"just arrived in holland after our ferry journey from harwich,england. staying on a local farm b&b. went to a local restaurant before our visit to the stadhuis. were told that they were closing due to no customers and the weathe "
i have had lunch here several times in the past and have never been disappointed. i cannot comment on their service at other times but at lunchtime the service has always been very friendly and helpful; the menu is fairly limited but i have never been disappointed with either the quality or the presentation of what is provided. at the price it would be hard to beat.
"attended the first sunday crooning event with laura fygi.show was great. food was excellent, and the staff were very attentive. all in all a fabulous afternoon, worth travelling from scotland to attend."
we had some lovely ice cream to go after a festive weekend. the flavors are really good. occasionally a flavor tastes a bit artificial. always a good place to buy some tasty treats.
"the ice cream is very tasty. they often have new and surprising flavors.  the location is nice, on the canal. there are some benches on the side of the street."
"daans droomijs is a icecream parlor near the hollandse ijssel in the center of montfoort. they serve homemade, original flavors."
working with fresh milk from local dairy farm the owner makes the most wonderful icecream. besides the classic flavors h√® also experiments with new creations. it is located in the lovely historic ceenter of montfoort on the river. in the summer you can sit outside and watch the boats come by.
"maybe not the most fancy restaurant as location, but the food is really nice. variated small luxurious dishes, not the standard meals, for everyone is there something nice. for the kids there is a nice playroom."
"excellent service, friendly staff, and a really lovely six course dinner at a very reasonable price.  highly recommend to those who like something different.  vegan and vegetarian friendly also!"
"size of the restaurant is middle. it is kind of classy but not too expensive. i really like the tapas here, not the standard meals."
"tried to update the listing to its new name pannenkoe ridderkerk, but the app did not process we "
"our first meal on this trip to holland. we enjoyed traditional dutch pancakes (just like the ones my dutch father makes) with untradtional toppings. my husband tried the french version (thinly sliced ham & brie), while i tried the italian (ham, mozzarella, tomato and basil). we shared a dish of ice cream for dessert, along with a good, strong cup of coffee to help combat the jet lag. our server was engaging and did her best to accommodate us in english. despite the busy dinner hour, service was prompt and efficient."
my sister and her friends are regular visitors to this restaurant and it came highly recommende 
last saturday had dinner here with my sister 
"nice location, very friendly waiters, good interior. burgers look very nice but meat is a beat tough, while very juicy. soup was great"
"the service is ok and the food here is good, a decent plate filled with fresh food, presented beautifully! the sphere is ok too, easy to have a large company for drinks and bites."
"food is pretty good, lots to choose from, drinks are super nice, will definitely come back! service is also very nice."
the concept of ordering small dishes in rounds is well known in sushi. but it was a small surprise when we found out that it was also possible with small french themed dish 
had a lovely coffee break with excellent cappuccino and warm apple cake. friendly and helpful staff.  the atmosphere was very relaxed. beautiful view over the river.
"relaxed atmosphere, great to enjoy the beautiful day we where having... staff was very helpfull en friendly. food was very good.."
"mixed menu, meat and fish in french kitchen and everything is good. however if there is a local activity going on like a market a fair or village celleberation, or you are short on time or not being dressed accordingly do not go here. it is a nice restaurant with nice staff and great food but you have to be willing take your time to enjoy the food. best is to reserve upfront. the owner is very friendly and likes to get to know his customers so one should be prepared ending up chatting with him."
"the food is really super. very good prices, prefer this to the beukelaar, across the road, which was a scam.  this place is nice, great garden, food and service. very clear, fair pricing. it was super."
we had lunch there with 10 people. everything was served fast and we got the food at the same time. food was nice.
"escaping the busyness of a holiday resort we looked for a place to have a family dinner. staff was nice and kids were given drawing material immediately. choice is plenty. the place wasnt packed as it was still early (around 18:00). food serving time was good especially when visiting with kids. our choice was a starter and main course which was good, nothing fancy. pricing is average."
"there were not too many british tourists travelling through sellingen but the staff all spoke perfect english. the restaurant was quiet but to be fair the weather was quite cool and stormy for september. the decor is clean and comfortable and food very good we are here twice and had the steak and the chicken satay & also the snitzel all very good, would recomme "
"we had a great time at kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel in s-heerenberg. the caf√© is in a beautiful location, near the impressive kasteel huis bergh. the service was friendly and attentive, and the food was fresh and flavorful. we can recommend this caf√© to anyone looking for a unique and cozy experience in a historic setting."
good place for resting. rest is in beatiful. cheese sandwich is perfect. good ambiance for relaxing. thanks for all
"we went here for lunch with a gift certificate. the reception by the host was very welcoming. the weather was great so we sat on the terrace, in the shade of the nice trees with a view of the castle and the tower that houses one of the guest roo "
"good food and good service, very attentive. we were sitting outside in the sun with a great view at the castle"
the cafe next to the castle was very nice. the beer selection was great and the service friendly and good. the basic cheese sandwich was cheap and good and the tomato soup was amazing. only when i left did i notice a very small room next to the main dining area that is vey scenic. prices are really good despite being next to the castle. the food was generally lighter for lunch - it was lunch time when i was there.
"this caf√© / restaurant changed its name from grand caf√© heeren dubbel into kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel because it is located at the kasteel huis bergh (castle house bergh). the tickets for tours of the castle are even sold inside the restaurant. before or after your visit of the castle and gardens, you should have a drink outside or inside the kasteel caf√© heeren dubbel. the atmosphere is great. the staff is friendly and the food is good too. we will revisit this place!"
"what a beautiful setting, what lovely food and what wonderful service staff. we love this place and its wine selection. make sure to pay a visit to the castle while youre there!"
this is most probably the best restaurant in the town. very friendly service and the food is well prepared and with attention. we went back a few times and it‚Äôs recommended to go there.
amazing ambiance. this hours is very expensive. but meals is good. thanks for all stuff. the night lights look very nice.
"we had a good and affordable 2 course dinner at snouzen! staff was friendly and approachable.  the restaurant is centrally located, near the hotel de lantscroon."
"a nice restaurant in the middle of the city on a central place. you can also arrive there with car. the menu is only dutch and german but an english version would be fine. the personel is very friendly and quick. clean, modern and warm at the same time. mmmmm the food excellent. tasty and portions pleanty enough. a nice please to visit aga "
"situated in the heart of the picturesque city of s-heerenberg, this restaurant has a lovely and cozy terrace. the food we had for lunch was very good and not expensive at all. brilliant service!"
"we only had a quick lunch after our walk in the natural park, which is close by. the park is a must see, when you in this area and when you like to walk. the pancakes are very good. coffee and bakery is fine. the service is friendly and ok. the dining-room feels as a close connection to nature"
went for a stroll round the park then eat in the pancake house. excellent pancakes both savoury and desert. young friendly staff look after you. give this place a go if you are in the area.
"descending from the highway a7 at the petrol station van der valk offers you a reliable quality and good service, for an acceptable price.."
"to ensure we could make it until dinner time, we made a stop here to grab a bite between 2 and 3 in the afternoon. my partner picked a 12-oclock (twaalf uurtje), a selection of small bites, served nicely on a plate. apparently, very tasteful. i had a wrap, filled with chicken fillet, salad and a tasty dressing (heksenboter). also, very enjoyab "
"the van der valk chain of hotels also includes restaurants available to both hotelguests and the general public. open throughout the day they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner and a special sunday brunch (also during national holiday "

bij pauls never disappoints us. for the comfy atmosphere and the delicious food you cannot go wrong here. also the delicious food for the money is a great value. this restaurant continues to be our go to place for a reliably good meal and peaceful setti 
"we have eaten here many times: cappuccino and vlaai (prune) and apple tart; high tea; lunch (salad and sandwich and frites; and, dinner. we have never been disappointed. first of all, the cook(s) give attention to detail. the food is not only fresh and local and delicious but it is presented beautifully. the vlaai is the best i have ever eaten and i am not able to enjoy it anywhere else as there is no comparison to the way it is made at paul‚Äôs. the ice-cream is rich and creamy and there are many flavors. the cappuccino is a real italian cappuccino ‚Äì the best in zuid limburg. the high tea is so fun and tasty and a lovely setting to enjoy with friends and family. the lunch menu is tasty and dinner menu is also very good. this is our ‚Äúgo to‚Äù restaurant in the area as the food is fresh and so good. when the weather is nice the outdoor seating is comfortable. inside the restaurant, you have a visual delight. we highly recommend this restaurant and their wonderful flavorful menu and service. note: this is not just an ice-cream place, this is a wonderful full menu restaurant. as a vegetarian, i am always able to get a delicious meal. highly recommend the quiche. husband loves the margraten belgium blue steak."
"they make their own icecream as i was told, the flavors are amazing. the entourage is also very nice."
"we had a high tea here on a sunday afternoon. the location is very good, it had a very warm atmosphere. we got a lot of explanation of all the food served. they serve many special tea flavors which is very nice. the quality of the food was good and they serve generous portions. "
we came here for lunch after a walk to visit the windmi 
"a perfect place to have dinner. good quality food, prices are maybe a bit on the high side, but every euro worth. nice ambiance in the caf√©, nice personnel."
"great beer and fantastic service!! the bar server, leonie went above and beyond expectations. my husband and i had a couple beers at the lovely restaurant (and they even stayed open longer than they had too just for us). i accidentally left my jacket there and had to leave the next morning so couldnt pick it up. leonie sent it to me all the way to the us. i highly recommend this restaurant for fantastic service and great food and drinks."
"nice place, good food, options for vegetarians and gluten free plates. the service was really welcoming. we really suggest this restaurant!"
"at lunch, the person behind the bar and the waiter on the dining room floor wove through the crowd serving everyone in an efficient manner and were very hospitable. a few nice local beers on tap along with wine by the glass was a fine compliment to out traditional dutch sandwiches (cheese sandwich) with fresh ingredients and hearty breads. definitely a local feel vs. touristy."
while staying in zaanse schans we dined in this restaurant which was right opposite our apartment. the service was very attentive by a lovely young lady and the food was very substantial and tasty. the place is very old in and outside.it is very quaint and has been well maintained. will certainly come again if we are ever in amsterdam again. highly recommend.
have dinner here. you won‚Äôt regret it. we shared a platter selection of all the starters (fantastic) and then enjoyed our desserts!
"was completely charmed by this cosy little spot right in front of the windmill (sorry i cant remember the name). mika was a wonderful host and we absolutely loved the mustard soup with eel and homemade fresh bread! the spinach and cheese ravioli was simply a party-in-your-mouth experience! we also ordered the steak and fries, while the steak was good, we absolutely loved the fries! i don‚Äôt know what that used to make those fries, but it‚Äôs the best i‚Äôve ever tasted! my friend and i are were craving a mocha coffee and for some reason, there was none available from the shops we visited. mike was gracious enough to make us some and it was simply divine! we suggested she add this to her menu, especially since you can smell the rich fresh aroma of cacao that permeates throughout the area. the reason there‚Äôs a strong chocolate scent, is there is a chocolate plant in the heart of the little village. initially, we couldn‚Äôt make out the scent but it only took seconds for our olfactory nerves to identify it, & signal that information to our brain! outstanding service, food, price, & ambiance! "
"this place has just made our day, and trip in a certain way. it turned out to introduce us to the exquisite dutch cuisine as we were waiting for and were sort of unable to find in amsterd "
"after visiting zaanse schans we were looking for lunch. cross the bridge back toward the train station and find slager ann de schans. its a local restaurant with authentic food, without the tourist crowd. the croquettes and ham-and-cheese sandwich were excellent. the wine list is very reasonable. our waitress was friendly with excellent english. best meal weve had in holland."
while visiting the area we fund this little place. in the menu there is something for everybody and it was excellent.
visiting the netherlands and am staying nearby. dinner was incredible. very good pricing and variety on the menu. they also were great in accommodating me with a take out order for my daughter. will definitely eat here again before i leave to go home. the staff are wonderful. 
the service was fast and friendly. the food was delicious and tasty.  the sandwiches were fresh and delicious.  definitely recommend
"we went to slagers for lunch on the way and dinner on the way back to the train from zaanse schans. the hot ginger tea is lovely and we both enjoyed the vegetarian open sandwich on their dark brown bread. at dinner myles had the steak and chips, which was cooked to perfection, and i had the ravioli, lovely fresh pasta."
"i had one of the best seared tunas ever! just cooked to perfection! the atmosphere is really authentic, being an old historic slaughterhouse building. service was impeccable too. thank you!"
"this place is a must if you are planning to visit zaanse schans. their interior, ambience, services was amazing. we ordered their 3 course menus which was very tasty especially their duck and fish! i am a satisfied customer"
"was recommended by host at apartment 2 minutes away. we were talked through the set menu (28 euros, 3 courses) by the waitress as all in dutch. decided to choose options from that. it was all very nicely done and the starter ( smoked duck with pickles) in particular was very interesting and nothing like id ever had before. desert ( tarte tatin) was a bit small ( cut in half!?) and fish filet not large either but plenty of food as 3 courses. environment was rustic but felt authentically dutch."
"we stopped to take rest during local windmill visit. very nice place, tasty desserts, polite waitresses. my advise is to stop after the windmill visit.  ci siamo fermati dopo aver visitato i mulini. cameriere simpatiche e gentili, posto carino e dessert molto buoni. consigliato."
nice selection of open type sandwiches and toasties for lunch.  great location which allowed us to fuel up before walking around the windmills on an unuaslly hot day.  cash only too when i was there.
"you will love this place. the interior has been well decorated and kept in his original state. great choise menu, good food and wine at a very reasonable price."
"a very nice, elegant place with gourmet dishes. it also has a small terrace. the fowl was very good, deserts also."
had lunch during a visit to zaanse schans windmills. the burger was delicious. tip: free seating outside restaurant so pick a table and the waitress will pop by.
"we were referred to this brasserie by a local as we walked across the bridge from zaanse-schans. it was a perfect recommendation! the restaurant is charming and we truly enjoyed the food. we were there alone for a while and had a great conversation with the server. our sandwiches were very fresh and yummy. it started to fill up with people and we quickly realized that we made a great choice. if the weather is good, theres lots of outside dining. one of our best lunches during our trip to amsterdam!"
we were really impressed with this resturaunt. the atmosphere with two wonderfully tiled fireplaces and an excellently prepared delicious meal made this stop a lovely ending to a busy day. our sever was pleasant and proffesional. the resturaunt is under new ownership and you can tell they really care. there is plenty of street parking near by and the prices are much more reasonable here than on the historic site (windmills) near by. for 3 of us we paid 95 euros a la carte with drinks alcohol and coffees. 
"had a lunch at christmas, expected standard menu, but it was as special chrisrmas lunch. very supprising fine dinner."
"my boyfriend and i had lunch at de smuiger on our way to visiting zaanse schans. the food was really good. due to the nice weather we were able to eat outside on the terrace. the terrace is big, with nice views of a windmill. on walking distance of zaanse schans. and very good price/quality. friendly and helpfull staff."
"when a friend and i were taking a ferry to zaanse schans, a fellow-traveller told me she and her friend would be having lunch at de smuiger, which she said is very good. so we tailed them to the restaurant, which was quietly located, away from the hordes of tourists besetting zaanse schans. the building is absolutely gorgeous, named after the beautifully tiled fireplaces, and has an interesting histo "
"after walked from train station to windmills area in zaanse schans, my daughter and i felt hungry. then we decided to stop at one restaurant that we saw in our midway. it was nice place and cosy with wooden architecture. unique interior design made me feel comfortable and relax inside. we ordered drink and meals too. they have very delicious soup (in my opinion) which is very tasty. i forgot the name, it was kind of seafood soup. my daughter doesnt really like soup. but when she tasted mine, she definitely ordered another one for herself too. next time if i come back to netherlands, i really want to come to this place again and order the soup. the owner is kind and helpful too. price is reasonable. i recommend this place. "
"we had lunch here while visiting zaanse schans. a group of 9 of us and we sat at 2 separate tables beside each other because it wasnt originally planned to be so many of us. the food was great! the chicken nuggets are great - panko breaded white meat, not dry at all. the tomato basil soup was really good, and the curry chicken sandwich was great. the fries were also really good. good beer too! just a short walk over the bridge from zaanse schans."
"not sure if it was dutch cuisine but it was beyond amazing. my boyfriend and i stopped by this nice restaurant after our visit to the windmills across the river. we indulged on a space cake few hours before eating and got the best munchies ever! amazing appetizers, highly recommend the crispy beef wonton soup and the steak tartare, tasty bitterballen and delicious desserts!! we had the lemon pie and cheesecake. will definitaley come back if we have a chance. üëçüèª"
"delicious food, outstanding service and charming location. do yourself a favor and come to this amazing restaurant. we just loved it"
"ive landed in this cafe after a walk in zaanse schaans. it is a great place to chil out after visiting this beautiful area. try to have a table outside in the sun, enjoying a view of the near big windmill."
"happened to drive past this restaurant. its a bit of fusion with chinese food. real good quality ingredients and friendly service. happy to recommend to anyone looking for a good, wholesome meal for the family."
we saw this pretty little restaurant on our walk from the train station to the zaans museum. we popped in for coffees and liked it so much we returned for lunch. the staff were very friendly and helpful. everything from sandwiches and soup to pasta dishes and great desserts. beer on tap and the biggest toasted cheese sandwich i have ever had. all lovely. a very historic and pretty building and right opposite a huge windmill
"food is really good. i tried salmon as starter and fish of the day. all tasty and tempting presentation. a bit disappointed by the dessert, i ordered a carrot cake but tiny slices and more whipped cream and ice cream, nothing to complain about the presentation. highly recommended!"
"very friendly staff, popped in for a drink, would book lunch or dinner  if visiting windmills. relaxing place to sit, or have a fine dining experience"
"i have had the pleasure of eating here on more than one occasion, the chef and all the kitchen staff are amazing and so talented, the restaurant is beautiful and the menu is out of this world"
"really nice place, friendly staff, good food. free and good access to wifi. pop up for a coffee or a snack before or after visiting the windmills."
walk over the bridge from zaanse schans and across from the windmill is this delightful restaurant. a nice menu selection for lunch and dinner. we choose the salads and they were delicious. recommend by the locals for good reason.
"on a whim we decided to cycle to find some food on the last night of our holiday. we liked the look of the menu and decided to try it out. best way of describing the food would be a fusion of european and asian. starters were chinese vegetable dumplings and scallops. both dishes were well presented and very tasty. mains were lamb chops & roast duck in plum sauce. the duck was well cooked, tasty and tender. while i ordered the coconut milk pannacotta, my partner ordered the desert taster, expecting small portions of a sample of the deserts, what arrived was almost full portions of at least 5 dessert "
"just stopped for a drink after visiting the windmills. very well done up old place, lots of wood, nicely decorated."
"we were happy to have such a good diner with this place. the way the wines are described, was very good. to find words for a taste is rather unique. well done."
"when you travel the world as i do there is one thing that happens thats not so good, and that is that few places amaze me. this restaurant is the exception, it is utterly amazing!!!!! i loved it!! "
"we had taken the little ferry from zaanse schans on a whim. after wandering down a lovely small zaan region village we happened on de smuiger and decided to try it for lunch. the decor is lovely and has incorporated the features of the building and its history well. i ordered mustard soup with a salad that featured avocado and a light herbal dressing. my husband had a luncheon salad with thinly sliced tuna, monk fish, and pickled ginger. we both very much liked our choices. and the rolls were warm, served with a choice of garlic herbed butter or olive tapenade. service was warm and professional. definitely go here for lunch if in the neighborhood. it is just over the bridge from zaanse schans and to the left and across the street from a windmill."
dropped in for cuppaccino & soaked in the atmosphere of zaandijk. good break on the walking route around the windmill zone.
"this restaurant is located right across the bridge from the zaanseschans on the left side at the.traffic light. it serves lunch specials that are fusion with a hint of chinese. dutch, english and cantonese are spoken he "
"we stayed across the road & found this place one evening. we were lucky to get a table & were a bit worried bringing our toddler in. but the staff were so friendly & the food was amazing, & we had a great time! they offer 3 course meals with starter, main & dessert, but we avoid sugar so they allowed us to have a soup, starter & main instead. the soups were creamy & rich & delicious. the dumplings were so tasty - everything we had was absolutely amazing! lovely little area as well!"
we were staying in this area and were delighted to discover this delightful restaurant. we couldnt have been made more welcome. when she saw we were interested in the building our hostess showed us the cellar and the tiny bedroom! the food was the best we ate in a week in amsterdam! a must if you are visiting zaanse schans which is just down the road! the food is best described as chinese fusion.
we ate at de smuiger with two couples. the restaurant is located in a building typical for the area and breaths a monumental atmosphere. service was friendly and efficient. the menu contains set multiple course menus or you can select one by one. the food was very tasty and also the wine turned out really good. would return.
"i live in the neighborhood and we go here for dinner on special occasions, even x-mas! excellent food and very special ambiance. good to combine with a stroll at the zaanse schans, on your way to the railway station!"
"loved it - unique three, four or five course menus. attentive service and great dutch food. fancy place but were welcomed in jeans. reservations recommended but we got lucky with the last space availalbe"
"amazing food and service. loved the dishes we got to try with the family. this was our first night in arnhem, so glad we found this place to start off our vacation."
"we, party of four, opted for the lobster menu. refined taste and very well presented. good and affordable wine li "
"what a great surprise in the small village of oosterbeek to find such a wonderful restaurant. great service,, food cooked to perfection and a really nice atmosphere  will come back"
"very nice food, a surprising explosion of tastes. good service, peculiar colorful decor with quality materials. good selection of wines, we also got a free wine upgrade being the last clients. not to mention that after 8:30 pm this was the only open restaurant in the area (they kept us in until midnight)."
"amazing food and service, best umami taste ev "
walked miles from wolfheze to get here for evening meal because it was vegan friendl 
"i like tjoes restaurant because it is vegetarian and the food is of high quality. it has a menu fixe, different everyday. the menu is creative. the atmosphere is convivial and the service is warm and kind. it is the kind of little place in town that one wants to have around the corner: friendly, homey, delicious and healthy. and they have begun to sell local products as well."
"you will think its not easy to find a vegetarian restaurant in a small town like oosterbeek but youre wrong. tjoes offers you good, delicious vegetarian food. they have a daily menu so you dont need to choose one. all is fresh. service is very personally. the restaurant is not on the mainstreet but with your gps you will find it easily. by the way, the dessert is yummy. youd better make a reservation as it was quite busy that evening when were there."
"located on the weverstraat 20, tjoes is a small restaurant. you have only a day-menu, so the choice is easy. prices are reasonable and the food tastes good. what else do you want? it might sometimes be wise to make a reservation, but we could do without booking in advanced and enjoyed sitting on the big table. you can check the website for the daycourse."
i am a vegetarian and getting only vegetarian food with variety in netherlands was something difficult to find. my manager took me to this dutch vegetarian restaurant and i was really happy to end my day with a good vegetarian meal. the food served is fresh and tasty. i would love to go to this place for lunch or dinner atleast once a week or whenever i would vis 
"as a meat lover i was rather sceptical about going to a vegetarian restaurant. but what a nice surprise! the choice of the card is limited, which i see as a sign that what you will get is fresh. and everything was amazingly fresh and of very good quality. we had the daily menu of a vegetable flan, similar to a frittata, roasted winter vegetables and a lovely salad. all members of the family finished their plates with great joys (even the children who usually are not fond of vegetables!). we decided to go on with deserts. most of us had a wonderful chocolate truffle cake, with a deep taste of chocolate, that went well down with the vanilla ice cream. we also had a surprisingly wonderful orange parfait with a lavender sauce. all in all a wonderful evening out for a very affordable price. i had never thought i would enjoy, and stay full, like this after a vegetarian meal!"
we discovered this great little vegetarian restaurant in oosterbeek nl. not far from arnhem. it is not on a main road so you have to look for it. but it will be worth you whil 
"to be honest: we didnt expect much. the interior of the restaurant and the type of customers dining here didnt promise a lot. but the place was open and near our hotel. we didnt feel like looking around too much for a place to eat, so we took a chance "
"la maison is excellent and highly recommended when visiting oosterbeek. i was with a group of 18 people who arrived close to closing time and they were able to accommodate us - which is exceptional service. the food was delicious and well presented, with serving sizes that comfortably allow a two or three course meal. we liked it so much we went back a second time during our visit (and would go back again next time we are in oosterbeek)."
"this is a family owned restaurant, with an excellent menu, and very friendly staff. it is within 7 minutes cycling from the bilderberg hotel, and has an outside terrace. the food is excellent, which made us decide to come back the next evening of our stay. we can recommend the fish dishes, and for meat eaters the sateh, although everything looked good on the me "
"as a local we quite often go here for diner, especially when we have friends over at our place. la maison calls itself a brasserie that can be considered an understatement realizing the quality of food the restaurant provides. the menu offers a good variety of options rather you are a lover of meat, fish or vegetarian. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed; our 6 year old daughter loves to join us here as well. decoration is based on the la maison chain of interior stores of which one is situated next door."
"we had dinner on a busy saturday eve when many other restaurants were fully booked. service was very friendly and the meal great and reasonably priced: as starter lobster soup and goat-cheese and veal as mean course. the atmosphere is friendly. the only point of improvement is the acoustics, it can be pretty noisy. outside there is a nice terrace which must be great on a sunny day. "
"with a social deal we had a meal here for the first time. and after this meal it is definitely not the last time we will visit it. portions were very big, and tasted very well, staf was very friendly. so if you are in the neighbourhood you have to visit it"
"finding a restaurant is always fun , part of the pleasure is to see if the recommendations are to your taste , here it was .downside is the small menu ,so the picky diner has to compromise. food is good and well presented ."
we were visiting oosterbeek mainly to see the airborne museum and operation market garden sites. we were running late and did not get to have lunch until 4.00pm. we looked at the restaurant next door to the museum but the prices were astronomical so we walked further along the road and came across la maison. the place was empty except for the staff. we were quickly seen; our order was quickly taken and the food arrived in good time. the food was lovely and we had excellent service. we would recommend la maison to anyone who is visiting the the area.
stopped here for lunch while staying in oosterbeek. friendly staff spoke good english & we ordered a club sandwich & the house burger/frites. both were excellent with that netherlands twist that makes them a little difference from the usual fare.
a great little find. this is a boutique style restaurant in a quiet village. if you are near arnhem it is woth the 7km detour. food is great. prices are very good. staff are friendly.
the first night of our 14 day holidays in oosterbeek we opted to have dinner at la maison. lovely decor and lots of outdoor light fill the restaurant. the menu was divers and very reasonably priced. also our two daughters (10 & 12) found something of their likin 
"we had a meeting in oosterbeek for a next walking event. in preparation of a not really exciting moment we had dinner in this excellent restaurant. perfect attentive personnel, excellent food and  quiet ambiance. we will be back here for sure !!"
"we were walking back from oosterbeek towards arnhem, and came across this newly opened treasure. the food was freshly cooked, service was superb, they could not do enough to please. the dishes were absolutely delicious, and the presentation was excellent as you will see from my pictures!"
"came here for lunch with family, the main courses were okay. the pudding on the other hand (profiteroles) was delicious. good atmosphere"
"visited this restaurant spontaneously and had a very pleasant experience. all dishes (2x pancakes, 2x other mains) were delicious and served simultaneously. service was friendly and with a personal touch. prices are ok. the atmosphere is really cosy and welcoming. parking is available in front of the restaurant. recommended."
we stopped here for lunch on a saturday while visiting the airborne museum. my main course was okay (chicken satay). my pudding (profiteroles) was really gre 
"there are a lot of pancake restuarants. this is one of them. the menu is not different from other pancake restaurants. neither are the pancakes: they are good, but not excepttionally. the prices seem a bit high for the locatrion (samen prices as in amsterdam, but it is not amsterdam.. "
"ordered the chef‚Äôs menu - mushroom soup and salmon (fish of the day), and pork satay both dishes come with ample fried and a small salad. the house wine was excellent as well as the affligem 0% bee "
"on our short visit to holland , we stumbled on this cozy restaurant. we were surprised with the most tasteful pannekoeken"
"great place to eat, need to book if want to be inside at busy times. (always busy when we were there in september.) outside is covered and there are heaters. friendly professional staff, good menu."
we have visited here numerous occasions as part of a group on a battlefield tour and always been made extremely welcome. this is a jovial place with staff who are eager to please and good food (and beer) to complete the mix.
previous reviews looked good so we decided to try here we were not disappointed..party of 5 we had burgers x 2 pork satay x 1 chicken satay x 1 veggie burger x 1..all the food was well presented and everyones plate ended up empty! lovely food and the waitresses/waiter were extremley pleasant alongside the relaxed friendly atmosphere..we will be definately eating here again on our next visit.
"my wife and i ate here on the last night of a 6-night stay in belgium and holland. it was the best place on our trip - good hearty food (with a wide choice of pancakes as well), friendly and welcoming owners, and (as we found everywhere we went in holland) polite and helpful young table staff. if you are visiting arnhem and oostabeek we would thoroughly recommend you searching this place out - it is only a short walking distance from the airborne museu "
"we stayed here for two nights. the rooms were large and comfortable with good beds and a good bathroom. we even had a small balcony. the surroundings are magical! everywhere you go, you feel like youre in a fairytale. staff of the inn were friendly and breakfast was good."
"we had just gotten to oosterbeek, staying at the hotel de bilderberg. we wanted lunch but not at the hotel. de oude herbergh is a short walk away. the food was good and had a relaxed environment. the service was good. they have plenty of outside seating."
"wonderful pancakes, great prices, relaxed atmosphere. a real find. had a really nice evening with my son."
"we battled to find somewhere for an early breakfast around oosterbeek. our group of nine pitched up here just as the place opened for breakfast at 09.00. the staff looked a bit shell shocked & daunted by the prospect of having to cater for so many people so early in the working day but soon got into their stride & coped very well. we ordered a variety of dishes; fruit & yoghurt, cheese and ham croissants, eggs & bacon on toast - unfortunately the pancakes weren‚Äôt available until 11.00 hrs. coffees & teas & orange juice accompanied the meal. pleasant place with parking. "
"what‚Äôs not to like? excellent food, loaded pancakes or superb satay. omelettes or steak. there is something here for everyone. easy to park, tables inside or out. if you‚Äôve got a large group you need to expect to sit across a few tables- it‚Äôs easier in any case. fabulous service and musical entertainment with a little comedic flair. great food, lots of it and good beer. "
"we stopped at this restaurant twice whilst on an op. market garden tour, one one occasion we had snacks from the lunch menu , the pancakes were excellent, plate sized, very generous. the sandwiches were also tasty. friendly staff i would recommend."
"such a beautiful little place on a slightly busy corner.  you can enjoy drinks or a meal outside.  we had onion soup (top notch!) and pannekoeken, and they had an excellent portuguese wine by the glass."
"stopped here for lunch before heading to the airbourne museum and i can only say wow. the staff were very friendly, excellent english which was a pleasure as my dutch is non-existent. the atmosphere was excellent and the restaurant is large with lots of parki "
"a quaint restaurant caf√© at the side of the main road, with a good menu choice and with friendly and pleasant staff. the pancakes were excellent, and all meals served to our group of 4 were really nice. good value too. would definitely go back here again. car park was a little small. a popular spot for visiting cyclists."
after our visit to the airborne museum we chose to have lunch in this restaurant which is only two minutes by car down the roa 
we have enjoyed several delicious meals at de oude herbergh with excellent customer service every time.
"i had 2 lunches at this restaurant with excellent food both times. the fried mushrooms on toast were slightly spicy and the pancake with cheese,mushrooms, onions and bacon filled the large plate. on both visits the staff were friendly and welcoming."
"we were in the area for three days. we had every meal had at this place, including breakfa "
"we stayed in the b&b part of this place and we enjoyed the restaurant. we sat outside on a rainy day and enjoyed a few cocktails before ordering. the waiter talked us into ordering an ‚Äúoosterbeek pancake‚Äù. ok kind of hard to explain but i‚Äôll try. it is a fat crepe that is covered with different combinations of good things like meats, cheese, and vegetables. it is not folded and comes to the table flat. it was a lot of food and delicious. always like to try local food and this was really good. great restaurant with a great b&b; this place is a winner and i would come back again."
"very nice restaurant, there was nice, friendly atmosphere. our waitress was really friendly and helpful. food was delicious and drinks were good too."
"the pancake with mushrooms, bacon and egg was nice, but th√© pofertjes, oh my!!! the best of my life. ate a double portion and could come here everyday ! better i dont live here otherwise i would become huge ;)!!!"
"very nice restaurant with local flavor and excellent, very friendly, service. i had pork tenderloin skewer with peanut sauce, my wife had barbequed spareribs. both very tasty!"
"got to say that i dont know how original dutch restaurant looks like but i think this is pretty close. practical layout, big patio, staff with their stylish brown leather aprons and unique salty pancakes makes this restaurant a place to visit. been eating here regurarly between july-november 2016 and still not bounteous of their pancakes."
"also know as the pancake house the de oude herbergh (the old inn) has been in existence for over a hubdred years. the specialise in pancakes but also have a very good menu of other meals, the ribs being excellent. sander and miranda own the establishment and are excellent hosts if your in oosterbeek or even arnhem for a meal. its very busy at peak times so a reservation is generally needed. the staff speak in dutch english and german so no problems there. all in all well worth a visi "
"we went tonight for dinner, very good service and nice food, the prices are very good gor nl and very good quality of food. i recommend goat cheese salat and the fish."
"popped in here without a reservation and they managed to fit us in. was lovey to be able to sit outside on a sunny evening. the staff were friendly and helpful, very forgiving of my limited dutch. we had the carpaccio of beef and smoked salmon to start, both were really nice and generous portion sizes. the carpaccio was particularly good. then for mains the pork escalope was really good, the spare ribs were good enough but avoid if you dont like your sauce swee "
"we stopped here for lunch & were able to sit outside as the weather was warm. friendly attentive staff serving local food, beer & pancakes"
"the best thing about this restaurant is that they really think about the details. lots of toys for the children and a present when they leave, nougat and biscuits with your coffee. the food is mostly pancakes or traditional dutch/european cuisine. nothing too fancy but nice enough and friendly staff."
"came her whilst staying locally on business. staff were welcoming to a solo traveller and service was excellent. i ordered salmon which took a while to arrive but was obviously freshly cooked so excusable. fries were excellent and there was a pleasant salad as a side. sauce with the salmon was a sour creame and chive which worked well. salmon was a substantial size. desert menu was limited, as it has been all around here, but the creame br√ªl√©e i had was fine but not perfect. at 28 euros including a large fresh orange this was good val "
"recommend to everyone to try chefs soup (pea soup) and their pancakes, they are just amazing. the place is very cozy and the the service is also very good."
"enjoy good old fashioned comfort and hospitality. the name pannenkoekenrestaurant (aka pancake restaurant) does not do this place justice. we ate a lovely fish meal here (sliptong). you could even spend the night, because it is also a bed and breakfast. we would come back here again and order the same delicious meal."
"delicious food, friendly and efficient staff and superb value for money. the mustard soup and sate were excellent, the generous portions meant i didnt get to try the puddings."
"we loved the savoury pancakes, try the special pancake with spek, ham, cheese, onion and paprika. deliciou "
"staying at a nearby hotel, we passed this on our way into nearby arnhem. the terrace was rammed (friday night), so on our way back to the hotel, we stopped for a quick beer to browse the menu, hoping to book for saturday. the three of us all chose the ribs as they looked amazin "
"excellent service, great food, great wines, must go if you stay at the hotel. the scenery is very old style rustic and worthwile spending your night here."
we were looking for an authentic dutch dining experience and we found it at de oude herbergh. the menu is all in dutch but the wait staff was very helpful in deciphering the menu. the place was full on a thursday evening with dutch families.
we have eaten here several times as my wife loves their pancakes. in our experience it is best to reserve a table if you can although the hard working english speaking staff seem to find a table on most occasion 
"we didnt realize this was also a place to stay -- we had dinner here only. it was very good! we wanted the traditional pannenkoeken, and they did not disappoint! large portions -- more than we could eat. kind of like a pizza but on the pancake. our waitress was very helpful and spoke english. they were very busy -- full of locals which is always a good sign!"
"the westerbouwing is on a sandwall which was created in the ice-age and is in the middle of flat land this way the views over arnhem and nimwegen are spectacular. the restaurant itself is located more in the forrest in a fabulous building with a huge window, which gives the feeling that you are in the wood!!!"
i was particular about visiting this place since it has strategic importance in ‚Äú operation market garden‚Äù.being at a higher level than oosterbeek village it would have made immense sense for the british to occupy this ridge and have their hq here. it is not known why brits did not occupy this place. so i took the foot path from road in front of ferry point and climbed up to the top from where there is beautiful view of river front.there is function hall on top with activity only when functions are held there.
"have a meal, a drink or a coffee and consider what took place here in september 1944 - this is a prime site to have an overview of the events of those days."
the restaurant overlooks the rhine with magnificent views and for this that are interested it was the sight of german guns that overlooked the river where the paras retreated from in 1944. the terrace is very pleasant and popular and the beer very good.
"relax atmosphere, good service and nice choices. good location with many outdoor tables. good for kids and families. ice cream and potatoes chips are always a good choice"
"eventually the place to end up for a casual night out in elburg! either you are traveling solo or in a group, you are never alone. a very good selection of beers and other spirits in combination with very tasty dishes makes the tapperij the place to be‚Ä¶"
"we had a great time at this quirky little restaurant in elburg! you do indeed feel like being on an old ship, they have done great work recreating this cozy atmosphere. the staff was very nice and enthusiastic and the food is great. highly recommended!"
"cant comment on the food as we didnt eat here - that said the tables that were eating seemed very happy. went for drinks, & warmly welcomed. lovely ambience, oodles of charm and character.....happy to recommend it and look forward to returning one day."
sitting on the restaurant‚Äòs terrace in nice elburg on a lovely summer evening is a must for every vistor. food was good and the burger excellent -tasty meet. aperol was chilled and fresh.
nice and warm place in the middle of such a beautiful town - elburg. one can try typical elburg‚Äôs cake called - ‚Äúkloosterwegge‚Äù.
"we had lunch in this establishment, sat outside on the terrace and enjoyed the view. the lunch was delicious and the capacino really great..."
what is the right time to dine in the netherlands ? this was a great discovery after some afternoon drinks. we all decided to stay and what a find it was. service was outstanding with our wait staff spending time to translate the menu and make recommendations. rather than some rather ordinary food in other establishments our meals were tasty and showed the quality of local produce. this establishment must be visited if you are in town.
"lovely cozy restaurant in the historic heart of elburg. very cheerful and professional staff. all the food was great, well presented with fresh vegetable garnish and delicious sauces. we tried the porkloin with brie, wolffish with prawns and the sparerib "
nice restaurant to be seen. nice location and good atmosphere. good menu. good selection of drinks and beers. service is good. casual dressing.
one of the best restaurants in elburg. its location is really good. sitting outside when it is sunny is great. food are delicious and well served. staffs are nice and polite.
"we were two famielies with children. day was rainy so we looked for welcoming place to eat. the service was excellent and all dishes were tasty, rates very resonable.wi fi is strong and stable. very reccomend this place!"
"just a quick stop over on our way to zewolde, recommended in a sailing book about holla "
"we went there on easter monday for dinner and this choice was good. the food tasted very well and was prepared to perfection. a 3 course meal for ‚Ç¨ 26,50 brings a smile to the face, especially for this quali "
well equiped caf√© that deserves the prefix grand. bar has a great assortiment. friendly and nice staff. enjoyable public. perfect to meet before the ensuit cinema and after.
the food and service was excellent. all the meals i saw going to other tables looked good. we went to the bar next door another evening and the cinema which is all part of the same building. the films are all in english with subtitles so great for  
i dont think the dutch are known for their cuisine but the luxor does a nice job of presenting it with style and taste.
"what you see is what you get. not over pretentious. close to a wonderful hiking area this is a great place for a lunch and a belgian, dutch or german beer. friendly and swift service. not too forget great chats with other guests. dog and horse friendly. good kitchen. lovely icecream coupes. and did i mention reasonable prices? "
my husband and i are on low carbs lifestyle (not the strict one) & we wanted to eat out in our last evening in reuv 
nice to wok here. the food is variabel and the sauces are also very good. friendly people and always alot to do.
"there are 3 types of way the food is cooked here. tempura, wok and prepared. all of it is hot and tasty and you can go back again and again. good variety of things that can be cooked as you watch! clean tables and floors. staff were friendly and welcoming. they also do takeaway!"
"went just before christmas; was busier than expected. we had not made reservations, but could choose from three different tables. friendly personnel, swift service. staff knows what they are selling and give good information about their dish "
having heard good references on this place we decided to try it ourselves when we wanted to get together as nephew 
"great to enjoy italian food, specially when the restaurant maintains the no pizza standard. so its the antipasto, a primo and a secundo and the dolce afterwards. great smooth carpaccio, antipasto misto followed by some filled pasta or straight & specials e.g. their special al tartufo. the menu changes each month so dont expect the real treat, rodlofos veal liver, the fegato veneziana, to be there, but boy, did i enjoy that! the rag√∫ we had was a bit dull, had it ten times better in bologna, but you cant win them all. great open wines, fine cakes. a bit on the pricy side, but friendly professional crew."
limoncello for everybody by the owner. no discrepancy by table .  gives more klantvriendelijkheid.  see you  next time
"unlike many restaurants attached to hotels, this one is absolutely hu "
great place to have a lunch diner or breakfast  good staff and good food nice ambiance reasonally priced
"working together with van der valk on our events and meetings, means we spend a lot of time at their restaurant. thats far from a punishment! dinner is excellent and service is gre "
perhaps more suitable as a business hotel - but handy for delft and rotterdam not sure about the carpets in the bedrooms - slightly headache inducing
"i had dinner with business partners. the menu offers a nice variation of food, as well as nice wines. try out and enjoy!"
i have been using this hotel since 2010 not only for cricket teams and officials but also for personal friends from around the world. they ask always say you could not have found a better restaurant
when you order you will get your food quickly.. you have lots of variety.. look on there website for the menu! sometimes they offer special deals on it to! there are lots of not hotel guests dining here. one of the reason why is that its situated next to a highway. i love the free parking! make a reservation before !! they are mostly full everyday!!
suitable for business stays or family events. nice restaurant and a cosy bar with nice finger foods.
"visited the place with some business partners for a quick catchup after a meeting. always good if this can be combined with some food.   the variety is good, so is the quality, service and accommodation."
"the kitchen really delivers first class food, and quite fast. we were a group of 20 people, and the waiting time was surprisingly short. the main dishes were excellent, but they did not even come close to the desserts. the sweet department was just heavenly. even after several days i can still remember the lovely taste of the cheese cake with caramell and icecream... :-)"
ate here while on business. i had the steak which was cooked perfectly. no complaints- exactly what i needed. im deducting a star however as i was charged an extra ‚Ç¨1 for the mayonnaise that i hadnt asked for. small i know- but very sneaky! would eat here again. 
"overall we found the food here very good. the restaurant is surprising large and despite its size we were quickly served. the food was generous, but also a good dining quality e.g. my large piece of meat came with a delicious stuffed vol-au-vent. the complimentary side portions of potatoes and vegetables was also generous and tasty."
you take a risk when you arrive without reservation. make a phone-call before. especially in the weeke 
"this is really one of the best van der valk restaurants. been here several times, always rather fast and good quality of food (no luxury, but for the money you pay its really good). interesting menu, products seem fresh and they even offer some organic dishes! the only thing you have to watch out, is where you sit, dont sit too close to the door as it usually smells like swimming pool there :)"
great variety of menu. quality is high and service too. the staff is very friendly and the wines are of good quality. the restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and is very relaxed. good seating and pleasant surroundings.
what an amazing menu. there is everything that you could ask for or think of. service and quality is good. i bring any visiting family and friends here too. great birthday party packages too
"went here today with a friend of mine, real pancake love "
love tjis restaurant. great for family visits but also to treat my tourist friends when they are looking to eat proper pancakes.  but there is something for everyone and other meals can be served.  staff are friendly.  it can get busy so be prepared.
"ok i must admit i do not like pancakes...so it is really difficult for me judging this restaurant. the atmosphere is great, there is a little play area for kids and overall the good country decoration. there are many pancakes and they are really good."
nice restaurant with a little cheesy country/cowboy atmosphere.  the pancakes are very good and the wait staff attentive. you can get any combo of pancakes one desires.  the speck and kaas was very good  great place to take the kinders.
"nice staff (young) and always a coloring for the little kids, would you like a pancake with a childs face or a pancake with shawarma. plenty of choice and all pancakes are just as delicious"
nice place to have a dinner with family. this is my daughters favorate pan cake house in nederlands
situated pretty close to the highway a12 den haag and utrecht. lots of free parking places. walking to trainstation ypenburg 7 minut 
"once again here. nice food, nice staff, nice walk from delft. walk through a nice neighbourhood, along the water canals."
"we had a nice lunch at this restaurant. nothing fancy, but freshly made food, friendly service and - last but not least - you can bring your dog with you, and it will also get a warm welcome."
"enjoy the view, the sun, the beer, and the very, very good burger outside. if you are in the area, visit this beatiful spot. de vang has a nice staff and provide good lokal food in a very nice way. highly recommended on a sunny day."
"stopped today foe a hot chocolate and a latte, also a piece of apple cake and cream. the drinks were hot and the apple cake was excellent."
"we actually live about 200 metres from this restaurant. it has seen some changes over the year. lately, the menu has become a little bit more limited, but also a little bit more exclusive. no haute cuisine, but certainly a cut above your typical dutch eet-cafe type of place. it‚Äôs not chea "
everhthing is new and handmade fresh from own gardens and fresh herbs and spices. very fresh and good made food
"highly recommended! creative, tasty cuisine. the chef is talented. kind and excellent service!  it is worth spending lunch or dinner on the terrace when the weather is nice!"
we chanced upon this lovely restaurant while cycling in the area. the apple pie and corn bread is to die for and the staff were extremely helpful and kin 
what a super initiative from speksnijders and the lovely and helpful staff of their cafe en suit 
"onder de molen is a good place for special pancakes, served with a smile by a friendly crew. the pancakes are delicious, prices are very reasonable."
"as we were staying at de arendshoeve for my daughters wedding, we decided to have dinner at onder de molen which is on the same property and we were pleasantly surprised. the pancakes were delicious, the staff were friendly and we had a lovely get-together."
"good place to eat something, of course pancake are speciality but there are also other dishes available and desserts."
we visited in the afternoon for a drink and then in the evening for dinner. pancakes were delicious. we had the pancakes with the greek gyros and tzatziki. it was delicious and the meat was so tender. pudding saw us order a pancake with caramel sauce and an ice cream sundae. both went down well. i also liked the rose be 
"visited the pancake restaurant for a quick and easy evening  meal, good choice of both sweet and savory pancakes but drinks were a bit pricey. lovely location and good service. only downside was that they would only accept cash & not cards."
"very nice and tasty pancakes for a decent price. many variations available, including some specials. location under the mill is great and you can also visit the mill on request."
took our young grandchildren her for a friday lunchtime. service is by waiters from sheltered accommodation who do a good job. the pancakes are very filling and include a wide variety of sweet and savoury options.
"we wanted to try something local, so we went to this one for dinn "
we just stop by for pictures with the windmill but we had coffee and home made apple tart!! it was delicious. (friendly sta 
had our wedding reception there ...loved it...best pancakes in the world and wonderful people ...with big hearts ....lovely atmosphere
beautifully presented delicious food served by friendly knowledgeable helpers. the steak was as good as any i have eaten and that‚Äôs been a lot. the smoked salmon starter was served with a wasabi ice cream which was a new and a perfect compliment to the splendid fish. can‚Äôt recommend this eatery enough.
we came back to this restaurant following a specific request of our 16 years old daughter who enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. also this time the experience was nice and we had a good time. kind staff and nice ambience!
the restaurant is under new management and this draw a lot of customers: it was packed with people. however the service was still good: the staff paid attention to you. the food was great and tasteful. the portions are good.
"caught up with friends for dinner at hof21. sat on the roomy terrace. the food cooked by husband was delicious and the service by the wife was wonderful, very friendly. the atmosphere was lovely. highly recommended."
"this restaurant came as a very pleasant surprise, after a long day of client work in the local area and simply asking google what local eateries were open at 8pm on a sunday night. the waiters were extremely friendly, spoke fluent english, and helpfully translated the entire menu for me (although i was already convinced i wanted a steak with chips a soon as i walked through the door "
"the lunchroom is run by the krimpenerwaard day activity foundation, serving you with pleasure and a smile. nice tomato soup!"
we were staying at a b&b about 1 1/2 miles from lekkererk. we walked to the town in hopes of finding something to eat. we came across huisje van de zeeuw. as we were seated the waitress apologized that they did not have a menu in english only dutch. we told her it was ok and that we would figure it out with her help. they offered a 3 course meal with several selections in each course. everything we had was excellent and she provided great service. when it was time to pay i asked if they took a visa credit card and she did not know. so i opted to pay cash. a great place to get authentic dutch food and there were no tourists only locals in the restaurant.
"this past saturday we went for dinner along with couple who had highly recommended this place. it was a superb experience. the quality of the food, the ambiance and setting (we sat outdoors), were wonderful. most important, the service was excellent. the owners, a couple, took the time to check on us and our satisfaction. our server, sander, a young fellow, was on top of things and very attentive to our requests. thank you ett cafe de nar for the memories! even better when in the company of dear friends!"
"the food was excellent, fresh and sufficient. nice and friendly service plus the owner/cook informs about our satisfaction himself"
"staff very friendly , very good food , nice ambiance , highly recomended. we spend a few days in a hotel in the neighbourhood , the food was bad so we were lucky to find the nar."
a lovely old world dutch restaura 
"really good peolpe, good food and nice old ducht house. highly recomended, specially fish from the north sea. thanks!üòÅ"
"after a stroll we walked into the eet cafe and what a delight. full of locals, comfortable atmosphere, pleasant host and service. the food was excellent as was the beer. we left saying that was good local experience"
"arrived that day from canada. tired, needing food and rest. i had pork medallions she had steak. both were done to perfection and beautifully presented with a side plate of fries, baked potato wedges and salad. overall probably the best value meal during a week in nl. belgium and france. around $60 euro for two with drinks and tip."
very friendly service. meal of the day is always very good and of high quality at a reasonable price level. the restaurant as a very nice atmosphere and you feel like home.
excellent food in a friendly place.you can sit in the garden if you like. you should definitely eat here when you are in the neighberhood of lekkerkerk.
we came here on kingsday. the waiters were  really nice and the special menu was very delicious. thank you for this nice dinner.
we ate at the eetcafe de nar for 4 nights during our stay in lekkerkerk as the restaurant at the fletcher hotel restaurant de witte brug did not live up to its alleged reputati 
"i found this restaurant whilst looking into the village of lekkerkerk as we were staying at the local hotel , de witte brug, for a couple of nights. we did not book as intended to eat here on a thursday evening. when we arrived the restaurant was full, but the owner beckoned us in from the doorway and offered us drinks at the bar as a table would soon be free. we accepted and were extremely glad we did. the food was excellent. service was as laid back as you expect in holland and just how we like it! the owner was very hospitable, even showing us around his garden terrace at the rear of the property, used for outdoor dining in summer. would highly recommend eetcafe de nar if you are ever in the area, excellent food, not badly priced."
typical old dutch cafe... we loved the atmosphere! and i had the best  uitsmijter ever.  do not miss this one whenever in the neighborhood!!!
dont expect a 4* restaurant and you wont be disappointed. staff was friendly and ready for service. nice wine and good food. we had the pepper steak and pork tenderloin which were really good taste wise. the pepper steak was slightly too cold but when we let the staff know we got a nice compensation which we felt wasnt necessary. desert was also very nice. kletskoppen tart and coffee with treats. we enjoyed this evening very much and recommend this place when in the ijssel-lek area.
"the food is great, as well as the ambiance. also a very nice place for a birthday party or reception. nice to have a cosy restaurant nearby!"
"while this is not some french 3 star restaurant, it is a great restaurant for good food in a neat environment (at reasonable cost). it is in a smaller community slightly east of rotterdam. the drive to it can be along the dike road with the interesting scenery of that route. its location in a smaller community caused me to think that most of its business would be a relatively local clientele-------thus necessitating good food and serve. i was corre "
had a nice piece of fish cooked to perfection. the place was very warm and cozy on this cold winter evening. the waitress were very nice.
"had lazy afternoon tea where you get to enjoy small pieces of different cakes. brownies was really tasty and chocolate they use is tony chocolony. moreover, it comes with a glass of tea. a social responsible concept restaura "
"i booked meiden van de molen for a private company event, ca 30 people. the owners linda, dick and fleur created an amazing evening for us - delicious food, great service, and a beautiful venue with great ambiance. the shared dining concept is really good, with interesting and diverse dishes all equally delicious. great value for money also - really not expensive for what it is. dick and linda were very friendly, communicative and accommodating and i am so glad i decided on their restaurant! cannot recommend it enough!"
"because of corona, we ordered a menu for dinner. it was really delicious, the foods well selected and innovative combined. i especially liked the dessert: yoghurt-gember-limoentaart met een dadel-notenbodem met limoenijs. if i could wish me a birthday cake, it would be that one!"
"surprising menu idea, it already was hard to imagine a preference for the christmas menu presented on the website. to our surprise, all dishes from the menu were served at the table. delicious dishes which formed a great combination. we all enjoyed the food and the evening. the dessert was also completely served, even with a musical surprise at the table. thank you for this wonderful christm "
top for the mid range food selections !! every time we are surprised by the quality of the self created listings !
"meiden van de molen means windmill girls. the windmill is cosy and has a cosy bar (nice bites!), separate upstairs for groups and restaurant. we had some drinks in the bar and were warm welcomed. staff is more than friendly and super attentive. only one look is sufficient to come to your tab "
"quite nice and cosy, with friendly staff and good meals. a good variety of food with matching wines. the bar is separated from the restaurant, making it very comfortable for both visiting groups. we will be coming back here."
"last night of our holiday,we booked our table for 1800hrs and had a very pleasant time during our st "
"very good service, fresh and tasty plates.  the atmosphere and the personnel offers you a very nice experience. for sure we‚Äôll visit again"
friendly staff that made customer feel welcome. lovely fresh food that tasted great. i would recommend eating here
when christmasshopping is at its peak you need to eat. take a quick break at delifrance for a sandwich or soup. friendly staff and nice price
"very much choise and the price is good,nice atmosfere , near the hotel i stayed in the shopping area"
"our friend lives nearby and four of us booked a table for dinner and the service was good and the selection of food was fine.we selected the house red wine and it was nice.  would we return yes,this was our second visit."
our friend lives nearby it was our tre 
"went here with a group of friends, and really enjoyed it. the food is simple and straightforward but good, and very reasonably priced. staff were very friendly as well. i will definitely be returning."
visited with dutch friend.   italian food was first class and very reasonably priced.   the restuarants was very busy which showed how popular the place is.   will certainly visit again.
"i really like this restaurant. the food is delicious, staff is friendly and helpful. the prices are very affordable.   i recommend it to all my friends and family all the time."
"i frequently visited this great place, for a good meal. my favorite food here is the curry chicken chips. the staff is friendly, mel is great! usually there is a trad session on the first sunday in the month. i surely recommend this place!"
although i live nearby i had never visited this place. they have a nice choice of foods and drinks. the staff is very friendly and helpful. ill definitely revisit!
"all irish breakfast including blackpudding, just brilliant! cant wait for the irish stew! great atmosphere, thans mel!"
"we have been dining here for many years, food is always good quality and not expensive.  friendly italian owner.  decor has recently been updated.  also has a take away with excellent pizzas."
"la sirena offers the best pizza in the area. the ingredients are fresh, the crust is crispy. people are all friendly!"
"good food for a fair price. very friendly owner, waiters and waitresses, nice atmosphere in restaurant."
"la sirena has good pastas, pizzas and other little dishes. the restaurant isnt that big but youre not sitting on your neighbours lap. the staff is also friendly."
we have been coming here for many years  and are still very satisfied with the quality of the meals. they serve a wide variety of different authentic greek dishes. the service is very friendly. the restaurant is run by a greek family.
"nice restaurant for business- purposes, not a romantic one. very good service and typical greek-dishes."
"and very nice, friendly service and staff! food was excellent. we enjoyed the visit very much! price-quality was very good."
"we have been going there for several times now, and funnily enough we have always taken the same dishes. my friend is fan of moussaka which is absolutely lovely here, it is not swimming in fat, it is fluffy and delicious, and i am fan of gyros with tsaziki. every time we have been there it was always the same quality and the service is friendly and fa "
"i really, really love this plac "
one of my favorite indonesian restaurants in the netherland. authentic indonesian food for a nice price. :)
"this restaurant may small, but always bus "
real indonesian taste as it should be. i think pempek elysha should be ranked higher. we live in belgium but frequently visit the hague.... and pempek elysha. my personal favorit; iga kambing bakar
"we went for early dinner and this small restaurant was cramped. the tables were filled with mostly indonesian guests. that says something about the food. luckily there was still one table available for us. the ikan bakar (grilled fish), pempek adaan (fried fish cakes) and nasi goreng ikan asin (fried rice with salted fish) were exquisite! generous plates with authentic flavors. "
the best indonesian food ive had so far in netherlands!!!! well prepared and very good flavor. service was good too. reservation is required as usually packed. good parking spaces outside.
"hands down the only resto i would visit for authentic indonesian food! either you are indonesians abroard missing home cooking or someone looking to spice up your spice buds, come to this plac "
a small indonesian restaurant with authentic taste indonesian food. here you can enjoy a variety of indonesian typical dishes that you dont easily find in other indonesian restaurant in the netherlands. make sure you make a reservation because they have limited tables and let them know when you bring baby stroller so you get a table with easy acce 
"excellent food served in an atmosphere similar to a warung in indonesia. it would be even better, if the set menus would have more vegetables and less meat as options."
this catering/mini restaurant is one of my favorite indonesian food. i live nearby within a walking distance and so i either take home or just sit at a simple table (they have a few) and enjoy a warm delicious meal. there is not one dish i do not like. they make every day fresh dishes in the bustling kitchen at the back. i had once catered from them a whole buffet and the ladies came with their indonesian garments and served the guests. extremely friendly and clean. highly recommended. i believe they close at 19:00 or 20:00 hrs - check opening hours on their website.
here you can buy the best indonesian food in the netherlands. the staff loves to serve the customers and always gives me a little extra.
i always go there for indonesian food.... go there its a real gem. best place in the hague area for indonesian food. (winter can be cold;-) in the restaurant)
"we ordered an assortment of indonesian dishes for a birthday celebration. the food was delivered to our home in time, and was set up in our garden. compliments to the chef, the food was delicious!"
"i would recommend the take away service. the warung is simple and crowded, the good thing is the foof. delicious dishes for take away, supposed to be one of the best in the region."
"great take away, make sure you go before 5.30pm, after that it can get very busy. since being voted best indonesian take away in the netherlands, it has gotten much busier. anyway, they deserve the title, the food is very good. try the sate kambing. delicious! "
i am told by officienados that this is the best indonesian take out (with very limited and basic eat in) in the hague. i have used 3 local voorburg ones and it is the best of those but not the cheapest. there is usually a queue so that would seem to suggest that it is popular. 
it is one of the best tokos for indonesian food i know. great choices and very nice staff.  their are more than 50 choices.
excellent genuine indonesian food! good quality for a good price. they catered several time a party at our home. all our guests were very pleased and full of compliments to the chef. that is why they are the absolute nr 1!
according tot a yearly review of dutch indonesion food restaurants and take away (toko) toko menteng is the absolute nr1 for two years in a row.
we order very often at toko menteng. the service is very friendly & the food tastes wonderful! to cater a party can delight your evening  as wel!
"genuine indonesian food, freshly made with authentic ingredients: no wonder toko menteng is voted to be the best toko of the netherlands!"
"nice small toko with low prices under ‚Ç¨ 10,- and youll have taste explosion in your mouth. not really a restaurant."
"after reading the reviews, i decided to have  lunch.  the food was excellent many choices and the tempeh was also very good.  it is a small restaurant with some places to sit,  but perfect.  hope to be back soon"
well prepared and reasonably priced authentic delicious indonesian food. has to compete with popular toko nearby but withstands the competition well
good food and nice price nice location in village of voorburg...people vers nice and friendly. opening times good zeven days a week lunch also etc.
"an authentic indonesian toko. since i have indonesian ancestors, and i frequently cook indonesian food myself, and i went to visit indonesia for a month, i think i am a fairy good judge. toko menteng were ranked 3rd best in the country by a specialist website. the food is really excellent, very authentic, and affordable. eating at the toko is possible, they have 2 or 3 tables, but its more a take-away. a very, very good take-away! "
"we likes the indonishian takeaway. the restaurant had many customers (which we thought was a good sign), and we really liked the food. it was spicy and there was plen "
"the restaurant is part of shopping centre julianabaan. parking spaces are available. the setting is traditional for a chinese restaurant. unusual is that every customer can use the buffet for appetizers, dinners and dessert. the customer pays a standard tariff and extra for drinks. the food is quite good and is regularly updated. the dishes are the usual in a chinese restaurant, but taste quite good. prices are moderate. you can spend as much time as you like."
we chanced upon the r√∂se garden in an effort to find a good chinese place without the hassle of den haag parking. thankfully it was a sunday so there was not a lot of people. food was pretty amazing and all freshly prepared. definitely would like to go back aga 
"went there for a takeaway lunch for 6, and we had the best egg rolls ever, served with a delicious sauce."
booked a table in advance thou the place was not very busy when we walked in. had a nice table of six.the service was very good. food was perfect. nothing to complain about.enjoyed it and recommend to visit if youre in voorburg.
"rosa garden has been there for several decades and is one of my favorite restaurants in the the hague area. recently they reduced there price for the buffet, which the restaurant has during weekend and public holidays. the starterts at the buffet are great, with sushi, sharkvin soup, and dutch style salade. the main dishes are good, although i found it a bit to much meat orriented and missed spiced and stirr fried vegatables. the desserts are very good. the price qualtity is excellent. it is a bargain for what you get. highly recommended."
"i have three teenage sons and they love nothing more than a lunch at stuut with the traditional dutch menu, especially the uitsmijter. it is delicious and filling. the service is friendly here too and feels like an old fashioned milkbar."
"i came here frequently with me parents over a decade ago. recently i went here again, and they still got it.  staff was very friendly, the food was great and affordable, and the preparation time was great. great place for a quick snack :)"
"for a real treat of the the typical dutsch fast food, patates frites, meatbals and kroket, but also fast meals, go to stuut! near the central station of voorburg/"
if you like authentic dutch food stop here for a quick meal. the service is fast and the food is always good. i like to order a fried egg and ham sandwich and a coffee for breakfast before i board the train.
"excellent snackbar. great selection of the traditional dutch cuisine. excellent fries! very friendly staff, clean saloon, quick service and great snacks. plenty of parking available. go almost every week as it is close to my work. stuut is maybe the oldest snackbar in the region."
"typical old school snackbar and i recommend it highly if you are in for frites, a good  broodje warm vlees, hamburgers, kroketten or uitsmijters or just coffee and a sandwich. the frites are fresh cut and well-fried and all ingredients in all dishes are daily fresh. conveniently located near public transportation and with free hr parking."
"ive been here on a weekend day to have lunch. the food was great, i had a very tasty chicken and fries. the staff was also very friendly, i have nothing to complain about. it is located right next to voorburg station and you can park your car for free with a blue parking dis "
a very nice location on one of the old centre streets in voorburg. this lunchroom has a wide selection of tasty dishes. during the afternoon the sun hits you perfectly on their terrace. very friendly staff. good fresh food. defintately coming back here!
love the food here. i visited multiple times and i‚Äôm never disappointed. especially the goat cheese and avocado baguette is great. definitely recommend!
we visited ‚Äòaan de tafel‚Äô on a sunday afternoon when most eateries were closed. it was busy but with a good number of tables there was still room outside and inside the rstaurant. friendly service. someone offered help with the wifi. cappuccino was good and the club sandwiches were ok. i appreciated the salmon club variation was built with only a tiny bit of onion and well balanced in ingredients. overall it was ok.
"cozy atmosphere. nice staff. we had green tea, fresh, rootsliced, ginger tea and a doppio -double espresso- with water on the side. for lunch we had tomato soup, tonno venneto - and filet americain sandwiches served with rocket."
we had a french union soup and an ommelet with cheese and ham at this restaurant. it was very well prepared and very tasty. the service is very polite.  they have toys with which the children can play.
we had lunch hete totdat. we rally liked the menu with many good options. also nice fresh juices. a relaxed place for a good relaxed lunch!
"i have known this place for some time but never had breakfast. if you are staying somewhere in voorburg and want to have a great breakfast, go there. i mean, skip the hotel one because this is great. scrambled eggs, bread, ham, cheese and many other things. amazing and a lot to eat. know it for having a coffee, sandwich during the day and that is also great. relaxing place, no nonsense!"
"always friendly staff.  the aaan de tafel breakfast special is always delicious with plenty of ham, cheese and fresh brown bread."
the best meal we had in a long time.  best mussel pot i have ever had.   lovely relaxing atmosphere. we will definitely put this one at the top of our visit again list.
"we came here with a social deal. tucked away near the train station voorburg this is a small little restaurant, modern, contemporary, clean, quaint. it will fit about 50 people. we ordered a hamburger and entrec√¥te steak and had a latte and brownie for desse "
"if you live in the area and feel like eating out without too much fuss, this is your place. its under the train station, so trains literally pass above your head. but we liked that! we had a well done and a medium steak, both ok. the staff were polite but by no meas welcoming or friendly. just doing their job. however if you take the effort to go to the hague city center there are certainly better choices."
"dining at the village lounge is always a nice experience. the location is both good and bad: good because its near some office buildings and because when the weather is good, you can sit outside and enjoy a nice view. its also at the end of a nice shopping street. and there is plenty of free parking right outside the restaurant. bad because its underneath the railway station, which can be noisy. also the a12 motorway is running over the restaurant which makes it a bit dark. the service is excellent and so is the food at the village lounge. we had grilled tuna as a starter, and fish (my wife) ans pepper steak (me) as a main course. all very tasty, fresh, well prepared and good size portions. the petit grand dessert was also a treat and after a very good cup of coffee we left the restaurant and were very happy. oh and we also had a bottle of white wine and a glass of red with the steak. nice house wines at ok prices."
a great little cafe and lunch spot. the staff are very friendly and it appears that most clientele are regula 
"my parents use this cafe as their regular haunt and i have been a number of times myself. the food is always lovely, im partial to a club sandwich or surf & turf salad (divine). the service is always great too. its not just a lunch place though, you can pop in for coffee and cakes too!"
"we use toko eddo 6 to 10 times a year - plenty of variety, and with our firm favourite being chicken cashew - the full rijsttafel is available, as well choosing slightly different options - they delivery locally for free, and don‚Äôt charge too much for den haag addresses."
very tasty kip cashew! nobody should omit that one! nice personnel! good service also for take a way!
"the food is good and the staff are extremely helpful! when we asked about a particular dish they gave us samples to taste before we purchased! many of the dishes in the case are cold; however, they were more than willing to heat them up for us quickly. if you want some good carryout and don‚Äôt want to sit in a restaurant, this is a good place!"
we like to order the chicken cashew and gado gado and bali stew accompanied with nasi goreng or bami goreng.
"famous for their chicken cashew, eddo has been around in voorburg for a long time. but they dropped places significantly on the national best toko list. there are reasons for this, not in the least the growing stiff competition in town over the last few years. but eddo still offers good food. the service is somewhat chaotic sometimes (double check if you have everything before leaving with your take away) and they are expensive if you make the mistake of ordering all separate dishes instead of menus. but that last fact doesnt only apply to them. parking in front of the store is a problem. best to go on foot or bike if you live in the neighborhood. "
"excellent indonesian take away food. also possibility to eat there, more snackbar like then restaurant. very reasonable prices for fresh and tasteful food."
we go there a lot we love their indonesian food.kip cachou is one of our favorite.i really advise you to try.
"after renovation the place looks much better. it is always busy so a long waiting time....also the people who work there are not so quick. the chickencashew is what they are famous for! my dad cookes really great indonesian food, so i do not go there for food except the cashew.....i think the prices are a little high for take out.....but that is my opinion. the risolles i would not recommend them."
great indonesian takeaway. we have now ordered from here three times in the lockdown. it‚Äôs a really good delivery service. the food is delicious. we often order the rijsttafel set meal for vegetarians. it‚Äôs great. it compares really well to other indonesian food we have had. 
brilliant take away service. we had a second take away from here tonight. i am so impressed with this place. they phone to check an item that wasn‚Äôt available. and i‚Äôm sure they brought more than we ordere 
we go all the time. fresh food. generous portions. nice variety. very friendly staff. free parking. small eat-in area but we mostly carryout. convenient location with free parking and near bus and tram.
"had lunch here with a friend. we had a complete rice table. loved it! great quality food, enough to be completely full. very friendly personnel that gave great advice.  also pretty cheap in my opinion!"
"was looking for some good indonesian food in leidschendam-voorburg where in general the options for decent restaurants are limited at best and generally overpriced. since we had a visitor, we wanted to go for indonesian food. however, since we have young kids, we ended up going to a place to pick up food and bring home. most of the places weve tried are either too greasy or just overpriced. found this place through google search and it was not too far aw "
we live nearby and go here very often. other la cubanitas are not this good - which is probably why this restaurant is always full. food quality is super and cocktails are good. we love a good moscow mule. carpaccio and cuban stew are the best dishes but if you love seafood order shrimps. the spicy shrimp is delicio 
"went here tonight w 5 friends. the place was a buzz of activity. we ordered from menu while waiting to be seated. once seated - 10 minutes after arrival on a friday night - the plates appeared on our table. a huge assortment of tasty dishes and a very friendly wait staff. an evening full of fun, good food, and friendship! will definitely return next time visiting voorburg!"
"we visited on a busy saturday evening, i would recommend you book a table at the weekend as it was super busy and people were turned aw "
"went there with two work colleagues. the place has atmosphere and a buzz about it - not high end - but it does what it does very well. it is set up as a cuban tapas restaurant. it runs an all you can eat model for 17.5 euros plus drinks, the value is very good and the selection varied. a key part of the fun is trying the dishes - hot, cold, fish, meat, veg - all good. the staff were also very good. so in summary - good food, interesting experience and good service. i see some comments on the variance in the food - but this is part of the charm."
"ordered butter chicken for my wife and chicken vindaloo for myself, my favourite curry. asked if it could be made very spicy and i certainly was! however, i did miss some other indian spices to accompany the dish, so it did taste a bit monotonous. my wife loved here butter chicken. "
indian cuisine with a compact menu. husband in the kitchen and mom serving. willing to adapt the menu to you taste should you wish something made less of more spic 
"tucked away in a small shopping area, this place is great. looks like a takeaway from the outside but it‚Äôs a lovely restaurant. not posh but fabulous food and flavours. waitress helped us select food for kids too. well worth a visit!"
"hidden behind a supermarket in the midst of apartment blocks one can find this indian/nepalese restaurant. small in size, relative simple interior one can get an awesome indian food experience. we had a lovely tandoor chicken, very juicy. well marinated, grilled to perfection in the tandoor oven. in addition we had lamb tikka, samosa, onion nan bread, mixed vegetables with curry and basmati rice. all perfectly cooked. service is charming and prompt. perhaps not five star in interior but definitely in food. highly recommended. "
"great food, decent prices. free parking. tram stop across the street. could have more attentive service and serve tap water. little gem in mostly bland voorburg."
"thank you very much for the nice evening and the delicious pizza. super service and beautiful premises, the store is also excellent."
"da tano is named after the italian chef and owner, we very much enjoyed the fresh italian dishes, the nice atmosphere and the sunny terrace in the lively centre of sassenheim."
"this  is a very pleasant restaurant with a delicious lunch  menu.  the service is faultless and the ambiance  plesant specially on the terrace, which is adjacent to  small marina.  we wanted to be surprised and so we were in a most delightful way"
"lovely place for breakfast/lunch in sassenheim.  delicious salmon, wonderful coffee.  outside tables near the water.  helpful waitstaff.  clean and inviting.  loved it!"
brasserie hemels is set in the middle of sassenheim which is a lovely town and well worth explori 
"food is great. waitstaff is amazing; lots of patience and friendly demeanor. unfortunately there is no english menu, only dutch."
nice terrace with sunset. good service personnell the ice cream is nice with a lot of variaty and coffee tastes good. not suitable for dinner.
i generally dont really care for ice cream. but i make an exception for de zoete inval. all ice cream is freshly made and it is absolutely delicious. strawberry ice cream actually tastes like strawberries. they have an excellent collection of flavors and there are always a few unexpected surprises. and a nice bonus: its cheap! especially for what you get! 
"we went here on a saturday morning, not busy at all. the waitresses were very friendly and professional. the selection of cakes was fine, with different tastes - for example cheesecake and choc brownie. the coffee is served with a tiny ice cream on the side, which made this visit memorable. all in all a nice coffee shop, just of the main squire. happ to visit again"
this is a great new place specialized in own made ice cream and great coffee. the place is very popular in the summer and on a hot day be aware that some time in the queue is part of the experience.
"mochacino, icecream, cheesecake... all of them are surprisingly delicious. the service is polite. you can even drink hot schweppes lemon. :) really nice place for a breakfast."
"housemade icecream is the best in town (and wide environment). just delicious and wide variety + original tastes. best coffee in town as well, no doubt. good spot for lunch and high tea as well. value for money but not cheap and no reason for being cheap either. young and enthousiastic team but they do know what they are doing. all is just fine."
"its the best restaurant with greek food  i ever visited, nice fresh food, family/kids friendly and good place for events, birthday, parties and everything. the service is excellent they treat you with joy."
"nice place, excellent service, very very delicious food! the best greek restaurant in this town - highly recommended!"
"it was an excellent experience from this restaurant. family friendly, fast workers and clean place. i recommend you to visit it for experience greek vibes and greek cuisine."
that experience was very nice.the food was delicious.is the best greek food that i have tasted in the netherlands.the service was friendly and fast.i will visit it again for sure.  i definitely recommend it!
"the food quality, service and atmosphere are exceptional and a great value. we truly enjoyed our evening at this restaurant. highly recommended!!!"
"the place is great, great hospitality, the food was amazing!!one of the best greek restaurants i ever been in holland!!"
"the food was very tasty!the chef is really good.also,the atmosphere  was so friendly...thank you very much guys for this experience!!!"
"good food for a reasonable price. very friendly service. i liked most the zucchini burgers as appetizer, the lamb chops were also good."
"i was late from work on the way home. stopped at the highway restaurant in bodegraven. they had a discount meal of ‚Ç¨10,-. it was a small fresh salad at the saladbar, fries from belgium and a beef with butter. good meat. i only had to buy a drink"
after a bike ride we decided to stop here for dinner. we didnt have to wait long to order a bacon cheese burger and fries. the staff is friendly. what i also like is that you can sit in a busy part of the restaurant or more secluded. we will definitly visit again. the meal tasted fresh and delicious.
"we wanted to eat at a proper pancake house and this was recommended. four adults ordered and three of us were convinced we each had the best. pancake roma, kapsalon (shoarma, fries, cheese!), pancake with cheese and pineapple. the servings were huge. less happy was the shoarma special gent, but it was till very good - we did share!. the two kids had cheese sandwiches which were quite disappointing - a bit dry and firm. the children werent worried as the fries were good and there is a good playground where they played for an hour while we relaxed! was possibly a bit expensive by our standards, but who knows......"
we went eating with a couple of frien 
we have visited this restaurant in our last day in netherlands it is located in tge center of a very nice town. the food was very good also for the children. the waiter was very nice and helpful.
my first experience about this place was for v-day dinner with my gf.. second was with my gfs family. both had really great time in he 
"these people understand what its all about. we went out with friends and had a wonderful evening. nice atmosphere. good food. nice selection of nl tappas (small dishes) to choose from. brand beer and nice wines. price / quality in balance. staff was present and available but not pushing. just as it should be. anders - bodegraven, the place to be!! will we be back? no doubt."
"excellent place to go, nice crew and food! they also have good wines, and its located nearby the railway station. the restaurant is also attainable by boat, as it is situated along river oude rijn."
"i went to the restaurant with my girlfriend. we had a great spot outside. good thing is that in the evening, it is still sunny at most seats outsid "
"we live in the town bodegraven and we like this restaurant. overall the food is very good, although the menu hardly varies during the year and hasnt really changed since the restaurant opened 2,5 years ago. as we have two small children, we dont go out to dinner very often, this doesnt bother  "
traveling through europe the last couple of weeks this was the best food we have had. i had the duck and my friend had the chicken. absolutly delicious! the staff were friendly and proffesional.
people are very enthousiastic and loving their job. staff pays attention to details like setting tables with glove 
"‚Äò‚Äòthis comfortable- gezellig ( for you dutch patrons) resturaunt is situated on a lovely canal. the staff, very much, makes this a wonderful dinning experience. am i allowed to say ‚Äúnot all dutch restaurants & not all dutch servers‚Äù are service oriented. this restaurant seems to specialize in service! i was fortunate to eat here, two nights in a row, while they had their rare buffet nights. the chef is proud to describe his selections. they taste even better than they look. i have included pictures. they have an extensive dessert selection as well as 8 different after dinner coffee "
"you probably walk just by, since the restaurant is hidden away from the main road, but situated next to the small river oude rijn which splits the village of bodegraven in h "
"great spot on the market square. we stopped here for a coffee with cake in the morning. the cakes are mainly cream cakes from a local bakery, fresh and yummy. service was a bit slow and not very engaging, but fine. coffee tasted good"
"at the grand caf√© we discovered an utterly fantastic vintage-dated beer from wild yeast, the striffe hendrick. must be rare and small production as our attempts to later locate it at retail in amsterdam failed. but at least we had it, thanks to the great beer selection here and the recommendation of the friendly guys at the table next to us. great people-watching from outdoor tables!"
"missed the chance to try their pancakh as it is only serve before 17:00. but, i noticed there are lot of homemade food here. first time, we are little bit conservative and only ordered fried food. the taste is good. our dog seems enjoy being here because of nice food smellüòÑ"
"if you place a reservation 2 days in advance the chef will surprise you with an awesome vegan menu: all fresh, regional, saisonal and highly creative. one of our absolute favorites!"
"this restaurant doesnt gets lot of reviews,but,their rank is at number 3. i am very curious to know what would get. it turns out brilliant resultüëç. the restaurant prepared the free appetizer is special and delicious. we cant wait for the main course. now,i sort of understand why there are not too many people wrote comment, it can be either most customers are local or everyone enjoy the food and environment too much and nobody gets extract energy to do it "
this restaurant has an incredible chef. its great when you go to a restaurant and you have each time a culinary surprise.  having a menu where youre going  to get something new and exciting.
excellent food and atmosphere. nice and quiet surrounding with good and speedy service. the owner is the kitchen chef so that tells you he is destined for quality.
"its rare to find a korean restaurant nearby.the staffs are extremely friendly. the food is good, different from my experience in korea. however, its good anyway."
great koreaan restaurant from the outside you would not recognise this type of restaurant.but when you enter a warm welcome by the staff we were here with a group of people we ordered the menu whow what a flavours and structures.we will come back.
i absolutely love having dinner here. any excuse to get together with friends includes coming back to this restaurant. i normally gather a group of 6-10 friends and it becomes a fun dinner part 
"went there on a monday evening. the hostess gave us a very warm welcome and made us feel at home instantly. we decided to take two starters, the kimchi soup and the spring-roll (which actually consists of 2 spring-rolls). for our main course we had the spicy chicken and the regular chicken. to our surprise we first received a free appetizer: spicy fish in a fried filo pastry bag. due to the size of it, appetizer was not the correct term. the food was fantastic. perfectly seasoned and balanced in flavour. the portions of our main dish were big, in fact we asked for a doggy bag and enjoyed the rest the day after. when we were finished, we were offered a tiny drink on the house. meanwhile the restaurant was quite full of other guest "
visit this restaurant. very friendly people. is also hotel with rooms. menu is very nice with fish and meat. parking is close. also possibility to sit outside. for sure something to come back.
"dining two evenings in a row over here, superb is a good qualificati "
"for a real good and properly served dinner, you are at the right place.  better even, they use real freerange eggs and other real food.  service is, as already mentioned, high level and you will enjoy taking your friends and  family there."
"the menu is small, but everything is homemade and fresh. may be a little old fashioned but the food,drink and service is second to none . my friends and family eat here a couple of times a year."
"had lunch with husband here. a gorgeous free shrimp salad. a bit pricey, but delicious. my husband went for the traditional fried egg and ham plate.  v dry good"
no nonsense but best quality food. a special aperitive drink is the 4 years old bols corenwyn genever. goes fine with some seafood.
"located in a charming little village, i was pleasantly surprised to find such a good restaurant. very warm welcome, perfect service, quality and freshness of products. and all this for an affortable price. i shall return to this restaurant with pleasure."
"hotel with restaurant, both very high ranked. very nice place to eat, profesional staff. have eaten twice here. both times good quality, quite some fish and local dishes."
"we had lunch in loesjes again yesterday on our annual visit to oostburg to stock up with goodies from albert heijn. it was very, very busy but the staff did an excellent job in catering for everyo "
"we visit oostburg once or twice per annum as it has the closest albert heijn supermarket to the uk! sad i know but we do miss sate saus, sambal, varieties of dutch cheese and other goodies which we miss since we used to live in  "
"we were driving back from holland to calais and in need of a pit stop. after finding one small town completely shut up, we drove into oostburg, parked near the shopping precinct and found this nice litlle cafe a few yards away. our home made rolls were very tasty ( excellent bread) and service was good."
"great place to have one of their sandwiches, which are made right before you. also nice terrace where you can enjoy the shopping people. is also in the market area"
great lunchroom with a lot of flavoured pies and authentic cakes nice area with nice places to order your lovly lunch or a nice salad bread.we went for a coffee with a delicous pie with a zeeuwse bolus with custartd creme delicious never seen this before this local speciality.very helpfull and friendly personell great place to visit in oostburg
"excellent food, service, and atmosphere. prices are medium range and certainly justified by the very good quality food.  wey friendly staff. a very good place also for families with kids."
"on the way to zeebrugge, we randomly drove into oostburg for a leisurely stroll and lun "
"came for boerendag. grabbed a bite while i was there. got the fisherman. absolutely delicious! also loved the cole slaw that came with it and the jar it came in was a nice touch. great place to sit outside, overnight the square. great food. great time. "
"just went there to have a coffe, but it looks very nice, especialy on market day, sitting outside on the terrace in the sun, watching all that goes by."
we had a nice evening with very good food.  we like the atmosphere and the service was also very fine.
"friendly business, somewhere between a restaurant, caf√© and a traiteur. friendly folks are passionately running it and they prepare most of the racions/tapas/boccadillos themselves. their menu goes far beyond the standard palette of dishes that virtually every tapas restaurant in the world serves. i think this is the first time in my life that ive eaten *real* spanish/catalan food (not some kind of westernised 1-dimensional copy of it) outside spa "
"if you like to have original spanish food in a cosy restaurant, la cosina de espana is the place. no fastfood, but real taste."
"visited the historical city of ijsselstein. have been to this restaurant before and what a difference! the restaurant has been modernized, which has made it a lot more spaceous.   food was good, did not have to wait long. friendly staff."
this is an excellent restaurant with friendly sta 
every time i come for a meal at this awesome italian restaurant the service has never failed me. always friendly always eager to serve dont wait long for service or long for scrumptious italian meal. good going guys. really fantastic. will always come here for a meal. 
"excellent food, friendly environment, menu in dutch (as expected) but easy to translate with your google translate app! best dishes were the sliders! wings were delicious, and waiter was very helpful and provided excellent service."
lovely clean cafe / restaurant with a great atmosphere. indoor and outdoor dini 
"we had a dinner here. we arrived pretty late for the netherlands, but they kept open the kitchen for us. we had a meat and a satay; just simply but well done both. goode service, honest price: we will pass again"
"we went there for lunch and had a chicken club sandwich and a pork belly sandwich. the chicken sandwich came with fries. what can i say everything was well prepared, simple but with excellent taste combinations"
first of all let me start by saying the location is not the best but the venue makes up for that! the hospitality is fantastic and the way they treat the children is one of a kind!
lovely meal at a very affordable rate. food was wide ranging predominately of asian cuisine. all dishes ordered by our party were well presented and of high quality. service was very friendly. it would be recommended as the restaurant is small that table are reserved in advance. would definitely visit again.
excellent food. reserve as you may not find a place.. prices are reasonable. i recommend this restaurant if you looking to eat some good indian food.
the diner was fine and very friendly served. the restaurant is nice furnised. good place for a good asean meal
"it was a nice little restaurant, with just 10 tables i guess. the staff was nice and friendly. they explained everything and make a little chat with you. the food was really good, for a really good price. i will come back there."
la place is located just off the highway. we had their brunch special ($4.97) if ordered before 11:30am. you have a variety of things to choose from plus orange juice. i had coffee which was made to order and my wife had hot cocoa made by melting milk chocolate cubes with hot milk. both drinks were great. they also have fresh pastries that looked wonderful. everything is served buffet style. we are going back for dinner. when in the area make time for an enjoyable tasty stop. 
"the la place concept is simple dishes some pre-made, nicely presented, cooked by cheap staff. pizza, wok, grill go together and are pleasantly priced. the concept sees to it that meals are delivered at low cost. dont expect too much. this is the only eatery in this small village but there are better ones in maarn just a few kms to the west on a local road."
just the normal la place concept. good food for a good price. if you dont want to cook and just go out to get a fresh meal this is a good option at a good place near the highway. we choose always a meal with coupons and you can eat almost for 10 euros per person. 
ideal for a quick lunch or to work a bit. lovely terrace too. friendly staff. its self service and good quality. loved the xxl size fresh organge juice!
"loved the fact that the restaurant is using fresh ingredients for the dishes, i liked the deserts for the fact they didnt have tons of sugar in them like usual.  the meat wasnt the greatest, probably for the same reason. the pizza is wonderful."
"vast choice of wok, pasta, grill, pizza... etc. you choose what to take from wide selection and you meal is cooked while waiting. good food, fast service."
"if i dont have time to prepare food, this is a healthy alternative. easy access, right on the exit of the a 12 of maarsbergen. it is possible to eat in- and outside. i would rather go to la place then to a snackbar as it is nice, clean, healthy foods and a nice ambiance."
"the restaurant offers a buffet service. salad, soups, pizzas, sandwiches and cooked meals. good ice creams too. very child friendly. very close to the a12 motorway."
"had lunch here yesterday, and various times before, always good and fresh food available, friendly staff, and a nice terras to sit and eat outside!  will certainly visit again!"
"it is relatively fast food. you order and wait for the order to be prepared, tray in hand. depending on the plate you ordered and the waiting line, this can take 5-10 minutes up to 30 minutes when it is bu "
great place when youre have kids. lot of entertainment for them. the pancakes are good. not special or something like that. but a great spot to eat.
"relaxed atmosphere and great place for kids: there was a workshop table to decorate your own easter egg and the playground area where kids were enjoying themselves while parents could enjoy a great brunch, full of nice details. the staff were awesome, willing to help in english when we didnt understand dutch. good pancakes. a paradise for families in the heart of castellum!"
the battle of the pancakes houses around utrecht is fitter and this is one of the better ones. great facilities for kids and friendly staff make for an easy choice.
"i was here with my wife and we enjoyed the food sooo much! we both took three little dishes. i tasted all six and it was stunningly good!!! lamb chops amazing, steak tartare amazing, the fish was amazing... pfff what a great food! also the service was nice. only disappointing thing was they don‚Äôt have a wine card. with such great food i would invest in a nice selection of wines."
it was an amazing night. in my opinion the food was amazing. everyone found something to eat. my table was amazing there were ballons and  serviettes with 16 on it ü•≥üëåüèΩ
"amazing food!!! nice service but ong the food was so good! we ordered bread, mea, zalm and cheescake and we will come back!"
"top quality restaurant, either for lunch, dinner or take away: its always such a treat! lovely personeel in a beautiful atmosphere."
"first time diner at teus. courses were fine, it looks they are trying to go for a michelin star. i believe they need to put focus a bit more. to many tastes on the plate. the crew is friendly but paying not enough attention to the people. to many people in the restaurant, not enough people to ser "
"really enjoyed our business diner bij teus. wonderful concept, a homely atmosphere, a wonderful and original surprise dinner prepared in an open kitchen. also enjoyed the original wines. the restaurant offers half glasses so one can enjoy a pairing wine with all the courses. really recommend this restaurant but expect booking is essential!"
"straight forward high quality, well served, surprising food in an off-houten (generally middle of the road location) atmosphere and setting. feels more metropolitan than the suburban location sets expectations for. sexy interior, great food and very good choice of wines. a true culinary experience made practical and easy by the staff who engage in a small dialogue with you to advise and jointly agree on choice of food and wine. we had a great evening together and would certainly reccommend making a reservation here!"
conception great. you are filing like in home. waitress and wine expert like invisible bees doing their work. food is really tasty and portion is not so big. nice for relax and eat tasty food.
"our son who lives in houton took us to this fantastic restaurant. what an experience, no menu, the waiter just ask how many courses and if there is anything you dont eat. the waiter then brings you course after course of incredible food with a discription and a wine that compliments the food. expensive but as i wasnt paying i didnt see the bill. great food, fantastic service and not rushed, we went for 5 courses and it was a four hour night out. you ring the front doorbell and you are greeted as a friend that has been invited to dinner. in to the lounge for a drink and then into the restaurant for a great meal. i cant t recommend this place highly enough. well done bij teus."
"first you enter in a kind of living or a bar for a drink. when youre up to diner youll be seated to a nice table in a different setting. we chose a 4 course diner. all very good. taste and colour well presented. nice friendly staff, they all enjoyed it. we will come back for sure"
"this restaurant has it all. relaxing ex-industrial designer lounge interior, friendly and cheerful service, open kitchen, and not to forget: beautiful dishes. rather small portions, but rich in colours, tastes and flavours."
the welcome was friendly and cosy. the food was delicious and presented as a gift. i can advise you to go here for a delicious diner!
this is an excellent place. food is superb and the atmosphere is super relaxed. ive been here for 4 or 5 times now and its been great every single ti 
great restaurant in the centre of houten. its an old car shop and youll be seated around the large kitchen watching the activity. you can choose between 3 and 7 courses and for every course theres a matching wine recommended by very knowledgeable staff.
"very nice diner in a great looking reataurant. former garage, turned into a beautiful restaurant. we ate upstairs where it was very hot... (summer). you may want to make sure you eat outide or downstairs when its ho "
"formerly a gas station in the heart of houten, they have a concept: fusion, sophisticated food. you get to pick just the number of dishes, rest is a surprise. well done service, kind staff and...they even speak italian!"
"these guys have a concept. a former gas station was carefully redesigned into a lofty restaurant. giving the place an instant hipster ambience, exemplified by the waiting area for aperitifs, styled like a living room. the big green eggs dominate the kitchen, which is centered in the dining space, so you can see how your meal is prepared. there is a walk-in cellar where you can pick your own favorite wine to accompany original and delicious fo "
"dinner at teus is always a pleasure. a warm welcome awaits you at his front door, after which your first drink will be served in his cosy living room. after that you are invited to his surprisingly spacious restaurant where chef martin and his team serves the best food in town!"
"interesting concept. good ambience. good selection of wine. great food. friendly staff. however, we seemed to wait ages between courses. definitely not the place to go if youre very hungry."
bij teus is the restaurant in the village of houten with a unique approach. its like visiting your friend at home. the place is organized like a living room with casual easy-going service. the menu is extensive with superb usage of the big green egg. recommended!
i frequently stay in houten and for client dinners usually resort to having to head into utrec 
very good foods served with originality.  high quality for both fish and meat. a step below the dessert.  nice also the location: informal and refined at the same time.
"the idea is to be at home at teus. this is the way we were received, first in the living room.  and then in the kitchen. see how the food is prepared. nice view. and the food: excellent. tastefull. go and experience!!!"
"second time ive eaten here. both times have been corporate meals with a minimum of 9 people. as others stated not what you expect from the outside but once inside a great atmosphere and an experience with course and wines able to be matched, courses are in line with a fine dining taster experience, each course explained by your serv "
in this restaurant you feel like you are sitting in the kitchen and that you are part of the kitchen. the restaurant is in a very special building (an old garage). the restaurant has a huge open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant. the reception is in an actual livingroom where you can have a drink. then the ambiance changes when you go to the actual restaurant. the menu is great and they like to surprise you with dishes. we did this and it was amazing. combined with a very nice wine selection. the price is good.
"knowledge about the wine is poor, but good enough for a good fit with the excellent food. enough vegetables! very friendly service and not too present!"
"first thing is that is really easy to miss. it looks just like a house, any other dutch house with big windows. but it is a restaurant. first youre welcome at the living room, get a drink and have some time there. once youre finish with your drink, you are transferred to the dinning are "
"despite the title of my review, i had a great evening at the restaurant. we were welcomed by our host who provided us with a small glass of roasted onion soup (very good). it took a while before we were seated. the food and the service was great. eventough we had a set menu, there was enough choice for people who either did not like one of the options or just wanted something else. i was told the wine was great, but since i was driving had not the opportunity to try it myself. after 3.5 hours i left the restaurant content and with plans to come back with my family."
"i rarely post remarks of my trip, however, i have to do it because this restaurant is a very very good one. at the begining, i was a little bit lost as a foreigner. the entrance looks like somebodys small cosy house entrance, then you hesitate to push the ring button and you are questionning yourself is it that place ? finally i saw a couple of people rung on the door and a waiter (maybe the owner) opened the door and welcomed us warm "
"people that want a change from the ordinary, will be pleased by going to bij teus in houten nl. a new concept restaurant with the kitchen as centre. innovative dishes in a surrounding different from the usual. the front facade is almost antique, but once inside the change into modern architecture is impressive. a lounge area in the front part, with the restaurant in the back, that formerly as a garage workshop served. impressive is the huge pencil drawing on the wall expressing a roman era bathing facility. which actually this site in the ancient days has been. the food quality is good and the service correct although a bit slow. well-recommended."
this is a nice relax restaurant which serves local products. its a nice place to go out if you are in the area of houten but i wouldnt go out of my way to go here.
"going on an afternoon or early night for a drink we always and up with annelies, the owner of the zwijger. relaxed , comfortable and cosy, we feel at home here. being welcomed with your favourable drink, some peanuts and a smile, thats where you go for if you go for the zwijger. off course there is the good food but you go mainly for the atmosphere."
"a nice local pub in the heart of the old village, that serves an extensive range of (local) beers. when in the pub you should definitely try the local beers of the hommeles brewery. their range contains some interesting bee "
ive been here a few times for coffee. the staff is friendly. there is a good choice of teas and coffees and delicious cakes.
hands down the best coffee in houten. they also do a man carrot cake!  what more do you need from cafe. recommended for all coffee lovers.
great staff and an excellent selection of coffee and something sweet to eat. all their cakes are freshly baked.
"really nice place to be.. drink a delicious coffee, eat some home made bread and enjoy the good vibes around you :)!! and nice staff.."
i travel for work to and from different locations in the netherlands. joinn ha been a perfect choi 
stayed there two times already on a long term (9 months) st 
"this venture is very central located. i come here often to do business. the coffee is delicious! and of course their famous cheesecake, unbelievelably good. also the restaurant is really nice. fair prices for really tasty food. they use a lot of food / ingredients which are provided by local farmers and entepreneurs."
"i had a fantastic time while having lunch, kings day party, drinks or attending the crazy piano show. the staff is excellent! moreover, i stayed for 7 months in their studio apartment. i requested to stay in the same apartment that was showed to me, 307. i really loved the place. it has everything you need for a temporary stay and it gives this warm and cosy feeling like being home. not to mention the location is so excellent: close to supermarkets, the grand caf√©, dry cleaner, tailor, photographer in case you need to prepare for a visa application. and makes it easy to travel to the rest of the cities in netherlands. i left the place with 27 boxes and you will wonder where they all fit in the apartment?! it is because of the really well designed and thought through elements that makes it so convenient and easy accessible for instance cooking without feeling overcrowded. the storage is great without making the place look messy. and being a woman you can imagine the amount of things one requires on daily basis! :) i liked the fact that i had sunshine coming in, the balcony access and both doors opening, the window shades for a great dark room so needed for a good night sleep. enough number of plugs and well positioned. just perfect! i recommend it for anybody that wants to start a life in netherlands. it really offers the ground base of stability needed. i just know if i ever decide to move back to netherlands, ill start at joinn!"
temporary accommodation for 7 months. in between house moves. would recommend xl loft for long stay. very comfortable. staff very friendly and great atmosphere. for business or pleasure great location.  food and service excellent in cafe/restaurant on site. free parking
"limited but good choice of dishes, also vegetarian. food and drinks at mid-range prices but well served. good coffee too."
"although there is a restaurant on site, they have short term or long term lofts above the restaurant. we stayed in a 3rd floor loft. like a bachelor apartment. modern decor exactly like the photos on their website. mini fridge, dishwasher, cooktop with a fully equipped kitchen. shopping & grocery stores within a block. located directly across from the houten train station. we did not need to rent a car. biked everywhere. safe & secure as you need door card to use elevator up. we ate a few times in the restaurant. nice to sit outside."
"a few times a year we hang out with friends to drink something in the evening. instead of going to the same place every time, we decided to not go to de zwijger, but to joinn instead. its a very small bar place, where you can also have lunch breakfast and diner. service was good, drinks were nice and the even made cocktails we requested and were not on the menu. the only down side is the size of the place, its very small. keep that in mind when going there without a reservation. so, when its not too crowded we would sure visit again some time. "
"when we want to celebrate my wife and i usually seek out out a greek restaurant. parthenon is one of our favourites. the atmosphere is always very welcoming and the menu offers a great variety of dishes, both traditional greek and more popular mixed grill dishes."
a nice restaurant with an attractive menu. warm atmosphere. food is very good and service attentive by nice staff. fair prices. also a great place for a warm winter drink after spending time outside.
well-known place. used to be a village type of hotel + restaurant but the new team of owners have succeeded in transforming the restaurant into a modern place but with classic touch and warm pallet of colours.
"many positive points for this restaurant. easy to reach, being located at a thoroughfare, a large free parking area in front of the restaurant, inside is the restaurant light and spacious and the service is friendly and homely. this good service may justly be emphasized, because good service in certainly not standard in dutch restaurants. however, about the food, there is room for improvement. portions are small and the food is maybe a bit bland. generally, the bill in dutch restaurants have been elevated from the usual very high to the level of eye-watering due to the round of inflation in the netherlands and bergzicht is no exception. however, weighing the pros and cons i really can recommend bergzicht for a stop over, just scraping home with a narrow four points rating."
"this is such a cute place, the staff is friendly and the food is great! your mouth can start watering from the moment you sit down :-) the prices are also very reasonable. i recommend this for any pancake lover!"
second time we have been here. it was very busy this time.  staff were unflustered despite a busy evening. we were seated. served in good time. food was good. good range of pancakes and fillings. we hope to come back again when at henschotermeer.
"very friendly staff, nice location, even ok to sit outside while a bit chilly. very busy of course, but they managed to seat us. for larger groups; book in advance!"
we have eaten here regularly and keep coming back. the service is good and correct. the food is fine. they have two other locations where we have come. also there it was fine.
"set in a beautiful forest, this friendly place serves right up to expectations. kids love it. dont go here if youre looking for anything stylish and quiet :-)"
"very scenic location, close to pyramide van austerlitz, excellent ambiance, very pleasant and friendly staff. good variety of pan cakes and omelets, very good coffee. overall must visit place if you are in this region."
"had a nice lunch with a group of friends before heading onwards to amersfoort. all pannenkoeken tried were delicious and prices seemed quite reasonable! service was helpful and friendly but not everyone could speak english but we were offered english-language menus. restaurant itself is on a highway between doorn and amersfoort and is quite spacious. i would like to rate it more of a good than very good and it certainly was more than average. when it came time to pay or it was clear we were done, the service was tad slow but otherwise it was nice lunch stop to eat some typical dutch food and i have logged several visits to the netherlands"
had a light lunch at this restaurant around the corn 
very beautiful surroundings as well as interior. kind service with a smile. good coffee and ‚Äúappeltaart‚Äù. super cozy experience overall.
"you can choose five dishes at a time, five times over. we were ravenous, but only managed two rounds of some wonderful dishes. we enjoyed the dutch take on oriental food, as a welcome change from what we usually get in the uk. our waiter was charming, helpful and chatty (but not too much) and the bill, including drinks, of ‚Ç¨50 was good value for excellent food and very fast service."
"all-you-can-eat-concept is a challange if you want to use the card to its full extend. i wish you good luck. and then you can still take dessert. everything was very tastfull, portions were big enough and there was a huge variety of choise."
"weve been here several times, and the staff is always friendly, there is a great menu (all you can eat sushi for only 24 euros). the sushi itself is not that great but the grilled dishes are (such as lamb chops, peking duck, et "
"this is one of the new sushi all you can eat restaurants in the netherlands. originally a chinese restaurant, now converted into a japanese restauran "
chalet helenaheuvel is located in the woods of doorn. the chalet is excellent for a drink or lunch after your walk. very busy during sunny weekend days!
great place for a relaxing coffee and cake during a forest walk. the view from the balcony is magnificent
"what a lovely view your have from the restaurant and terrace here! it is a lively place for walkers, but can also be accessed by car."
"the pancakes are a must eat, i am dutch living in the usa but this location is not to be missed. enjoy the journey getting there. climb the nearby tower de kaap and you will have a great 360 degree view of the area. try the local beers on tap, you can walk for a while in s beautiful park"
"we stopped for a late lunch so the choice was a little restricted. saying that from a full menu i would still have chosen the colour palette*. freshly prepared with great ingredients, it was a welcome change to the normal dutch menu. a little pricey but you get what you pay for he "
"brilliant fresh juices; oranje boven. great sandwiches with fresh, high quality toppings. bread is very nice as well.  service is very friendly and attentive in this small place. terrace in the sun, provided the sun shines."
froukje is a hole in the wall coffee shop with a personal touch and warm cozy feel. the hosts are always very friendly and personable. in my opinion the coffee is up there with the best in the world.
just a bit of sunshine is sufficient to enjoy frouckes nice (heated) terrace. she serves genuine natural food.
ive been to froukes a few times and it never disappoints. she serves excellent coffee and it is a charming pla 
"what a lovely place to get some coffee and sandwich. i had the cappuccino with some soy milk and hummus, avocado, aragula sandwich and it was delicious. stylish little place with a great service! id definitely go back."
"friendly service and great coffee! and the treats are irresistible üòã the only place in town where you can get a scrumptious soy latte and a gluten free banana cake, yum!"
"everything fresh with very good coffee, actually the best coffeee in the area as it is properly made. the lunches are very tasty with fresh ingredients. can sometimes be busy as it is not big."
"we visited this place early in the evening, and the waitress kindly helped us heating up the pre cooked meal for our toddler. the tables were wide apart but still our kid could enjoy the kids playground. the food (pasta ravioli dish and chicken sateh) were lovely. also they took care of the covid measures: there were hand sanitizers, and visits to small toilet spaces were restricted/organised by a cap, there was additional terrace space outside, meals were served with distancing) "
"we moved to the netherlands from belgium and have been going here a couple times a week all through summer. the ice cream is great especially lemon pie, pistachio and coffee (although i wouldnt combine those). scoop size is heavily dependent on the employee (and they seem to have a lot of different ones). overall, highly recommend."
we went there after a business meeting and we really enjoyed the very dutch informal atmoshere and the great food.
we came here as the restaurant beside the hotel was fu 
this is nog a regular pancake restaurant. you can also chose different menu‚Äôs which is nice in you nog fancy pancakes... 
we took a bit of a detour to just enjoy the environment and stumbled upon this pancake place. it was quiet inside but the interior looked very nice and it smelled good t 
"this is a great place to eat great pancakes. i had a savory pancake with bacon, pine nuts, goats cheese, sun dried tomatoes etc. what a feast. my sister had a sweet pancake - lots of stroop applied. our dutch friends also had savoury pancakes. a large restaurant with outside eating places for those who wished to dine outside. the staff were very helpful offering an english menu to help with our translation from the dutch menu card. we had delicious ice cream to follow. all in all well worth a visit. keep up the good work!"
"i have been at this pancake restaurant 3 times during the last 6 months. 2 times with family and 1 time with customers. we all really enjoyed the food. one time it was clear that there is a farm nearby the restaurant, but it is not disturbing in my opinion. loved the pancakes and will certainly come back again."
"this is a place with a range of wonderful produce, much of it of local origin. the staff are very helpful and welcoming. the location is great, on the edge of the countryside. its really worth a visit!"
"if yo uare looking for somewhere to have lunch in veenendaal, then look no further than lef! with the demise of v&d, there has been a huge gap left in the lunch market and sadly there is not much choice in the centre. but, now we have lef! fresh food, locally sourced, prepared in the open kitchen so you can watch your food being prepared. smoothies for every palate. and also for children who have there own area in which to play. so, next time you are hungry in veenendaal, walk past mcdonalds and go to the place one door down and you will be most pleasantly surprised."
"this pancake restaurant has a varied menu, of course all kind of pancakes but also other food. both inside and outside there is plenty of space for the kids to play. i recommend this place for familiedinners, etc."
"on a nice sunny springday we went to this restaurant with one of the grandchildren. the restaurant is sacious, very wel equipped inside and outside for young children. a playground outside is one of the attractions while the (grand)parents have a great view on their kids. the pancakes are well cooked and tasty, the ambiance very pleasnat in a lush green surrounding and the service is okay. recommended, especially with young kids."
"a very busy evening it was, dozens of eaters in. waitresses were doing a great job. food okay, a bit bland though. they charge for tap water in refilled bottles."
"this tapas-restaurant is different from the regular tapas-restaurants. lots of space, nice personnel, good tasting food. but... to make a reservation at this restaurant it looks like you have to try that almost two months in advance!  worth a try :-)"
"the food in this restaurant is very tasty and good quality indian. the mixed platter for starters comes with 5 variously pieces of meat, all spiced differently and all very good. the lamb madras was delicious but spicier than expected ( even though it only had 1 üî• indicator "
"nicely decorated, spacious indian place. very friendly and helpful staff. opened 7 days a week. our first visi. we had a mixed platter, just to get to know the kitchen. curry‚Äôs and chicken were very good. deserts - not spectaculair - but certainly a place to explore. "
"my family and i grabbed a table here for dinner staff was extremely friendly. the food was rather good as well. we ordered dishes we wouldn‚Äôt normally, and although i like dishes more spicy, they were lovely to eat. would recommend."
"we booked namastey last moment fancying indian dinner which we did not have long time.  great welcome, nice restaurant, slightly noisy in the beginning.  the staff was extremely friendly, the food we liked and very well explained by the staff.  good experience."
second visit. we decided to go there without reservation. no problem. again good food. really worth trying to go and explore the indian kitchen
"the restaurant is only opened recently. we know the indian kitchen a little, so we have been waiting to try this restaurant "
first time visit but wont be our last. two dishes on one plate. eat with your utensils given to you at birth. very tasty food very friendly people serving.. a must go to restaurant
"friends of ours invited us for dinner at this restaurant, which serves african food. well, the food is spot-on, especially considering the very reasonable price. the only possible downside is the fact that you are supposed to share the food and use your fingers rather than a knife and fork."
"we have eaten there once now. african food is a very welcome surprise. the tastes are so different of what you are used fro in mostly french and asian kitchens.  staff is friendly, good service"
so good that eating out is possible again. we really enjoyed a generous pork filet and a most tasty pizza.
"walked past this place many times but only visited first time this week with family. we all went for pizza and they were amazing - just right, crispy thin crust not too much tomato sauce . we got some nice warm bread to start with for free, which was a real nice gesture. pizzas are big so i didn‚Äôt have space for dessert but some in our party did and they liked them a lot. service was also very good "
"a very nice and comfortable restaurant with the allure of a grand caf√©. a wide and delicious variety of well thought of food. friendly staff. we also had a party in the basement afterwards, which was great too."
"visited buena vista for a quick dinner on a monday. everything was great, and the portions were really big. we ordered a starter of nachos but this wasnt really necessary. good price and quality combination with friendly people."
"amazing! there are no other words that can describe this restaurant.  the food was fantastic, awesome staff and such a nice environment! and also the bar-man was so extremely nice and funny and made our visit memorable!  this restaurant is a have to!"
"we had dinner with 7. ordered the tapas-combo. nachos, soup, a selection of cold tapas, a selection of warm tapas, dessert and finally coffee/tea. we all had more than enough. it all tasted fine and looked ni "
"my husband and i have been living in rijssen (a little city in the east of the netherlands) for just over 4 months now. we have been looking for a nice restaurant to go to whenever we have something to celebrate or to treat ourselves. this past weekend we tried buena vista and wow! what a lovely discovery!! we walked in to find a restaurant nearly packed to the brim but the waiting staff found us a table and promptly brought us there. we had a look at their menus and they have a really wide variety of dishes and drinks. we ordered drinks and a tapas to start with. despite it taking a bit long to arrive, it was delicious (we had chicken bites with honey mustard sauce)! we decided then and there that well be back to have only tapas. we both ordered a pork dish as a main and we had it infront of us in no time! it was absolutely lovely. it had enough sauce, wasnt dry at all, it had some veggies on the plate and there was a side order of fries and salad. after all that delicious food, we decided to have dessert. my husband had tiramisu and i had creme brulee with ice cream. i didnt want the ice cream as mentioned on the menu and it was no problem at all to have it substituted by a different flavour. the creme brulee was bit of a let-down but i thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream. all in all it was a wonderful dinner and night out. they service was good and the atmosphere very relaxed. one little negative was that the music was a little too loud which prompted everyone to speak louder and the lights were too dim (my husband couldnt read the small print on the menu). buena vista also has a party hall which is directly adjacent to the restaurant but this was no problem as we never heard any loud noises or rowdy behavior. i would definitely visit this restaurant again but think that next time well reserve a table to avoid disappointment (i consider us lucky that we got a table so quickly this time)."
the atmosphere was relaxed and the service friendly and prompt. the menu choice was ok and the prices reasonable.  one disappointment was the quality of the fried potatoes - greasy and not crispy.  i would also advise management to include oat milk on the menu.
a very tasty sandwich and iced tea on the terrace. perfect lunch on a sunny afternoon. a lovely waitress helped us with the menu as like most brits we speak virtually no dutch.
"sat down for a coffee and something sweet. the terrace at the front is accessible to strollers (which we had). the bigger terrace in the back was also accessible to strollers, but you had to walk to the back and someone had to open the gate for you. that was too much hassle for me on that warm day. coffee was ok. had a crepe with nutella and ice cream, that was ok as well. it did not impress me. however it‚Äôs a great looking place/building and the staff was very friendly. "
my family and i ate here and absolutely loved the food. it is a really nice place to be and the staff were really friendly and attentive. if i lived in the area i would come here often.
"my family and i had the set menu this evening and cant stop talking about the creativity, presentation and quality. the staff are professional and very friendly. great place! best restaurant weve been to in holland so far, by far. loads of charm too."
i went here last july with my family and enjoyed the warm and friendly service. the food was delicious.
nice place. the staff is very helpful. due to some staff with a handicap things may take a little longer. but is it very good to see these young people do there utmost best to serve the customers. well done all of you. enough choice on the menu. food was good.
"we visited on a weekday evening for dinner. this restaurant is run by people with a slight handicap, aided by professional wait staff. we received a warm welcome and were free to choose a tabl "
staff was friendly and very attentive. food was good and reasonably priced. they have indoor seating with big sliding windows that can open up. the waffle with fresh strawberries and ice was delicious. definitely a good option for dinner!!
"went there for a bowling session with dinner afterwards. anything was done exactly as wished for by the organizers. sometimes the waiters could be a bit more sensitive on empty glasses but all in all.. no complaints. the food was nice, the bowling was nice and all of us enjoyed for a very acceptable price."
"nice terrace, good service, excellent coffee. must get very busy in the season, there was already a good buzz on a cloudy weekday"
"interesting offering: main dish is live cooking (choice of 15 or more meat, fish, seafood and even exotics like ozzie and african beasts and frog legs). sides, soups and salads are all you can eat buffet and dessert is one size fits all. our experience: excellent tastes and varieties, except maybe some choice for desserts would have been better. one of our party however was vegetarian and this should have been prebooked, a good lesson learned. they improvised very well but due to this there was a risk of miscommunications somewhere between kitchen, waiters and guest ‚Äì guest got soup, entree-almost-as-big-as-mains and after that a delicious ravioli as the real main dish! imagine the monthy python sketch about the last after eight, but worth a good laugh‚Ä¶"
a decent restaurant with decent products. dont expect the highest qualities but just good tasting and nice food. the fresh preparation of the meat and fish is good.  the service is exceptional good.
"large selection of dishes, friendly chatty staff. good place to spend a relaxed evening and a full belly!"
"my wife & i had diner in this take away, fast food restaurant that has about 18 covers at table close to the serving counter/cooking area. it has a varied choice of italian and dutch food so there is a lot to read and choose from. my wife choose lamb cutlets and five generous chops were served with salad, 3 sauces and a generous portion of saut√©ed potatoes. i had a rib eye steak with mushroom sauce, saut√©ed pots and salad. good sized portions and well cooked. fine for a hungry couple but ambiance is not for a romantic night out."
"the people are very friendly. the atmosphere is pleasant. the food is excellent. i recommend that you share a portion. the calzone fantasia or the calzone shoarma are very good indeed and more than enough for two people. the choice of beer is ok, but do not ask for an alcohol free beer. there is non "
"good food good prices,friendly service,very helpful the menu in english,,it was clean,we order a hawaiian pizza"
"very pleasant pizza cafe in zwanenburg. excellent friendly service menu also includes english translation. we ordered the soup of the day (onion soup), pizza (no 29) and the house red wine. they brought out some olives, and warm bread, yum. good food, wine and company and enjoyed the passing views. "
good food and reasonably priced.  the service is excellent and there is a decent variety in the menu.
"its in the middle of nowhere, so we didnt have a lot of options, but it was a good experience. the waitress was super friendly, a sweet mother. olives and bread were served beforehand, nice. the pizza was fast and good."
"good food and very friendly and professional personal so if we visit the place  we will eat in the great restaurant normal (relative low) prices for very good diner, also breakfast is fine"
"great location, easy to access with plenty of parki "
"this looks like a really nice place in better weather as the outside patio looked quite enticing. this was an informal business dinner. service was pretty good, couldnt find our server to pay our bill. service was pretty good, couldnt find our server to pay our bill. i had bouillabaisse for the first time. my french colleagues said it was served properly. i enjoyed the mild flavors of the broth. the other two said their dinner was quite enjoyable. this also served as breakfast for the hotel and i found the breakfast buffet extensive and well worth the $11.50 if you like a large breakfast."
usually a perfect place to have a dinner. have experienced this several times before. service and food absolutely grea 
a delicious bagel breakfast and great service. will definitely return when in the shopping centre again and will recommend to others.
stopped here on impulse during a shopping visit to the middenwaard shopping center. the peking duck was a win!
"if you are looking for a real taste of chinese food especially baking duck, here you are. very authentic taste both food and atmosphere. friendly staff and choices of drink. order and take away is also available. try this restaurant and you will definitely love a chinese food."
everything from the get go was a good experience. they had an english menu and rhe waiters where more than eager to help and explain the dishes. if youre not careful you will end up full before your main course so mind the starters....
as a greek living to the netherlands have tried many greek restaurants around. this one has one of the best quality and quantity. gyros which is a traditional meat plate was really good and feta saganaki even better! you have to try it!
"if you are looking for a restaurant, that serves good food and at a great price quality ratio, this is the place. donot expect haute cuisine, but for a pleasant night out befor going to a movie or theater, this is it. staf is young and friendly and is helpfull."
it was the 4th time we went here. servie depends on whos coming to youre table. one is friendly others are sometimes to really good in pushing for drinks. a bit annoying. asking for drinks is ok but not 2 times in a minute.
"de kolonist has put the first steps to fine dining on the map in heerhugowaard. for many years it was hard to find a good restaurant, and there was definitely not enough choice. in recent years this has changed, and de kolonist is definitely in the top 3 of best restaurants he "
good atmosphere. always busy even on a monday so for groups make reservations. bistro card with diverse choice. make sure you ask for vegies when you order a dish..
"i have been here a lot of times and it still is one of my favorite restaurants in the region north holland. the price / quality in this restaurant is good and you can have a tasteful dish for a reasonable price. parking places are in front of the restaurant and near it. the staff is friendly and well mannered. the chefs are open to any special requests on food and with their open kitchen you can take a look at the preparation. i like the atmosphere very much here. for the children there is also a little cinema where they can sit and watch a movie. families are most welcome here! also as a couple you can have a romantic diner. so now and then they have a selection of dishes that are specially priced, that makes it even cheaper to go out and eat a diner. if you are in the neighborhood please stop by this restaurant for lunch or diner. it is worth a try."
the food and the service was excellent. the cook even allowed me to borrow a blanket as we were finished as it started to rain.
"first impressions very positive. cozy and nicely decorated. friendly staff, prompt service. catch of the day was dorado, fresh and simple. beef tenderloin was served on skewers, correctly cooked to temp requested. fries were tasty. the vegetables served as side dish were a bit lackluster, but no other complaints. good value for money."
"we were here for dinner. its a cozy and good restaurant, with very nice and friendly staff. food is very good. wine is also very welltasting. service is great. i would recommand this restaurant to everybody."
"had a great lunch with friends at fleurie. good catching up! the service was very friendly and effective. a nice table was reserved for us. the lunch sandwiches were very tasty and amply decorated with lettuce. the amount was ok, perhaps a bit on the small size. prices very moderate."
"we really enjoyed our dinner at this restaurant. great service - friendly, enticing and efficient - and the food was delicious. we would highly recommend"
"fleurie is quite a pleasant slightly alternative eatery in the main shopping drag of posh bloemendaal. they have a great streetside terrace. around lunchtime it gets busy with representatives of old and new money, mostly ladies of a certain age, gathering for a hearty bite. the food is good though somewhat pricey and the service is friendly, but at a moderate pace. overall a good place to make a stop and enjoy life."
"fleurie is a lovely restaurant in bloemendaal with a wonderful terrace. the food is freshly prepared. i had the salad with goat cheese and the beet soup, served with bread and butter. wonderful gluten free deserts. i had hartendief. they serve coffee and tea. i had the fresh mint tea with ginger. service is friendly. i really love this place!"
"fleurie is an extremely nice restaurant. i was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, nice wines, friendly service and athmosphere. the french chicken was delicious! we had a lovely evening and definitely recommend it."
"they have a great vibe, great food and lovely service. the food is fresh , varied, there is indoor and outdoor seating. we stopped for lunch. it‚Äôs just really good. the decor is appealing too, it‚Äôs cool and hip. village fave and if you‚Äôre passing through a great place to go from as simple as a coffee to a tasty dinner. "
"its at the end of the main street and there is a a little parking terrain. the food last time was delicious and well made. the place is lovely, nice indoor/outdoor seating, easy to wile the time away. this time we just sat for drinks, and its perfect. classy place in a nice little town with good food, drinks and good service."
"delicious fresh made lunch. presenration of the dishes is perfect. sevice is great, friendly. we loved the dessert: vanille icecream, coffie and chocolate."
"i heard good comments about the place, food was delicious & beautifully served with eatable flowers. service also attentions and pleasant."
"when in bloemendaal village (not bloemendaal aan zee) the best place for lunch or a nice cup of bocca cappuccino is fleurie. situated in the town centre near the train station. friendly staff, beautiful menu."
"i have been going with my wife and kids to fleurie for well over 6 years, often multiple times per week. the place has a relaxed atmosphere and the food is generally very good. i have to say the service is excellent too - mostly girls/women who are very welcoming and friendly. its all a bit hippyish - both in style and style of food but the quality never wavers. value for money is superb. "
"very nice lunchroom because they have healthy food, good portions and very friendly service. the atmosphere is also nice."
"i often come here in the morning to have a cappucino. they serve my favourite cappucino.   sometimes i havd lunch here with a nice tuna salad or steak tartare.   in summer, you can use the terrace.   lovely service tooüòò"
"the place for an informal coffee , nice lunch or relaxed dinner, great terrace when nice weather , child friendly, and lots of local delicacies , the place to relax and unwind"
"fleurie is the kind of place where you can go for a coffee/tea with friends or family. but the food is also excellent. lovely homemade quality. if you need a large table do reserve in advance. we had coffee, fresh mint tea and cakes and cookies. service very friendly. its always a pleasure to return. and as soon as the weather is warmer the terrace on the side walk is so nice. while shopping or stopping in bloemendaal, a great place to sit down and relax and enjoy the food and drinks."
"i visited fleurie on a sunday morning with my mother. its a lovely cosy place with a terrace in front. food and drinks are excellent, fresh and wholesome. local juices and produce. fresh bread, cakes , pastries and croissants. the best place for a sunday breakfast, coffee or lunch. well definitely be back. open 7 days a week from 10am-5pm and open for dinner (last call at 9pm) on fridays, saturdays and sundays. on tuesdays: fleurie aan tafel. one dish served for ‚Ç¨12,50. worth the detour if youre in haarlem."
easy going restaurant with pleasant terrace in front. lots of health food. located in the main shopping street of the old village of bloemendaal.
"big portions of pure food, service looks bit clumsy but has its charm and is willing and warm , its a local place where everyone knows each other which makes it look a bit strange for first time visitors, great place for kids"
"together with 7 ladies for a light lunch ,we were all impressed by the friendly staff and the ingredients of the food was superb. we only had entrees and dessert, a  grande desert. the cook outshined himself and we had trouble finishing all the delectables on our plates. it is ,i gather, opened till 5 each day, 7 days of the week and opened for evening meals friday through to and including sundays."
"it was a cold, snowy night when we visited the fleurie but what a wonderful, warm and cosy retreat it w "
the restaurant is beautifully located at the top of the dunes with a view even to the north sea. apart from great dutch pancakes  you can also order some other typical dutch food.
we had a most wonderful dinner the food and wine was excellent and the service was superb definitely will be a regular visitor üëå
"slightly remote from the city but close to nationaal park zuid-kennemerland, very good option for quiet evening... ambiance was great.. staff was very friendly and helpful. limited menu options, food quality was great, portions are good for one. overall very good experience"
"stopped for a short beverage and although there was only a dutch menu, the staff was very nice and helpful. sitting outside was very nice. the street was near but without major noise."
"we went here after a long day of work. the appatized of bread and different butter, pestos is really nice. then the start was really nice i had chateaubraind which was amazing."
"we found this restaurant by chance while cycling in the nearby national park. although not a specialist vegetarian restaurant, we all enjoyed the quorn wrap - lots of fresh vegetables! three portions was more than enough for 2 adults and 2 children, which the waitress was happy to serve. the puddings were good too."
amazing place for chilling out and having great food and drinks . we were there with family last year and wil come back again when we are at the beach.!!
"working in horeca i dont get much time off, especially now. today i was lucky enough for the weather to be beautiful so i went to the bea "
"located perfectly on the beach, the club has a very basic interior that offers plenty of room as a dance venue which is what the evening i attended was. the toilets were kept immaculate despite a very large crowd. only downsides were the lengthy queue to get in and the token system for the bar, both of which cost me a lot of time. "
fabulous beach club in this lovely dutch seaside to 
"walked several miles in the beach and found this place for lunch. great location, comfortable chairs, great service. also good choices, including very good gluten free bread. overall recommendable."
"what an amazing place to spend a sunny day.  good choice of beers on taps, tasty cocktails and a really good vibe."
attended for 3 days in a row for lumi trance festiv 
"great place for a sundowner! drinks, dinner, coffee and chill out place by the beach. stunning view when the sun shines and somewhere you could very easily spend many hours relaxing with friends. will be back for sure. made my first visit to bloemendaal very memorable."
a great venue for a beach party. ive been to luminosity here in 2015 and i will be returning again in 2016 for more!
beachclub fuel was one of the places on my party-bucketlist. and it stood up to the expectations during 2015s luminosity eve

"i admire a restaurant that offers a light version of their entrees. we took advantage of this with their grilled salmon. it was served with full offering of side dishes, just a smaller fillet of salmon. great flavor, good service. when this restaurant is full it can get quite noisy, so sit next to each other if you want to talk. good value and great food. "
i‚Äôve just popped in here for a coffee but after looking through the menu i tried the vegetarian toastie. so glad i did as it was delicious. i‚Äôve read a couple of reviews saying it‚Äôs expensive which i disagree with. you get what you pay for and i‚Äôm happy with the price. the coffee came with a free bottle of water which you don‚Äôt get very ofte 
"we had the burger with fries and a salad. the food was tasty, fresh and i even received additional fries and appelmoes for free... just like that.  very friendly staff as well."
staff is well trained in gluten intolerance and celiac. some of the menu items can be prepared gluten free (dedicated fryer).
we often visit this restaurant on our hiking trips. never disapointed. during weekends and sunny days very crowded. but enough employees to keep it going. be prepared for waiting times.
"although it was very busy, we were serviced quickly, correctly and very friendly! food was great (in our case mussels and pancakes) so we decided to eat there the next day as well! they have a great variety of products, are very willing to adjust your order (e.g. what you would like on your pancake). one of their specialties is bakkums bakkie: coffee with a lot of extras (see photos)!"
"we have dined here a few times with our dutch family and always had great service, and great food in a lovely setting. plenty for kids to do too with colouring at the tables, an adventure playground and a petting zoo."
restaurant with small playground and little animal pen for the kids. nice as a stop before continuing on to beach.  food good but not fantastic. everything fresh. expensive. good selection for children. friendly service.
"this restaurant has a small petting zoo right outside. it is in an area of the dunes with walking trails, and we even saw a few people on horseback. the restaurant is prettily decorated and was nice and warm on a blustery day. we just had tea and hot chocolate, but those around us seemed to be enjoying their lunch. just the spot to warm up before heading back out for a brisk walk!"
"johannas hof is situated in a great spot, close to the dunes of castricum. several walking and cycling trails leave her and you can also rent bicycles. they have a nice large terrace, so if the weather is good there is ample opportunity to sit outside. they also have room for larger groups. we often have coffee or lunch here when we are walking in the dunes. the service can be a bit chaotic when there is a crowd, but the staff is very friendly even if it is busy and you have to wait a little bit long "
"this is an extremely popular busy place, which seems to cope well.  staff are very good and food is a good.  no frills, nice setting in dunes on the way to beach.  play area for kids and goats and birds to look at."
"good food, good service.  large outdoor area, large bike parking, small farm animal area for viewing.  great place to start or stop an outing into the sand dunes."
"after a chilly walk in the surrounding nature (6,6 km) we entered this large restaurant. we asked for apple cake and hot chocolate. the drink was very good. the apple cake was cold and missed the taste we had earlier in other restaurants (like markt 43 and zeezicht in amsterdam or dudok). a slice of strawberry on top of your whipped cream is unnecessary in january. we would have preferred a fresher, lukewarm version of the cake. service on the other hand was quick and friendly. its a professional eating factory."
"cosy, homely decor in spite of this being quite a large establishment. food is traditional dutch fare, served with a smile by very friendly and willing staff. its a great place to have lunch after a walk in the forest and there are plenty of outdoor facilities for children."
"johannas hof is located in a very scenic location, on the edge of de hoep nature reserve, thats well worth visiting in its own right. friendly and fast(for nl) service from the waiters, enjoyable food, great play area for kids, we love it."
"ive been here to a wedding party at night. it is located a bit outside the city, there is enough parking space and there is a small farm outside. the party was nice, well organized with drinks and music. the only negative point was that it was too hot inside, some fans would be ni "
the atmosphere created by the owner makes you feel like coming home. mixing that with nice classic bistro food and one of the wines advised by that same lady makes up for a good evening eating out!
"due to living abroad not been there for quite a few years. it was such a great pleasure to experience once more their pleasant hospitality. some very nice changes have been made to the interior. and the food? very tasteful, lovely presented and very good quality. wish we could visit more often."
"stumbled across this place whilst out cycling, nice place for a light lunch, they do good work with the local community. would definitely go back again"
"we were taken her by our friends, whom we were visiting from australia and very much enjoyed it. the servings where very tasty and plentiful and the staff was very attentive especially towards the kids."
"today this was my second visit to this place. it is not really a caf√© but also not a proper restaurant. the food is all organic and with some sophistication. some people who work here have disabilities and work in a nice, relaxed atmosphe "
wandered around the street and found this for a casual dinner. terrific service from a lady that put up with our lack of dutch language and was able to interpret our australian. we had a really good meal at reasonable cost. note that our australian credit cards and debit cards would not work.

"we found this nice little restaurant. it does have a nice atmosphere. we had a window seat which is a nive place to watch other people. the food was quite good. we had a table of 4 and all the people were enjoying their food. the service was very friendly but a bit slow. it took 2.5 hours for a regular 3 course meal. we had hope for a quick(er) diner. having said that the black angus was very good as were the vegetables. their is a square close by were you can park the car. the restaurant is opened only on friday, saturday and sunday"
"the service was very quick and the food was well above the normal, a friendly waitress looked after us with our food and drink , the restaurant was very airy and had seating inside and outside , the toilets were very clean , thanks again for a memorable meal"
"with a group of 12 (most senior citizens) we had an excellent dinner a la carte; the order were taken efficiently and delivery was fast thanks to efficioent waitresses and wireless contact with the kitchen. after a lunch the previous day - which was very good, we decide to book for dinner the next day. it has been a long time since we had such good food for such a very reasonbale/cheap price, and at the same time an efficient service."
"we went to pesos with a group on nine persons. we had different kinds of tapas for entree. they were delicious and they offerder plenty of them. i could have managed without main course, i was already filled up after tapas. sangria was excellent and there was fresh stawberries in it, nice touch! staff was friendly and they spoke good engli "
been here a couple of times and will come back! the food is really nice for the price and the staff is always friendly! usually book before(just in case) as it can get really bu 
not my first time to this restaurant but this time i was spoiled at my visit from canada here along with some of my family from asten nl. a great place with a mexican touch. again friendly staff and hard working to make sure you are always waited on with your next drink or appetizers. i will return here for sure. the tortilla lasagna was delicious
"we had lunch here today and it was very good. finally an omelette the way it should be. nice coffee, good atmosphere, quick and polite service."
glad to have this restaurant close to where we live. the food is excellent. according to us they should at least have one michelin star (if not two)
"every visit a highlight!  creative food paired with excellent wines. outstanding service, absolutely professional but at all times down to earth and providing a friendly and cosy atmosphere. we had the luck of a nice summer evening being served on the beautiful garden terras. top!"

"very good and prompt service, delicious food. the portions were huge. offered ouzo before and after the meal, as well as the starter from the chef"
generous portions all well prepared foo 
"as a couple with two teens, we were very pleasantly surprised with this little corner of greece in rosmalen, north brabant, netherlands. right after sitting in their cozy dining room, we were greeted with complimentary glasses of ouzo (for the kids, same glasses but with apple juice). then, a complimentary entr√©e (champignons filled with shrimp in a delicious tomato-based sauce) and bead, really delicious. we ordered two other entr√©es (very copious portions, one dish being plenty for 2 or 3 people). wife and kids ordered grilled dishes and they loved them! i ordered the stifado, a beef stew in a rich sauce of small onions, cinnamon, black pepper and clove, with fries and rice as sides... despite being already quite full, i couldnt help but finish it, so succulent it was! my youngest still had a chocolate souffl√© with vanilla ice cream and chantilly cream and i got a nice expresso. we were very impressed with the sympathy and helpfulness of the waiters; all were super friendly, without exception. and then came the owner, who is really a character, super friendly, with whom we still had a good laugh. all in all, a very positive experience, both in gastronomic terms as well as in terms of service. i strongly recommend this nice place to anyone looking for a generous, authentic and delicious meal for a very fair price, including families with kids."
"the buffet allowed for many options, theres about something for everyone, including a good choice set for kids. the wok station allowed you to make your own wok mix which i personally loved. the place was a bit on the crowded side for my taste but that was because of rush hours. i arrived there hungry, and a few hours later i went out with a few extra kilos gained, i just couldnt stop eating. "
"despite the limitations that the restaurants need to adhere to, the atmosphere, service, and food was excellent."
"best all you can eat restaurant ive ever been to! the choice is endless and the food is delicious, exceeds expectations and worth more than what you pay. great service and a wonderful ambiance. i especially loved sitting by the window, the perfect restaurant lighting. i could sit there for hours and i just cannot wait to be back there again!"
ate here with my wife on a friday evening. called ahead 30 min in advance and we were lucky to get a table. place was very busy and lively with all types of peopl 
"very good ayce experience with colleagues, very good variety of food: japanese, dutch, soups, international, teppanyaki. good service, place is nice. price is time based, two hours for 20 eur. excellent."
"great homemade snacks, excellent price/quality and very fast service. even if the place is packed with people (and it regularly is quite literally packed). still you can expect to be served within 15 minutes, no matter how busy it is. and if you want even faster service, phoning in the order, is even faster."
"great service they were very patient with an american like me, friendly people, very clean, good food everything looked great. glad we stopped and i would go back."
"went here after visiting the local archery shop for lunch.  very good food!  burger was very nice, as was the brie tosti."
"the restaurant has got a charming view on the church of diessen, it is located on the sunny side of the road. good service and great wine and beers served."
"this location is an authentic old brabant farm, which serves nice beers, pancakes and other meals . very cosy and excellent, friendly staff."
"always tricky to find a place that is good for young children, parents, grandparents and friends. but this place caters to all. the selection off pancakes will satisfy any child. than they are of to the play area (either in or outside). the ‚Äúgrownups‚Äù sit back and enjoy drinks, bites or an set meal. it‚Äôs all good. the staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is laid back. great fun for all!"
"having been disappointed with closed restaurants in tilburg we opted for lots and we are so happy we did.   cozy interior, great food and the cutest team of waiters ever seen; seriously!   worth many more visits."

"they make the fresh icecream themselves and tastes great! (even better than many gelaterias that i visited on my recent holidays to italy). they have a wide selection of tastes, which they vary on a regular bas "
"swedish restaurant, very authentic and basic. quality is very high and all the typical dishes are available. highly recommended."
we were four americans looking for a swedish experience in a small nice restaurant. our hotel recommended them and it was a short walk away. was delightful and very tasty . helpful and friendly waitstaff
"we visites t zusje with my company., 85 persons. t zusje is a tapas-restaurant with two dishes per round. many choices in appetizers, mains, vegetarian and deserts. personnel was very friendly and quickly in serving."
"we had a very nice evening in a beautiful decoraties place. they serve lot‚Äôs of small dishes so you get to try a lot or repelt when you like it. service was very good, friendly and fast. the only small negative could be that you sit very close to the next table in some places."
"a broad choice of different kind of tapas (not only spanish dishes) and a fast service. make sure you have a reservation, because its always fully booked! looking forward to my next visit!"
"i liked the food very much, i thought it was spanish but no it was all dutch food. my colleague is not so adventurous but he loved very much he even had the dish with paling (eal)  staff was very helpful. recommend this place"

"they way the host, serve and make you feel,,,,family own with a sense of gratitude and great tapas like menu!! ,,,,comfortable rooms upstairs,,,,good breakfast and strong aroma coffee service,,,,,madame mieke does a great job!"
very friendly and good quality tasty food. i only had a main course and a desert. everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. certainly worth visiting.
it was my first visit to this restaurant. i was in the center of bergeijk looking for somewhere nice to eat. my i fell on the italian looking name. it looked clean from the outside with some people eating. so i went in and was surprised by the place. i had only the maincourse because i didnt have much time. i chose the seabass. it was very fresh and tasty. friendly and fast service. fully enjoyed it. will surely visit again.
"we eat here very often as it‚Äôs a lovely local italian, fresh ingredients, simple and not too heavy. the staff are very friendly and super accommodating and will adapt dishes when needed. they even always bring a lovely little amuse bouche! worth a visit!"
"we were there for camping and we went out for dinner due to someones birthday and we are all italian food lover, so we found this one. review says its good and we tried already once, they were fully booked (that is why we knew it should be good as in such small town, food much be good to be fully booked for dinner still!). the food we all had are really good; if you put the reults of michelin star restaurants, this restaurant purely bring you simply good food, simple but good service; nothing else. if you are a good food lover, you would enjoy as much as we do. you must try it if you are in the neighborho "
"it was our fourth visit to this wonderful restaurant and every single visit we have been ecstatic ! i started with a delicious home made bouillon and my husband had coquilles with parma ham. as a main, we both had the saltimbocca. the taste was very italian (having lived in italy we know what that means !) and extremely tasty. we ended with their excellent coffee, although we were very tempted by their desserts, but alas, age is creeping up on as, so we try to watch our calories ! this was all delivered with a natural elegance, attention and kindness in a very pleasant setting, the latter especially now they have added their wonderful (non-smoking) conservatory."
"found ourselves in bergeyk unexpectedly and did a quick check on tripadvisor to find somewhere to eat. pleased we chose buon gusto, it was a really nice location on the edge of a market square. good range on the menu. pasta dishes looked great from what we saw of other peoples. we had veggie lasagna and victoriabaars (nile perch apparently, not something ive ever had before) - both were excellent. nice wine and beer. no kids menu - my daughter only wanted soup anyway so this wasnt a problem. i think they would have done a small portion of a main meal if wed asked. friendly service. only complaint was that we asked for desert at 10pm only to be told that, although they were still serving drinks, the kitchen was closed! would have been nice to know that earlier."
dropped in for an evening meal on a quiet sunday evening. the service was friendly and attentive. the food was delicious and the decor/ambience pleasant. best restaurant in the area by far.
"great dedicated chef, friendly service in a small restaurant on a lovely square in the town centre. i had one of the most delicious chicken dishes. my husband had the rack of lamb which he much appreciated. it was accompanied by a few stir fried (?) veg and a great risotto. their wines are excellent and many of these organic. good fresh coffee ! this was our second visit and obviously we will be back."
we visited for lunch and had a great experience. the decor is very quirky and rustic and the kids loved it. the food was very tasty and not too expensive.....the carpaccio salad and the wild boar were especially recommend

"the food was very good. i had a shoarma pizza that was excellent. the people i was with doner plates and shoarma plates. they really enjoyed theirs as well. the price is a little high, but pretty good for the area."
"situated just off the highway, the self-service restaurant is a good place to stop for lunch. there is a wide selection of freshly prepared food offered at reasonable prices."
"i came in the morning for a quick coffee before my journey to toverland for the day. it wasnt too crowded on a sunday morning. they have different stations where you order your food. i ordered and paid at the coffee station. midway through my order, i realized i forgot to say that i wanted to take my coffee to go. she poured it into a plastic cup. maybe to go cups with insulation and lids arent a regular thing here. on that cold morning, the coffee chilled quickly outsid "
"fresh cooked pizza and burgers (yet she didnt get the cheese burger concept at all).  salads, healthy food, sandwiches etc.  all very fresh and very reasonable.   its beside a kfc so you can throw the kids there for their junk cravings."

this place is extraordinary. it is extremely clean and the food is very high quality. you feel that the cook cares for what he is doing. there are plenty of food and the price is very attractive.  go and try!
"i ate here with my husband, son and our friends with their two childr "
"this restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a warm and welcoming feel about it. the menu was in dutch so i can‚Äôt describe the items but two of us had the spaghetti with the local in season mushrooms, another the vegetarian dish and i the burger, all which were very good. a couple of beers and a glass of red from the (limited) list, and we were on our way. "
"this was a great surprise as we expected usual motorway stops, they were busy but service was excellent the choice of food was good and the price was very reasonable."
"we stay in the close by hotel, it takes only less than 5 minutes to walk to this restaurant. it was very busy saturday evening, after 5 minutes waiting we got the table. the menu was available for english and we ordered the lobster soup, small portion of the grilled beef , the small portion of salmon and the chicken schnitzel. the medium grilled beef was wonderful and my families were also satisfied with their orders. there were also kids menu avaliable. the main course costs around ‚Ç¨15~‚Ç¨23 and the small portion main course we ordered were around ‚Ç¨9~ ‚Ç¨ "

went for evening meal with children and grandchildren. great experience. really good for small children and adults both re food but also service. good value as well. highly recommended.
"initially, prices looked a bit on the high side but the place looks nice. good terras with enough seats and shade. we only had main course and dessert. portions were big enough and the quality was high. so high that we understood and agreed with the slightly higher price. enjoyed the food and will return when in the area !"
i liked everything about the place but not so keen on the people on the  next table (cant have everything)
"we stopped in here driving back from hamburg because it was just off the highway and im glad we did. this was a charming restaurant. although the access road is bit tricky (go behind the petrol station not in front of it) there is plenty of parking. the decor may be a bit kitschy but i thoroughly enjoyed it. they had vegetarian dishes as well, and the portions were very generous. it was a very enjoyable stop. although it is close to the highway, it sits down and off the roads in a very nice open park area."
we are on our 5th day staying at this lovely holiday park. we are so glad we chose this place and already don‚Äôt want to leav 
"we loved our visits to tim. service was friendly and efficient, and drinks menu was extensive. nicest green tea i have ever had! my husband tried the waffle with warm cherries and cream; he scored it 10/10. suitable for kids too."
"super coffee at tim, very friendly and professional staff, very clean surroundings, nice choice of goods, hope to visit again soon."
excellent fresh food with a twist.  lovely interior and exterior and a most interesting little boutique.
what a lovely place for a coffee and a piece of pie. the pie (vlaai) is very regional. it was light and had the perfect amount of topping. we had cappuccino and chocolate latte to drink. presentation was perfect as was the taste. a warm atmosphere and we enjoyed shopping at the store for christmas decorations and chocolate.
good tapas for reasonable price.  in summer time the is a terras.  service is quick and friendly. we eat here every 3 months with family or friends.

"very good service, food environment. the quality of the tapas was very very good.  thats why we are there tonight again with 37 people for my mums 65th birthday."
"especially when its as good as here. holland has lots of asian restaurants due to the colonial past. many are okay. seldom one is bad. some however are very good. like this. my favorites so far: the mihun, babi pangang and garlic chicken."
"located in the city center of tegelen, this chinese restaurant offers a huge selection of asian dishes. the quality of food is really good and the service is excellent."
booked a table for a group. just the nearest oriental restaurant to our hotel. generic chinese interior. extremely nice and efficient server. food very tasty and fast to come. you dont get disappointed.
"the outside of the restaurant is very simple and not very inviting. but you should overcome your hesitations. the restaurant offers excellent meals and rice dishes, chinese, indonesian and cantonese. the staff is very friendly and professional - i.e. is able to take care of the finishing touch at the table of the guest."
old abbey. nice food and nice atmosphere. enjoyed asperges soup. quite a distance from tegelen center but if you combine it with a hiking route it is just a small detour
you are on a hill shaped by the rhine. the lower part you were passing was shaped by the maas river. and you are in between countries where you can taste smell and see the atmosphere of an old monastery
"next to the old monastery ulingshof, where the emmaus foundation resides. wonderful special beers, delicious local foods and an epic housing. nice staff. i love the lamb dish and the naughty goat. visit the thrift store in the monastery too."

"nice and cosy small restaurant. had lunch there, the place was full. they serve different sandwiches, very tasty. service is good. thanks!"
"best restaurant i have been in limburg, burgers are the best! wow! the service is great and very fast. nothing feels rushed."
"finally weve got some time to give the new fancy thematic caf√© in the makado mall a try. we still didnt hear anything about it so weve made our choices in the dark. what a lovely surprise. my husband ordered a kipsat√© that was tasteful and juicy, as he said. my burger was beyond good, was truly the best i ever had. you could taste that it was not the cheap frozen meat what we see everywhere. it was fresh, nicely seasoned, tender, juicy, a party in the mouth. i think what makes the difference at bickels is that everything is fresh made. forget about those makro potted salads on your plate or the traditional fries. everything meal there is properly prepared. way to go, the region missed a quality place like this. youve earned a frequent client!"
"raaaaaah this munch was most devious. some proper italian stallion skran. mandem arrived and the donnys put some meat and bread down before a word was even ushered man felt like royalty. man ordered a beer and it came bare cold like the north pole and dat. these mandem, gyaldem and theydem bare technological and whip out the ipad if u want wine. got man perplexed at the variety of drank. man ordered the pesto ting and the meal was volcanic, bare hot man be careful out here or u will lose a bud or two init. menu lil lacking variety but still got some villainous munch, wallet didnt enjoy it but man did. no paigons in sight either the bossmen, gyaldem and theydem were bless. big up."
"worth going, great authentic food, so not a dutch version of italian dishes. very pleasant spacious indoor tables and large outdoor area. the service was very pleasant, the food yummy, simply a wonderful experience. definitely worth coming back to and deserves to be in the michelin guide!"
"one of the more authentic italian restaurants i have been to in the netherlands (being an italian myself)  great dinner, good quality ingredients, nice and friendly service, nice ambience and well spaced out tables.  would definitely return !"
"an hour away from where we live, but every time its totally worth it. the staff couldnt be better and the chefs skills are simply outstanding. pure top quality ingredients delivering your moneys worth!"
we went already at 18.00pm and only had two hours because of the babysit. they offered us a very nice 3-course dinner and the service was really good. we love to bring a visit in the new accommodation.
"such an enjoyable evening. chic decor, friendly welcome & service. food delicious as always and no rush. if you want a relaxed dinner, time to talk and enjoy good food & wine there‚Äôs no better pla "
"i have been here on multiple occasions and the food and ambiance have always been superb! the pasta is excellent and always fresh, just as the vegetables, which are by the way picked from their own garden! also their secondis (meat/fish plates) are impeckable, same goes for their desserts (you should have the merenque - flawless "
decided to eat here with some friends after reading the review 
"i have really enjoyed our sunday night visit to pasta e vino: the service was impeccable, the hosts very welcoming, prepared and friendly (i was surprised by the knowledge of the waiter about the nonino grappas! actually, i was surprised they even had them there :)  "
fabulous experience. had a super meal in a fantastic atmosphere. friendly service and casual with class and style. loved the laughter og the waitress/owner:-)

"one of the most amazing place ive experienced in my gourmet life! imagine a posh village in limburg, close to a nice church, the most authentic-modern italian restaurant you can imagin "
we had a family meal in this restaurant and staff went out of their way to make the evening a memorable one! the kids food was tailored to their likings and they even got dishes that were not on the menu. advice on wine was excellent as these wines were amongst the nicest weve ever had! will definitely return here!!!
"we are americans living in beek for a couple of years and we kept hearing that we should check out this restaurant. so i booked a table for 10 for my birthday in july and it was fantastic! great italian food, great wine and slightly pricey but totally worth it. there are not too many restaurants i have liked in the nl so this is pretty high praise from me ;). its great for a romantic evening or a special occasion and we had great service (also rare!). we hope to go back! (i wish i would have taken more pictures!)"
we have been visiting pasta e vino frequently for over 20 years . only the fact that we still look out for a next occassion is enough to make it our favorite italian in the southern netherlan

"with the birthday of my mom, i recommend to come here  loved it, good food, nice personal great cook!  i come here already for years with a lot of pleasure! i recommend to ... everyone."
"was invited for the wedding diner and left the building with a big smile. the staff paid attention to the children with a small variety of courses and deserts to choose from without coming up with cliches ( french fries and a snack ). as a guest you were presented with a small card ( a choice of course from the newly weds ) out of which it was hard to choose since everything sounded tempting. my choice, broccoli soup and a fish strudel, was really jummy. should pay a bit more attention to whom ordered what, since being there with children that ask your attention and also paying attention to questions of waitresses, can make it a bit restless. but with children and dessert, it all of a sudden became qui "
"in a relaxed way enjoying a well prepared meal, especially when dining in the glass house, with the grapes growing over your head. bart is a pleasent host and cook and the maids do their best to suit your needs."
"we had a lovely dinner in the small town,  the personal was very friendly. we had a fish salad and a chicken salad both delicious!"
the gouverneur panini was lovely and the kids lunch meals were reasonably priced. the kids that had the cheese and ham toasties said they were tasty. the lady who served us was friendly and helpful. my only gripe was that (after translation) the kids little pancakes should have come with syrup and sugar and came with neither. should have perhaps complained or perhaps google translate wasnt up to scratch!?
"i was in vaals last weekend and had a meal at thessaloniki on saturday. friendly service, pleasant surroundings and a very tasty gyros.the price was right too. recommendable"

"we have been coming to lodge 7 for more than 10 years on and off. today we ate the goulash soup, it was delicious. homemade, tasty and warming on a winters day. keep up the extra lunch specials it‚Äôs nice to be able to choose something different from the regular menu. "
"the best of this restaurant is the location, the view is absolutely great!! however the food is also very good, we were really pleased with our choices and the staff was really friendly and happy to help."
we were here today and it was fine. it was very busy and the service and quality of the french fries is decreasing.  the  ‚Äòkroketten‚Äô were good. we will be here less often.
"nice restaurent at e distance from the bilderberg hotel kasteel vaalsbroek, beatifull view , nice atmosphere in the lodge"
my husband and i come here regularly. the restaurant has a beautiful setting and the view is amazing. the waiters are super kind and make sure you have the best time. the food is amazing. the chef has the ability to give every dish a special flavor! i would recommend this restaurant to everybody that wants a special moment.
magnificent view and where theres served very good coffee. we had a great relaxing time there after a very good walk in the woods. the service is excellent and the people are very friendly. a very good place to sit back and relax
"an excellent place to enjoy the scenery, good coffee with limburger vlaai (try the forest fruit one). its a bit pricey but worth it for the relaxed atmosphere and view."
"this restaurant sits at the base of the wilhelminatoren named after the queen wilhelmina of the netherlands. it offers a view of the valley below. it is near drielandpunt. the area at which three countries, belgium, germany and the netherlands, meet at one point which is also near the highest point in the netherlands, a dizzying 372.5 meters elevation above sea lev "

"lakis is a very nice restaurant. we had the salmon with lemon sauce. well done. the restaurant gave us a complimentary ouzo, very greek, very nice."
i stopped by for a coffee and to warm up on a cold morning while visiting three country point. pleasant traditional decor with efficient service and a good sized coffee served with a small biscuit
"we visited the drielandenpunt and after walking around, we wanted to eat something before getting on the road. all the restaurants were not open, maybe because of the season. im glad this one was the one we chose. i loved the old fashion decor and furniture. our food was superb and we sat in front of the fireplace to break the chill of the rainy day. i high recommend this restaurant if you are visiting either of the attractions surrounding the restaurant."
"the range of guests at this restaurant ranged from friends to hikers to travelers and all are welcome. we stopped in for a bite for lunch and found it quite pleasant. we shared a bar pie while we watched the servers take care of guests at the bar, or the dining room or just the family on the couch by the open fireplace. it was a nice little stop along the way."
"our family spent 5 nights at the kasteel bloemendhal hotel and we were so appalled at the service by the restaurant and staff that we decided to dine in this italian restaurant across the road from the hotel........the dining experience and food was so good we went there twice more.......the owners thea and sjaak are the owners and wilma is the server and each one greets you with a beaming smile and a real sense of friendliness that the restaurant staff in the hotel are somewhat lacking. we have tried three different choices from the menu and each time the food has been superb. each meal is freshly prepared and so tasty and piping hot that you would be hard to find better in italy .....or anywhere else actually. also the price, it is very reasonable too which is an added bonus. but what makes this establishment so good is the warm welcome and attentiveness of the staff........thank you for making our holiday that much better because we really pressed for dining options at the hotel. (a review of our stay at the hotel will be posted on the hotel so "
"we have stayed in vaals 3 nights (hotel incl. 2 dinners) and had dinner here one evening. it was quiet around 21h00 monday evening. we could sit on the terrace. later on the lady asked if we wished another table because there in the corner it was a bit less windy. very kind. food was very good. we had al forno dishes. for me it was very nice but too much. so, you can ask a smaller portion, the owner told me. a nice and good suggestion. i dont if we would return to vaals or neighbourhood, but if we should, we would return to bellissima !"
casual italian with really good food. the people that work there are super friendly. i had the lasagna it was really good and i would come back here again.
"nice restaurant, very clean and light , delicious food , very good service. they have everything on the menu you expect in a pizzeria and a nice choice of wine ."
ate here one evening whilst on holiday and we were really impressed with everything about this restaurant. the pizzas and lasagne were amazing and the staff really friendly. although it was very quiet it has a lovely atmosphere and was decorated really well with beautiful lighting. would definitely recommend a visit.
"this is the chinese restaurant to go to when youre in the neighborhood of renkum. the meals are very good, the buffet every friday, saturday and sunday is more than recommendable and the staff is very friendly and helpful."
"the four of shared a chinese / indian buffet; 23 euro pp for a soup of our choice, a selection of wonderful tasting dishes and a dessert or coffee/tea. very varied flavours, the meat was succulent and moist, good service and very reasonably priced for what we got. highly recommend it; also helped that we had spent the day cycling :-) so we all enjoyed a good appetite on the night."
"despite very average street appeal, we experienced one of the best asian meals ever in this location. exquisite tastes, all super fresh, tasty and not blazing hot. good service and easy location, especially on a bike."
"looking for affordable chinese dining or take out? this is a little hidden gem. go here for really tasty chinese food and excellent service. the ambiance is a little outdated, but for good food, go here!"
mouth watering dinner: mushroom soup was a delight. the spareribs was tender and fell of the bone. and as dessert a creme br√ªl√©e made from blood oranges. . we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent taste and the fine staff!
"the food was good, well cooked, and generous portions. the wine was fine, and the deserts outstanding."
we had the guests menu and we can recommend as a good choice. also a good presentatton of the food. service ok.

"we stopped here for lunch. really nice looking place, clean,good food and service and see that it has rooms as well.if we are back this way ,would consider stay here as well."
"we loved the food and the view on the lake and beach. we were here last year a week on the park and sat a few times at the terrace. some people of the staff were friendly, others less. theres also a beachclub, which is a few meters away on the beach. we liked sitting here, the menucard is smaller than from the restauran "

"while in nearby nunspeet we decided to bike to babble beach for some lunch and a couple of drinks. the bi yale ride is a nice 10 km ride along narrow dutch country roads. we arrived at the beach on the gooi meer and found a table with comfortable seating on their outdoor patio. we ordered a number of appetizers to snack on with our beers. altogether. lovely afternoon. great snacks, pleasant service."

"great spot for a casual dinner out.  the menu is extensive and if you dont see a combination of what you would like, just ask, and they will likely make it for you.  very friendly and quick service.  i would highly recommend this place."
we had lunch here during our bike tour. friendly staf and good service. relaxed atmosfere with a nice terrace.
"reasonably priced dutch and international cuisine with good choice of beers. friendly service. menus available in english and as is the norm in the netherlands, the waitresses all spoke excellent english."
"druten is not on most travellers books. an old market town some 30 kilometers upstream from the old roman city of nijmegen does have some claim to historical fame. its highbrick built steppled roman catholic church stands on the site of the largest pleasure house the romans built when they controlled the western bank of the rhine in the days of yore. this old market town has one of the largest cattle markets in the region. once a year druten is home to what is in english as the last market. a place where people from these lands, that lie between too great western european rivers that flow out to the north sea, speak a polygot of dialects. on the newly paved market square a modern design facade tells you that a restaurant serving greek and other mediterranean crusines to a well travelled rural dutch public. the food is of high quality and echoes the high standard of the several well established schools hotel and restaurant management that can be found in this country. a family group of twelve people coming together to a wake for a much loved person who as an elderly lady had enjoyed the food and service in the past year or two were pleased to find that the excellence of the cook was not diminished when a glass of wine was of pleasing proportions. there was no need to ask if there was anything wrong with the wine waiters elbow as my old mum had once said when her glass looked half empty. for the historian the land between the rivers is where many of the most bloody battles were fought between the dutch and the spanish during the time that spain was spreading its dominions into the calvanist north of europe. there are many old castles and the cycle routes along the banks of the rivers are a delight. but then so is the lovely surprise of a greek restaurant so far away from the mountainous land of myths and where philosophers were found in great abundance. a more to the point the food really tastes good. but then you must find that out for yourself."
friendly service.  great food.  good location.  daily menu is very nice.  ala carte option also.  good selection of drinks.
"as lovers of good food we are so happy for having discovered this restaurant in nijkerk. not only does this restaurant serve a new menu every other week, they do it excellently with a choice of meat, fish or vegatarian, but they do this with friendly service and time for you as a gue "
"we chose the 4 course menu, which was only 27 euro but we were blown off our feet by the quality of the food. portions were spot on ( given the 4 courses ), seasoning and textures simply amazing. the staff also had some excellent wine suggestions, even though they werent trained for it. we can highly recommend it."
pleasant experience. four people took the 4-course dinner that is very reasonably priced. one of us had it gluten free and was pleased to find that extra measures were taken to make sure the meal was equally satisfying. well definitely go back.
"pleasant service, nice food with a good and well prepared. interesting setting in the industrial area, but do not let that scare you away :). best value for money i have had for a very long time."
"the location of this restaurant is not the most favourable, although situated along the river. a bit of the beaten track, it does a good job of attracting customers. the ambiance is nice, the service friendly and knowledgable and the food is inventive and very tasty. they will accomodate almost any dish to your allergies and still make it taste wonderful."

"we had a superb dinner at salentein bistro: cosy atmosphere, nice table, very friendly waitress, constructive chat with the chef who is working in the open kitchen in the center of the bistro. the entrecote was excellent and big. together with a bottle of salentein malbec dinner at this bistro was a real experience."
"please note, my notes and review concern the restaurant part, theres also the so-called bodega part and i am less happy about that part, so i always reserve at the restaurant part. variety of the menu is great and changes every now and then, also seasonally influenced. both fish and meats are good, just go here and experience it for yourself."

"without wishing to be rude to nijkerk, the phrase middle of nowhere might have been made for it, so how good to be taken to this restaurant for fine wine and good food. i would heartily recommend any of the beef dishes featuring meat from the salentein estates either here or in argentina. a real treat."
"one of the culinary attractions of the veluwe region is restaurant de salentein on the centuries old estate of the same name. it is spacious and is tastefully decorated, whereas the service is good. a remarkable feature is that de salentein owns vineyards and cattle in argentina, salentein wines and beef are, therefore, on the menu. our guests were vegetarians but that was no problem, the cook prepared tasty food specially for them. we ourselves chose roasted pheasant. all of us enjoyed the salentein sauvignon blanc."
"i had lunch here in december.  the restaurant is in a really nice location, with beautiful countryside around it. the food was top quality, with good combinations of flavours and the service was attentive."
"in town on business and encouraged by other ta reports, i decided to step away from the limited, rather typically overpriced bar menu and took a 15 minute stroll to this establishme "
"our hotel advised us that portillo bar bodega (connected to de salentein) was one of the best restaurants in the vicinity and they were correct! its quite a beautiful place, surrounded by green fields. we were welcomed warmly by the hostess and seated next to the open kitchen, where we could see everything the cooks were doing. the waiter kindly explained about the concept of the (fresh off the land) meats they served. the service and the food was impeccable. the olive oil was so good, we bought a large bottle to take home with us. we will definitely return when in the neighborhood!"
it was a warm and sunny day so we could enjoy the well situated terrace. because it was weekend the huge outside grill was fired up so the suggestion was easy: meat! i had the entrecote together with a delicious malbec. simply the best i ever h

"been there about 5 times already and will definitely come back, the grill restaurant that is, never been to the other place. the grill restaurant has excellent steak and the ribeye is highly recommended, starters and deserts also very good!"
"had a 4-5 hour lunch, of several courses with 4 other friends out on the terrace. the food was varied and excellent, the service perfect, selection of wines from their own wineries gorgeous. the ambiance added to one of the best dining experiences i have had....well worth the visit."
"whilst enjoying a drink in the lobby, the staff informed us that a prominent dutch car importer, traveling the world, got stuck in panama and ultimately arrived in argentina where he laid the basis for a farm raising cattle and growing wine. the lovely little castle just northeast from nijkerk has hosted the car importers headquarters, but now is home to a restaurant-cum-grillroom. evidently, the beef and wines of the argentinian farm are featured on the menu list. we visited the restaurant - very pleasant, highly attentive service and excellent food. of course, it comes at a price. those with a smaller budget should have dinner at the grillroom, which we didnt visit this time - but certainly will do so shortly!,"

"think quality not quantity. we ate on the √° la carte restaurant. for the larger eaters go ahead and order extra side of potatoes. food was super!! with our drinks we were given olives and veggie chips. after ordering, bread tomato tampenade arrived. food arrived and was delicious!! bit of veggies, nice celery with apple salad and a small portion of fries. again, larger eaters ask for large fries or get the extra potatoes... both super delicious! come here when you want to be pampered but not broke, prices are reasonable for the ambiance / location. "
"erve kots not only offers a traditional pancake restaurant but recently opened a unique alacarte restaurant called hoofdkwartier van de prins. food is prepared using a so-called josper oven (a charcoal oven). that, and the use of predominantly locally sourced products, resulted in an unforgettable culinary experienc "
gorgeous location along a waterway overlooking a small bridg 
we have visited this restaurant  numerous times over the past several years. the food is always excellent especially the rhubarb sauce. the owners are delightful to talk to and go out of their way to help us with our limited nederlands vocabulary
"very friendly staff, very nice view on the lake! too bad the weather wasnt cooperating. not too many dishes on the menu, but the quality was excellent! we (2 persons) had dinner for under 50 euros."
"beautiful view over the water. we had fried egg with bacon, cheese and ham. a tasty filling meal with great value. a coffee to end the meal was what you could always expect."
food was good although rare steak was medium. very good value for money and lovely outlook from the terrace.
the most important feature of dald wal is certainly its locatio 
"we bad lunch alt this place. the service was very friendly and ohr food was great. sitting right at the water outside enjoying the sun and watching the boats coming in and out, very very nice"
"the menu is nog very big but everything is good! i chose for a vegetarian quiche, this was excellent. my husband has meat and this was also from the best quali "
"came here on a recommendation after a day of sailing and was unexpectedly served a very respectable smoked salmon tartar with lemon mayonnaise and some diced, marinated cucumber. the burger was also pretty decent. we were seated waterside on a canal lined with old wooden boats (and a couple of dinghies) and the service was quick and friendly - despite the evening rush."
very handsome converted mansion in the middle of beetsterzwa 
"we had great experience with fantastic service by our server,  we let the chef decide which steak to choose which he did....what we got terrific made for perfection with fantastic side dishes."
had a very simple lunch in this quaint little town. was on a monday when most stores were closed. so go later in the week. most are also closed on tuesdays. menu is simple. very good mushroom soup and sandwich.
"nice environment, good food and friendly staff. although there are a lot of high quality hotels and restaurants in beetsterzwaag, we recommend this place."
"we were there on a lazy sunday afternoon,in august, rather quiet. nice menu, and our choice was enjoyable. the personal however, looked a little bit bored. that is a pity, and a loss, because after all: we are paying guests!!"
"located in a pretty suburban town, the restaurant offers quality, tasty local cuisine in a nicely decorated dining room that is at once touched by elegance yet far from stuffy. they also offer a nice variety of cocktails and the wine list is compact but will appeal to all palates at reasonable prices. the service is friendly and efficient and this is great place to while away a couple of hours over aperitifs, dinner, wine and perhaps a dijestif. highly recommended. expect to pay about 40-45 euros per person for a 3 course meal without drinks."
"outstanding service, facilities, food quality/variety and cleanliness. excellent value for the money. was above expectations."
"second time to eat dinner at voorhuys restaurant emmeloord. service is excellent, food is amazing and the place is well and neat. we ate outside the first time and the second time we ate inside. we were attended well (by tim) and we did enjoyed the visit. a must dinner location most specially to those who want an excellent atmosphere in the middle of a city center."
fabulous fish and meat followed by a dame blanc.  coffee .  we also had in the afternoon a latte lovely
"emmeloord is not usually a place that one would find themselves on purpose, i suppose, but this place is something else. great kitchen, great drinks, outstanding and very enthousiatic staff. clean, roomy, and comfortable rooms, excellent shower "
"this local favourite will fill up with finely dressed dutch men and women enjoying all the restuarant has to offer, any evening of the week! a grand cafe experience of the highest quality. they can back it up with awards! enjoy lunch, dinner, drinks, or dessert in a warm, and relaxed setting. as the dutch say gezelli "
"eating lunch, diner its always pleasure. the food is superb, service is qualified and the price is reasonable. and sitting on the bottom of the sea makes it spectacular"
"really nice and cozy place in the nature: golf fields and lake, beach ideal for the children especially if the weather is nice. personal friendly and food tasty. really good location for party with family and childr "
"after a walk around the ring of castelijnseplas, it was a perfect stop for a drink or a meal. staffs are responsive, food is good and the price is surprisingly affordable."
"lunch was nice. nice concept with choosing multiple smaller dishes. nice food, friendly service, reasonable prices."
"varied and really delicious food and drinks, amazing and relaxing environment both indoor and outdoor on the beach, staff very nice! try the apple cake or the carrot cake."
we didn‚Äôt eat here but called in twice for drinks. first we listened to some excellent live music. we had already booked at an italian restaurant but called in again afterwards. the owner or manager made time to chat to us and if we had been in town longer we would have definitely eaten there. 
this place is smack in the center of emmeloord at the cinema and theatre corner. there are plenty of tables and chairs if to sit down outside if the weathers nice.
"this restaurants location is right at the corner. good spot. we were there for drinks and snack. reasonable price and food was okay. cozy atmosphere. there are plenty of outdoor seats, also indoor."
"very nice place for a snack , dinner and a drink, smack in the middle of emmeloord, you can sit here for hours and enjoy. as it can be windy on even the nicest summer day in the lange nering emmeloord you have to adjust to this fact and maybe sit inside, although sitting outside is more enjoyable, i recommend a glass of wine and some kind of share plate, love it."
"nice tapas restaurant, delicious food. they also have a nice combo (option) with the movies, which is right next to it."
"stopping at this nondescript restaurant in emmeloord for lunch one weekday in september was totally fortuitous. my group was on its way into the netherlands countryside from amsterdam. we pulled into town, parked in a large, crowded parking lot and began walking to where we understood a number of potential lunch spots were located. eindeloos certainly appeared plain from the outside, but since we were basically looking for sandwiches, it seemed ok, particularly because it was about the first place we came across. the interior is nothing special either, with the appearance of a recently closed nightclub re-worked into a restaurant. once we saw the menu, we began to get the picture this was something different. the food itself was totally eye-opening. soup of the day was pumpkin and crab and it was delicious, clearly using fresh ingredients. our wraps and sandwiches were also fresh and extremely good; the wraps and bread were fresh, as were the cut fruit and potatoes. even the tzatziki sauce that accompanied my gyro was homemade with fresh cucumbers. we were really surprised expecting basically a cafeteria and receiving really fresh and a well-made meals. the staff was pleasant and, admittedly, were somewhat challenged by some of our questions in english, but service was great, and everything was served just right. i had to stop and ask for a card from the staff before leaving to ensure i remembered the chef/owner, john van beek, and restaurant. the restaurant also had beer on tap and a bar; it appears to be a nice place for dinner as well, especially with the attention to details and daily specials with fresh ingredients. really a nice restaurant."
"enough choice, very wide range off products, all fresh  qaulity , all you can eat is so trough. recommend every body for having a good qaulity time at plaza a 6"
we had a family gathering and chose to have it at plaza 6. perfect for our group of 10 since they have an array of cuisine. they have food choices for gluten free and dairy free too! staffs are efficient and they are always ready to clear your table after a batch. they have a 2hours minimun for dining. it was a nice experience.
"couldnt thank the people at plaza 6 enough, i went with my boyfriend at the beginning of december and i was not disappointed! so much amazing quality food, wide choice of delicious desserts friendly staff and the stirfy chefs were so talented! will definitely be going back next time im in the netherlands! "
very friendly staff and fast service. great and tasty food at a correct price.  at a rather strange and hidden  location.
"it took us a while to find grieks, tucked away in emmeloord, but it was well worth the navigational challenge. our greeting was especially cordial both from the head waitress and the affable owner. immediately you step through the door after scaling the steep staircase and receive the authentically generous welcome, the delightful live greek music whisks you into mood for greek foo "
after we saw so many good comments we decided to join the #1s restaurant of emmeloord and to be honest we hadnt been disappointe 
"we loved our dinner at this greek restaurant. a hidden gem in a side street of the busy shopping street. the street is even called achterom, which translates into a street around the back. the staff was super friendly and put a smile on our faces and yummy food in our bellies. would revisit! the upstairs part does not require a lot of effort. there is an elevator if you dont wish to go on the (steep!) stairs."
"rodon brings the greek sun, hospitality and taste to emmeloord and are true to upscale casual dining."
"my friend invited me to go here for dinner. both of us order pasta, which are really good. we come here year ago, we feel it is maybe the best italian  restaurant here."
"beautiful old railway station rebuild in a beautiful restaurant. friendly staff, very good food, really a pleasant time to be!"
"super staff working here, they are so dedicated for making sure  guests love staying here. awesome starter, flammkuche and than the red fish, cooked to perfection. served with fried califlower and green beans. woow, just lovely."
"had lunch here with the family and i can say the food is of excellent quality. staff is very friendly and accurate. they have a selection of beers, we definitely go back soon."
"great welcome, superb accommodation and facilities. modern and very clean. excellent wifi. on site parking. on the edge of a cute little village near amsterdam, and near a rail station. the only downside was that the breakfast offerings were a bit meager for the price charged."
i‚Äôve stayed here a few time on business. it‚Äôs a small hotel in a lovely quiet location. staff are always accommodating and friendly. food is tasty.  rooms are large and bed is super comfortable.
"i stayed in hotel de witte dame one night (for business). the hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. the rooms are very nicely decorated, silent and luxurious in a good w "
"but you leave with the worst impression because of the breakfast and the service....the ambience, the dinner, the rooms and the friendly reception staff promise a great stay. but wanting to leave early in the morning is a nightmare. breakfast starts at 8am, and even if you are in the breakfast room with your luggage packed and in a hurry to catch your plane, begging the waitress to at least get a coffee, you are left alone, without coffee or even water. repeating the wish for coffee at 8.02am, so in the official breakfast serving time, doesnt help. still no breakfast or coffee, but the explanation that she is alone and her colleague didnt show up. no apologies, no coffee, no nothing, just half an hour wait in an empty breakfast room, and no attempt whatsoever from the service to help with a croissant or a yoghurt. thank god they have coffee at schiphol. what a shame that we had to leave this wonderful place with anger and emptiness in our stomach just because of incompetent service!"
"super friendly staff, quick preparation, and yummy toppings.  they do delivery, takeaway, and (as we did) shared tables or window seats.  reasonable prices as well."
"we visited this restaurant twice within a stay of 3 days for dinner. the pizza is really nice and it almost feels like you‚Äôre in italy. the portions are big ! also, the place offers ice cream, which is really nice for a refreshments."
"certainly on a sunday night, this place was doing most of its business by telephone/delivery, but has a several eat-in tables right by the window overlooking the canal. the food was simple but plentiful and very tasty - and very reasonably priced. its nothing fancy but definitely a very pleasant place to eat in a nice location."
"great pizza take away, especially like bari, pesto en vulcano. rather quick delivery and still warm,"
best pizza in abcoude. not many places to eat in so its best to take out. its always busy there so better call in advance. they also deliver in the neighborhood.
"this is one i specifically asked tripadvisor to add, as it was an impressive enough meal to make note of. youll find porta e porta less than one block from the church in the main town square, and its pizza, salads, and even its desserts are worth tasting. excellent choice for inexpensive, good italian (at least dutch-style italian)."
"nice, cozy, freindly chinese restaurant with friendly staff and enough choise on the menu card to have a good time!"
"very cosy restaurant, super nice staff and lots of flowers. amazing great chinese food. fried dumplings, woow just lovely. pekingsuck with crispy skin is unbeatable. top quality of everything."
"the service was the best i got in all amsterdam , abcoude and areas they were just perfect and the food was delicious i recommended 100%.  good job!!‚ù§"
"perfect food, very pleasant staff! modern and convenient interior, tables and chairs. easy to find, next to the old church, in the center of the town."
"i visit here at least once a year when i am in the netherlands as the food is gorgeous, never been disappointed, the staff look after you so well and are friendly and helpful. this visit i had the beef strips with sesame and it was delicious. i will be back again for sure. abcoude is a beautiful town and you can watch the canal bridge being raised whilst sitting enjoying your meal."
this restaurant has a good name and i know people who go to this place from amsterdam for the food! its very centrally located. the staff is very very friendly! they also offer take out food. food has good flavors. we didnt had to wait too long for our food. we arrived a bit too late and were still eating when its was about closing time but the staff never gave you the feeling that you had to leave. our food was very good but it was too much. we couldnt finish it all which was bad as it was very good!
"i was delighted by all aspects of my dinner. although alone i had no difficulty booking a table on a very popular night. the staff who served me were invariably polite, spoke good english and were not phased by my requirement for gluten free food. the food was tasty and hot. the main course of duck stir fry was kept over a candle, so piping hot all through. there was no pressure to leave which sometimes happens when you are alone. all in all, a reasonably priced good meal."
"my town. very friendly, clean, great taste, if possible: no ve-tsin, no problem. when i go for take away i can eat two times."
modern chinese restaurant with real good flavors. i travel to china and hong kong 8 months a year and enjoy authentic foods. but this place has a great modern twist on some real basic staple foods in chi 
"the team always make you feel like customers in the truest sense of the word. the food is well prepared and tasty. you can get take away food, but better even is to treat yourself  and"

"always try to visit the jasmijn every time i am in abcoude, it is my favorite restuarant in the town. the food is always top quality and ample portions. i had the sizzling steak but had a peanut sauce instead of the spicy one and finished off with a damme blanche and it was gorgeous. i will be back again next time in town."
"jasmyn is run be an owner who is from hong kong. the food they cook is great, the rijst tafel which is indonesian was great served with the dishes i expected. the satee tasted great, my wife who is from china enjoyed their food. overall nothing bad to say, the service was great and it offer some of the best asian food in the amsterdam are "
"try to visit here with my friend from abcoude once a year when i am in town, the service is excellent really friendly and helpful staff and most importantly the food is always excellent cooked to perfection. i nice atmosphere and in the summer you can sit outside as we did and watch the world go by in abcoude whilst enjoying your meal. well worth a visit."
instead of all the old fashioned chinese restaurants this one was redecorated a couple of years ago which attributes to a nice atmosphere. the food is nice (especially their specialties) and the people kind. make sure you make reservations for the weekend because its always crowded
having been a frequent visitor to hillegom for the last 26 years i finally decided to try to the food in this hotel. it was a good decision. the food was very good and the staff were polite and friendly. it provided a lovely atmosphere in which to dine with friends.
"i celebrated my 40 birthday here. was very well organized, enough beer, even cold. the food was excellent and enough. coming back for the next party!"
"hotel is handy located on a street with many shops and restaurants. our room was big and there were all neccessary facilities, nothing special though. breakfast was really good, allthough after nine some things were already eaten."
hotel is warm and inviting. makes you feel at home. wonderful restaurant and bar. mingle with the locals. they are friendly and give great advise as to were to go and what to s 
"great location, between zandvoort and noordwijk. hotel personal is very friendly. we stayed in a room at the second floor, in august, very very hot, no airco. no tea or coffee possibilities in the room.  diner is good."
"had lunch, and the food was great, and the location and staff were super nice. i love goat cheese salad, and the one they make is one of the best i ever had.  french fries are great, too."
this is without doubt the best place to dine in hillegom. the menu is superb and varied and the staff friendly and welcoming. special mention to elsa who makes wonderful irish coffees. so good in fact that more than one was consumed. highly recommend for an all round pleasant experience.
"dined here again on two occasions this week and both times the experience was superb. lovely food, very friendly and helpful staff and a lovely atmosphere. special thanks to the member of staff who looked after my glasses when i left them behind by mistake. i collected them the next morning along with a personal note. very happy customer. they also make great irish coffees."
"dined here recently for the first time and will definitely go back when im next in hillegom.  friendly staff, great food and sumptuous decor all added up to a very pleasant dinning experience."
"i visited late at night with my husband and although the kitchen had just closed they still let us order. we ate a full three courses and we were made to feel very welcome given the time of night it was. the food was very tasty and presented very well. should i return to the area i would definitely return, hopefully a little earlier :) "
"great food, style and service. those young people give it all and what they don`t know yet they learn fast. enjoyable kitchen and venue, terrazza, blazing fire inside and nice corners on the 1. floor."
"went there after a long bike ride in the tulip fields. had excellent food - and they had nice local beers and my favourite trappist brand. fast, genuine service."
pleasant surprise. food and presentation were very well done. had the prime rib with wine sauce..highly recommend place and dish. a little pricey but well worth it. staff courteous and tried very hard to make it a good experience
great dishes and great people who work there - i enjoyed it very much ^^ everything was fresh and tasty - nice decor and music ;)
"we had an excellent dinner at this place, food was great, but service and attention from waiters does need improvement. had to ask for refill on drinks, clearing the table after a course was done, and so on. pity. but again, food is great and ambiance also!! a place to go back to!!"
we both had the sate. it was exactly as a good sate should be ! will definitely go back to try the other dishes.
"after a long day we were looking for pub grub but were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food at het alternatif, all perfectly cooked and presented, comfort food with a difference. also great attentive service. well worth a visit."
"due to the different levels it might be a challenge to dine here with big groups but with a small group it is perfect. good food, good wine."
i went here with friends for diner. we all had a menu and all three courses were deliciou 
"this place was recommended by a friend, so we had dinner here the other night. it is in the centre of hillegom and there is parking behind. we went on a nice summer evening and the terrace was well occupied, but we decided to eat inside as you are allowed to smoke outside in the netherlands! the menu is not very large but it has good choices! all our meals were excellent and nicely presented. the staff was very friendly and efficient! "
"we stumbled upon this restaurant on a trip in early may and had a great lunch.  we liked it so much, we returned for dinner later in the week when we were nearby.  it was another delicious meal.  service was excellent, as well."
"during our weekday dinner time visit to the restaurant the place was packed, so they must be doing something right. both the food and atmosphere were great and the service professional and quick. recommended if you‚Äôre in the hillegom area."

we visited this restaurant with about 20 people. the groupe was well seperated from the rest of the restaurant. the fact that are three different levels in this place makes it all very cosy. on top of this the food was nice and the service very friendly.

"it is a very nice restaurant in center hillegom. food is absolutely delicious, served in a french way.   minuses: - menu is not available in english - toilets were dirty"

we went to seray for a family dinner with my parents and my in-laws. tante ellie menu to share is delicious. the staff and the owner were friendly and very helpful. really appreciated the efforts made to accommodate my mother in law. a fantastic experience and a very special evening. thank you üòÅ
this is a lovely place to celebrate something with friends or family. it is a more modern and personalised version which really is following to the tradition. modern atmosphere with lovely staff. it can be busy so booking is required most days of the week.
just had a wonderful rijstaffel (set menu) at seray. amazing food and lovely to see such a nice family restaurant doing well in a world of boring chains and franchise 
"this is a little gem . after hearing a lot of good things about seray we decided to have a go. we were not dissapointed , the food and service is exellent . after a while i began looking for faults (thats me} but could not find anything . clean- cozy- geat price - briljant team , my wife was given a tour of the kitchen by ray the owner , she said it was spotless . and the flnally the bill schocked me as a was very small (and i am scotti "
"we went there again with the family to experience the seray treatment again. we were there before and had a splendit evening in this tiny little cosy restaurant. we were welcomed very amicamidly and stated accordingly. then the matter of teh house came to our table to explain the menu and to recommend the wiens for that evening. then the warm bath started. one delicious dish after the other arrived at our dish, and it kept on going. a real delicious evening treat. very recommendable."
"after a fully enjoyable and colourful visit at keukenhofs tulip wonderland, we were starving for some authentic indonesian food. enter seray bistroriental:-) we followed the reviews of fellow travellers and foodies and we were not disappointed...we went in soon after opening with the staff (eating their early dinner to prepare for the evening) warmly welcoming us. the head chef and owner, raymond, brought the menus and explained a bit the history and philosophy of the restaurant. we ordered one of the restaurant specialties but we werent prepared for that: an extensive culinary trip to indonesias best...three hours later (yes, three hours later but hey a greek and a spaniard can talk...) we left thinking this was a restaurant worth writing home about! thank you to the chef and team! pity the nearby vintage ford museum is now closed...but hopefully see you next year after keukenhof!"
"the service was very personal, in time and friendly. the temperature of the red merlot was a bit too cold. the food was excellent and we will surely repeat the visit. the only minor thing was the cooking smell on our clothes, when leaving the restaurant. the air suction was not functioning correctly."
everytime i come to holland it is becoming a family tradition to visit seray.  the food and service is excellent and well worth the trip.    ton kiphardt
we love the rijsttafel dishes. this restaurant is nice with great food. staff super nice. the interior is very nice. many dishes especially sate was very tasty.
"the meal was excellent; the drinks served on the right temperature, the service in time and very friendly."
"we went here for the second time, and again we were surprised by the good food and service. this on top of our favourite restaurants. the experience of the food was again mouth watering."
we enjoyed our meal at seray bistro. we bought the full meals and they did not disappoint. it felt like we were able to sample dozens of items off the menu which turned out to be an amazing meal! we loved it! service was fast and friendly. i appreciated the waitress taking our coats and ensuring she greeted us as we left. the food was so good and it felt healthy. nothing fried or over done. nicely seasoned and wonderful tasting! i love it all!
we were with 5 guests and all of us enjoyed the food. four of us has the tante elly rice table and one had the nasi ramas. lovely and very tasteful. will definitely be back.
"you have to really look for the restaurant otherwise you wont be able find it. once you do find it, you know youre in for a treat. i ordered the nasi goreng along with 4 other small dishes (2 meat + 2 veggies). its a lot for 1 person so come hungry. the dishes were well prepared and tasty. the service is great as well. id definitely come again."
we were at seray with a group of 4 adults and 2 children. we had several different dishes and they were all very good and tasty. even the kids liked it. we got lots of extras so there was plenty of food! the young lady that served was very friendly even though she was on her own and very bus

"i was told this restaurant in the little village of hillegom was a household name for the devotees of the indonesian cuisine. personally, ive found most of the indonesian food so-so; too often way too salty and too often showered with flavour enhancer "
"i love indonesian food and am quite experienced, both cooking and eating. i checked tripadvisor for a restaurant near haarlem and this one popped up. book a table and had their rice tabl "
it is located in the old hillegom post office. cute place. good for families. the service is friendly and the pancakes are good. at times they have groups. we had the traditional dutch pancakes (cheese and bacon) as a test. all good !!
"we were biking from haarlem to lisse on our first vacation to holland, and stopped here for a quick lunch and break from all the pedaling. what a delight! veis was very patient with us (we are typical americans so our dutch was basically non-existent). she recommended her favorite pancakes and a fantastic local beer which was refreshing and totally perked us up for the rest of our day! we rested, enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, savored the food, and to top it all off, my husband collects glasses, so when he asked to purchase one of the specialty beer glasses for the blauwe tram triple we enjoyed, the manager gifted us a one! o.o truly generous and far more than our relatively inexpensive meal warranted. the hospitality was the highlight of our day, and helped make our whole trip magical. this was by far the nicest stop we made and well happily trek across the globe to come back some day!"
we go here for coffee and lunch. in the summer you can sit outside. the staff is friendly and the place it well suited for kids 
"this is a lovely little kid friendly restaurant. all of our food was fabulously made, fresh and delicious. we were very happy with our dutch pancakes but also the cheeses and salads. the were terrific with our children, too. its located in a cute little town! highly recommend!"
"great ice cream. very busy place in the weekends, but more than enough staff to make the line go fast. do visit if you get the chance!"
"out favoriete icecream parkour. always about 30 different flavours. good and tastefull icecream, freshly made each day and at very reasonable prices."
".... even if you are spoiled by true italian icecream this spot is worthwhile visiting. and their motto is true, never take only one scoop. today it was tiramisu amongst others. great !"
"no doubt that this place knows how to make the best ice cream and frequently updates its assortment with great new tastes. seating becomes a bit problematic on top dates given the amount of traffic. (outside waiting lines are not unusual). there is, however, more than enough qualified staff thus the waiting never becomes unpalatable."
"since many years the place t go for very nice ice cream. with alway super quality. also for a very reasonable price! take care many times there is a waiting line, because it is well known"
definitely best ice place in the area. always friendly staff. good quality product. never been disappointed.
"i used to go to de hoop when i was a child, 30 years ago. they still exist and are still delicious ! they have earned several prices and they deserve it. a must to try in blaricum!"
"best ice cream weve had in years, with an incredible range of flavours. despite a long queue, the weather was very good that evening, the staff move fast and are friendly and accomodating."
"this is the best ice cream in netherlands, perhaps the world. yes, there is gelati in italy, but that is a different set of ingredients (mainly ice and milk and natural non-artificial flavours. dutch ice cream is pure raw milk made with flavours. in most places you get artificial flavours and low quality milk. the price can run from euros 3-5 for one or two scoops. at de hoop, you can savour the flavours while standing in line for ten-fifteen minutes and build up an appetite. when you finally get insie, five cheerful young dutch school children (and occasionally the owners) serve you with the speed of a new york city fast food chef. you pile away a kilo of ice cream for euros 8.50 or individual cones with one or two scoops for just euro 1.50 or 2.5 for two. thats half price to the garbage they serve in most ice cream salons worldwide. only the moonlight inn at victoria beach, manitoba on lake winnipeg in canada can beat that. supplied with dutch quality ice cream, the line ups can be longer on a warm sunny day, but the cost and quality are unbeatable."
"in the middle of blaricum is this amazingly nice ice-cream shop. made by the owner herself, fresh, great taste and against reasonable prices. even if it rains worthwhile the visit."
"this small but cosy place used to be a milk factory, but now it is a ijssalon, where you may sit down to have a real treat in a coupe, with cream and chocolate, or go to have a hand treat ijsje. you may sit down at a small table, choose a spoon to handle the ice-cream, or eat it out of a cup or beker. they close down for the winter."
if you like ice cream this is the place to get a cone! all home made ice creams absolutely the best! friendly prices as well worth the wait!
at this iceparlor you will be able to get a very high quality of icecream giving you the idea of visiting a parlor in rome. perfect flavours combined with high service. personal takes extra care if they hear a request that might indicate an intollarance or allergy (and they actually do know the difference between the two). also the ratio between price and quality is very good.
"the variety of icecreams is crazy. its fresh and a lot of choice. ive been there ¬± 50+ times, but i recently went somewhere else and that made me aware that im spoiled with the quality. its even fun and nice to be in a queue. friendly staff and great ice"
during years over years this salon has the best icecream of holland. winners of several prices! go over there is a must and enjoy
"nice ice cream store, good service, nice selection of flavors. a bit cheaper than in rotterdam. worth visiting"
"it is not a restaurant, but an icecream sh "
one of the place to get good quality ice-cream.texture of the ice- cream is nice and creamy and full of flavour. lots of flavours to choose from and price wise is good.
"great place to eat, drink and relax. perfect for a little getaway with kids, they can enjoy in and out playing."
it is a very nice and cosy place. it is also great that there is indoor and outdoor play area for all ages of kids. food is also good. you can enjoy you day with your friends while your kids are playing ;)
"indoor and outdoor fun for childeren. a perfect lunch menu, a not unexperienced staff but not disturbing."
perfect for a visit with (small)  children. very nice play area inside and outside.  simple but honest lunch dishes. we will definitely return.
"tasty food, excellent service. better than the last time we were here, for sure. make sure you book at table, especially when the suns shining, because its really busy!"
great place and location with unique view on the moorland and forest. next to the sheeps ‚Äúhome‚Äù. good parking
"lovely location, great venue and delicious food!  very friendly staff who fulfilled all our wishes. very nice if you have a bigger group coming. i would recommend it for sure!"
another beautiful summer day in netherlands and sitting outside for a drink and de tafelberg is a great place. enjoy the sun! service could be better...
one of our favorite spots is this restaurant with large outside terrace ‚òÄÔ∏è next to the blaricumse heath (in summer time you will sheep everywhere  
was introduced by friends to this lively little place. good parking facilities and a fantastic welcome. plenty of staff and great menu choice. overall very good service and the quality of the food is amazing. pricing maybe for some people slightly above average but i think it‚Äôs definitely worth i 
"pleasant restaurant on the moorland. good-sized terrace. food was decent, but nothing outstanding. reasonable prices for this part of the netherlands. service was a little slow, but they were rather busy. excellent location for taking a walk on the moors."
always very busy. service can take some time. value for money is ok. location is great. nice for a lunch and / or dinner
the restaurant is beautifully located and a great place to have lunch after a long walk. food is very good. in summer time they have a great terrace. dogs are allowed in the restaurant.
a very nice restaurant and terrace with excellent food! the restaurant is situated in the nature surrounded by fields with the occasional sheep strutting along. a great place for children to run and play. a great terrace for enjoying a cup of coffee or a glass of wine!
one of the nices places to have lunch or coffee after a walk on the heather fields in blaricum . lovely terras with well prepared lunch meals and great desserts . a place to be recommended
"the location is prepared for (little) childeren. the personnel also think about the little ones. the lunch was great, tasteful and more than enou "
"this restaurant is very popular during the day in the weekends with visitors who come for a walk in the nature reserve and the sheep shed nearby, and in the evening the locals take over. at lunch during the week you will often find some business people too. the menu is relatively simple but affordable. food is decent for the price, especially in this region. service varies a bit, they can get overloaded at busy times. they have a limited wine card but all choices are honest and drinkable wines. weekday during lunch and evenings there is usually enough free parking too. lunchtime in a sunny weekend - prepare to be forced to park at quite distance! their web based reservation system works well, so you wont go up there for naught."
"we had a nice walk to get to tafelberg and once we arrived on a misty afternoon, it was a welcome sight...bustling with adults, kids and dogs. the atmosphere was casual and welcoming...the service a little less welcoming-it waivered between rushed and non-existent, the menu was somewhat eclectic and the food was good...not great. but still we had a lovely time and i would recommend it for a quick bite-reservations seem essential. i would imagine in the summer months the outdoor dining is excellent. keep in mind my very good rating is mostly due to the beautiful setting."
"reservations recommended, especially for a saturday night. it was bustling with both small and large groups. food outstanding: carpaccio of smoked duck breast, tomato soup with a big dollop of cream, succulent veal. all with efficient and friendly service."
it does not matter if its breakfast lunch or dinner the atmosphere here is always very good and the walks fabulo 
problem with the tafelberg is that it is always full (especially outside) when its nice weather. so yesterday evening was a pleasant surpri 
"the perfect place dor coffee,tea, lunch, drinks or dinner after a nice walk in the country side! friendly staff good food! country side is worth a visit combined with relaxing in tafelberg"
we had a family dinner here. they have an extensive menu which is nice. food was good. service was a bit slow. we ordered some bread which they brought together with the main course which is too bad. my daughter was going to get french fries with her main course and this also arrived 10 minutes lat 
i had lunch here with some colleagues. the service was decent and tafelberg seizoensproeverij wild (game meat tasting platter) that i had was really nice! the platter was nicely prepared and well seasoned. i would recommend giving it a t 
"we live close to the tafelberg and walk our dogs in the surrounding every day. so that means we visit here for a coffee almost everyday, and sometimes lunch. the location and terrace area is superb. the drinks and food are consistently great value for money and good quality. the staff are always friendly and helpfu "
"situated next to a heath, a tranquil relaxing place with excellent food, the service was slighly slow but pleasant and friendly, the food was filling and very reasonably priced,"
"great place to spend a whole sunday afternoon.after a satisfying lunch bring the dog and take a stroll on the nearby heatherarea, and come back for coffee. the menu card is versatile and the wine list does not break your ba "
"the location is great, with a view over the moorlands. its easy to reach with ample parking. the staff is friendly, but not warm. the food is tasty but not delicious. we tend to use this place for quick lunch meetings or a coffee, but not for a great dinner out. "
a cosy restaurant and hotel.  the food is good.  had a soup and hamburger.  both tasted good and prepared well.
after a very friendly reception we were well taken care of in a pleasant and informal setting. we could choose from a good variety of dishes. the food was well-prepared and of high quality.
"a lovely evening meal for the family. great waiting staff who were very pleasant, along with excellent food for us and our young children."
"blaricum is one of the poshest places in the netherlands. so, one could expect an attitude, yet not in bellevue. ive been a couple of times for a coffee or a nice meal. the atmosphere is relaxed, staff very helpful, food good and nicely priced."
"this is located in the beautiful village of blaricum, with its old farm houses, and is a great spot for a nice family lunch or dinner. food is very good, and consistent, service friendly, and they have great sandwiches, salads and entrees. we eat there often, when in the netherlands, and i redcommend it."
"we found zon en zand while looking for a new place to eat near the beach villas. my husband, adult daughter and i were the only customers on a monday evening in early february. they pulled out all the stops for us. they were featuring a beer from texel island which was delicious and gave us some free glasses to take home. we were interested in fish so they made us a wonderful platter of three fishes and some shrimp, vegetables and potats. all wonderful. complimentary limoncello to top it off. it was a feast. we were delighted in every way and would recommend it highly. the atmosphere was very warm and elegant on a bitter cold night. the service and food quality were wonderful."
i absolutely loved it there.  we had lunch and then came back for diner. both were absolutely amazing! i will certainly come back here.
"we whent with the familie to eat today, kids where happy with their nuggets and me and my wife had a lovely pasta , a carbonara and i had the aglio , one of the best ive ever taste "
this beach bar has a bit more of fancy feel than most others in hoek van holland. the food is good as well and the staff is friendly.
"this restaurant is a place where food and drinks are served perfectly to customers. grilled half chicken and cold beer, thats what i ordered here and everything was tasteful.üçó"
"perfect food, nice and friendly people and the place is realy clean. nacho‚Äôs where outstanding with corona and sunshine"
"we stopped for pre-dinner drinks.  it was quite busy but service was unduly slow.  friendly and welcoming.  nice place to spend an hour or two, on the beach"
weve been here for a number of times and every time it was a great experien 
"we used tripadvisor to select this place among 35 competitors. it fully lived up to our expectations, food is great, staff is very friendly and customer oriented. we had a great evening with a great sunset and warming fire at our table. make sure you visit this place when in the neighbourhoo "
"lovely little place to relax by the beach. plenty of choice regarding where to sit, lots of shaded areas and sun spots to suit everyone. restaurant inside is lovely and cool really airy and nice atmosphere. would like to come back with friends for cocktails on the beach someti "
"we visited this restaurant based on the good reviews, and we were pleasantly surpris "
"perfect spare ribs, delicius zeebraas, fresh prawns ever and a friendly man who nows the best of all"
"a very nice beach bar that serves excellent food, probably the best restaurant of all the beach bars at hoek van holland."
korean chicken sandwich- nicely prepared. chicken not deep fried and therefore feels healthy too.   chicken burger - chicken balls deep fried as patties in between the buns and very tasty   coffees are full of options.   pastries. try the stroopwaffle cheesecake. a nice combination.
a bit pricey but as expected for a beachfront restaurant. nice staff and friendly service. the food was worth the money and service was fast enough. the kid enjoyed the activities nearby.
"good food, best we had on the hoek beach. friendly staff, nice restaurant. a bit pricy but not more than you‚Äôd expect for a place on the beach."
"we were at the beach and got hungry. we passed it the first time and it looked very nice and cozy. after passing all restaurants we went back and didn‚Äòt regret it. the restaurant hast such a nice atmosphere, the food was great and the price was ok."
"really close to the ferry terminal. we needed to eat somewhere as we had arrived early. the food was tasty, quickly served and good value. thoroughly recommend here"
"we went for a bit to eat before getting onto he ferry to the uk. service very good, quick, although not rushed. the food was plentiful and of high standard. thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
"ordered the indonesian ricetaffel and what a huge portion, there must have been enough for three even it was just me. the taste was great and service excellent and the price was very reasonable. highly recommendable"
"had the indonesian set menu, with a selection of meat and veggies in various sauces.  nice atmosphere and good service. the fried banana desert was so good piping hot when it came, i had some straight away,"
"after four weeks of fantastic food in scandinavia we were waiting for a ferry to the uk and discovered this gem. the owner served us very quickly and with humor, the food was terrific, just what we needed."
"we stopped here on the way to the ferry. we had a few hours to wait and decided to try the food. the staff were very welcoming, especially as we were a group of bikers who had been camping and on the road all day. the menu is huge, such and amazing choice of dishes. i had the chicken in a szechuan sauce with fried rice. my mate had the usual standby sweet and sour chicken. mine was amazing and the portions were huge. i tried his chicken balls and ill tell you what they didnt come from iceland best batter ive ever tasted and the sauce was to died for. the staff could not do enough for us. loved this place. also the menu is in english if you look closely at the small print."
"the best thing about this indonesian. chinese restaurant is that the staff also have their meals there, shows that they are happy to eat along with customers. food is of generous portions, and well cooked. loads of choice with a really good atmosphere"
i was happy to find that ocean city is still as good as 10 years ago. plenty of choice for a reasonable price. and even on a monday evening still busy enough
"for years the best chinese restaurant nearby. with kantonese specialties like teak-pan. but also a good choice for take away. not very cheap, not too expensive. nice service from chinese, but all dutch (born) speaking personel."
we use this restaurant regularly before we get on the ferry to england. the service is very friendly and quick. the menu has a great choice and everything we have ordered has been tasty and fresh. there is a childrens menu and lovely ice cream desserts for th 
so we decided to visit the 2 seasons aga 
"we were here in june, the staff is really friendly. it is on the beach with an really big inside sitting area wit the kitchen and a bar, and a pretty big outside area where you sit on the beach. there little fireplaces on the terrace and inside, inside there places with couches where you can just sit and relax with the fireplaces and enjoy the sunset over the beach. theyre dogfriendly, and have drinks and snacks for dogs. the staff is really friendly and interested in their customers. the food was good and the atmosphere was relaxing. "
"it was not busy. it was sunny but windy so we decided to sit inside. nice atmosphere. the food was good, generous portion and the services were above average."
we decided spontaneously to go out for dinner and chose the 2seasons for its dinner buff 
"we were lucky to choose this one as its along a very temptomg stretch of pubs cum restaurants along the beach. in april during weekdays there were not many people. despite that, service and food was great. we can recommend the burger and the chicken sandwich on wholemeal bread (the dutch version has something to do with a forest i recall). the portions were much bigger than we thought (and exactly like we wished for ;-)) and the taste was great."
plus: delicious and well presented food. very nice staff. outside seating at the beach. minus: a bit longer waiting time for the food but overall it was wort the time!  very nice place to eat.
"we started to wonder if wed chosen the right place to eat, since the restaurants to either side were packed, and this one was nearly empty, but we were quite happy with our meal "
"last week my family and i visited 2seasons. wed never heard of a live cooking diner, but the waiter explained everythin "
"we visited this lounge like restaurant just after boxing day, with three children and four adul "
2 seasons is the best spot to go on the beach! always a lot of fun had at this place! perfect to have some drinks and dinner with friends and watch the sun go down! would recommend this place to everyone!!
"been here last week to have the live cooking dinner... what a suprise everything whas really nice and we enjoyed our time here.(especially the large chocolate fountain) very pleasant staff, nice atmosfere, and very co "
"its what you want when sitting at a terrace, no pressure, enjoy life and have a drink and bite. enjoy the view and people. very polite staff. price/quality in balance. big portions of food. dont eat all the bread befor your dinner starts, it will fill you."
"a restaurant with friendly stuff, great atmosphere, a place to have your normal dinner in a reasonable price with great beer!!!"
"friendly staff welcomed us to the terrace. 2 tables could be merged into 1 when we explained our group of 5 was a household. good food and great atmosphere. if im in the neighborhood again and looking for a restaurant, this would be my preferred choice. "
"we stopped here for a quick bite before taking the boat on the meuse. centraal is situated on baarlo‚Äôs main square, baarlo itself being a beautiful little town full of historic houses and a magnificent castle. at centraal my wife had a toasted sandwich which i wish i had chosen, it was simply beautiful, the highlight being the exquisite bread which i‚Äôm told is baked on the premises. superbly crunchy on the outside, a soft, near sponge like pale yellow interior, seriously nearly the best bread i‚Äôve ever eaten. my croquettes were good, again on this great bread, but the toasted sandwich, with smoked ham and local cheese oozing from its every orifice, was another level.!"
"this lovely gastro-pub in the center of baarlo is a nice surprise. the quality of the food is very good, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere quiet enough for good conversation. a great place for a small group dinner if youre visiting the area around venlo."
overall we all had a great experience he 
"i enjoyed an excellent meal with the european business team here this past week. the menu was surprisingly varied, although i think the local choices are always best. i had some roasted venison and it was delicious. oh, and it is a pub so the beer was great!"
"great atmosphere and friendly, helpful staff. good range of beer and fantastic hamburger! our visit to baarlo wouldn‚Äôt have been as enjoyable or memorable if we hadn‚Äôt discovered centraal."
we parked our cars near this cafe/restaurant before setting off on a cycle trip. officially the establishment opened at 11am but they let us in at 10am for coffee. at the end of the day we returned for a very tasty meal.
"the location is worth a visit by itself, an amazing array of different gardens in the wild style of the 20th century dutch wave. the chef , alwin leemhuis, is cooking with organic ingredients from the garden and other local sources. the results are pure and very refined. friendly and kowledgable service offering exellent wine pairings. only open in summer weekends and very much worth a detour!"
"lots of choice in the menu, i like the pancakes thicker though like they were in the past. deserts were great!"
"we had lunch on the terrace while visiting this beautiful village! the concept is very nice, large choice and reasonable prices, a good experience!"
"above our table were balloons and a nice sign with happy birthday, so a warm welcome. pancakes (they have a lot of choices) tasted very good. desserts are original and delicious. when your kid is a member of the kidsclub, he/she gets coins to trade in for a present from the restaurant shop. want to have a nice time and good pancakes, this is the place to go!"
"we had a really great lunch here. had an italian pancake (like pizza, but not so heavy) and one with apple and xinnon as dessert.. i recommend this place to anyone. service is kind and fast. 5 stars"
"this restaurant as well as the town is not on the usual tourist map. it definitely is not on the indian tourist map. we discovered this place as our friends are the residents of the local village, hence this outi "
"i went to this restaurant twice because the pancakes there are incredible. i had the best pineapple and meat pancake ive tasted in the netherlands. the place is really quaint and cozy, and the menu comes in english if you need it. they make many different kinds of pancakes that are not sweet like in the u.s. but can be purchased if you want one. i dont know what the pancake was made from but it was the size of dinner plate. they have a small restroom down in the basement but you need to be able to walk down stairs to get to it."
"chose this restaurant when visiting with family. city centre ambiance. enormous selection of pancakes- fruit topped, pizza and so many others."
"we had a coffee break on the terrace.  the service was fast and friendly, the coffee was good as was the apple cake"
the range of different pancakes is enormous. of course we did not try all of them but the ones we tried were perfectly baked with nice ingredients.
strolled around heusden. so pretty especially around harbou 
i was there a couple of times. its always full located in the main square . wide range to choose from in the menu. the pancakes are delicious!
"we were tired but wanted a light lunch and pancakes seemed a perfect solution. i had bacon, raisins and apple,a combination which really worked. service was fine and coffee delicious"
they say who says bergen says de taverne. this place has been the centre of almost every cultural and especially musical outings. the atmosphere is so relaxed and happening. people of literally all ages walk in and mingle and enjoy each others company. the food thats being served is really tasty and original. it would be a shame if this place would dissapear for some reason. like it a lot! go there!
"we came to this cafe for the live music of matt woods our friends from knoxville. the band should perform at 9.00 pm but finally it was at 10.00 pm. the cafe offers drink and food for reasonable price but they had only one menu though its changed daily. as the cafe is not really big so its getting crowded as soon as the band played and it was really full house when it rain outside. nice folks and place. one minus point was the strong cigarette smoke from outside got inside, too"
"nice atmosphere. even my 8-year old daughter loved it, especially the duck breast, which was the plate of the day. i would come back any time and recommend it."
"we celebrated a family reunion of seven and were seated at the central large table for dinner. the restaurant has one fixed dish that changes daily. this time it consisted kabeljouw and stamppot (cod and a pur√©e with vegetables), a very tasty typical dutch fare.the vegetarian plate was a combination of tempura vegetables with the same ‚Äústamp pot‚Äù, which was well received by the three vegetarians. there was a large wine and tap beer selection. this is a great place for a reasonably priced meal in a very cozy setting in the heart of town."
"wonderful music and a lovely bar. definitely worth visiting. they have a enormous range of beverages, from single malt whiskeys to the darkest beers. and last but not least.. the staff is incredibly helpful and ive never seen them without a smile."
"nice place, often hosts live music. some big ones passes the review, among whom even joe cocker and other mayor artists."
"we were a bit skeptical, the prices were quite high. but the food quality was very good and in combination with the location worth every cent."
"we were looking for a place to visit the beach which was not too distant from the car park and found this hidden gem we never visited before. the beach is close to the paved access road and an interesting double array of dunes with a inner lake just behind the first row of dunes. this is well suited for kite surfing. on the other side is the beach bar & restaurant luctor & emergo and this is a classic beach joint which holland is so famous for. the place is large, both inside and outside with plenty of seats behind the glass walls to keep the sea breeze out. the place lends itself for sunbathing but even more for having drinks and/or lunch. there are enough servants to help you rapidly and the menu has lots of choice with text in dutch and german. dogs are allowed but must be kept on the leech and the high situated terrace is quite suitable to keep and eye on the kite surfers at sea. a great find and we surely will come again here."
strandtenten or beach restaurants - one of those great institutions in the netherlands. they are literally build on the beach designed to make the most of the views and the weath 
"delicious cake also vegan, good coffee and very friendly, polite service stuffüòÉ thank you very muchüòä"
"lovely wee restaurant with superb cook preparing great breakfasts, cakes, lunches, afternoon teas and snacks. excellent coffee, but also licensed, so wine etc on hand. friendly staff and nice setting. sit outside for people watching."
we appreciated the recommendations of sushi and we were very satisfied with the lobster and the black angus. even the bread and dips was very good
"together with my youngest brother and his wife , we had an amazing experience here. excellent service  excellent food  excellent wines the atmosphere is almost unique!"
"we went to this restaurant for my birthday meal. the owner was so welcoming and made the experience so special. we had the three course menu, the food was faultless. we also had the wine pairing with each meal (the best chardonnay i‚Äôve ever had!!). a cozy restaurant hidden away in bergen with a friendly atmosphere. if you find yourself in bergen this restaurant is a must visit!"
"absolutely incredible restaurant, we came for a family birthday meal and the host couldn‚Äôt have been more friendly. the food was so delicious, with exquisite wine pairings throughout the meal. hidden away in the charming town of bergen this is a must-visit restaurant we thoroughly enjoyed our meal here."
"we had a great dinner at ‚Äöware jakob‚Äò - food was excellent and wine pairing a nice fit. owner is a charming, talkative guy who creates a very welcoming atmosphere‚Ä¶ definitely a recommendation!"
due to covid restrictions only lunch could be seeved. but it was  delicious . great service. a bit hidden but definetly worthwhile  visiting.
"this place is absolutely worth going to. very young team in the kitchen, but they really know their job well. the owner who will help you chose and serves as well could be an actor , he is fun and nice to have around . food was great , a place we will be visiting again"
this is the second time we had dinner here. we always get a lovely welcome from the owner of the place who also work the 
"i ate here with friends and had a fabulous time. the staff are truly excellent, making you feel like an old friend. i could not fault the service. and the food, with matching wines was stunning and delicious. a wonderful, tasty and relaxed evening!"
yet another good restaurant in bergen. this one a little out of the way but well worth the visit. food is very good and the staff is very nice.
"if you feel like a real nice dinner, take your time and go to the ware jacob.  since im a vegetarian its always a surprise what you get, but its always good. nice wines and friendly staff."
"relaxed atmosphere, great cooking. not very posh, just right for an excellent evening out. let them advise you on what they would recommend, both in food and wine. youll love it!"
"small menu, but you can have it anyway you want it. the food is, untypically by dutch standards, refined and the portions copious. good wines at reasonable prices and great service. the owners and staff are very friendly, not an obvious characteristic in holland..."
"very tasty chinees food. luxury fish dishes (oyster, large shrimp, etc) and of course also beef and chicken. all served with a variety of spices and vegetables. we choose twice for the  surprise menu and where both time pleasantly surprised by the (off-menu) choices. very friendly service. "
as always this restaurant was great. the food is special and tasty.  the service is very good.  try the tie pan with chicken and teriyaki sauce
we had an excellent diner and excellent service. the atmosphere is very modern and unlike most chinese restaurants. try the fresh coconut icecream.
"it doesnt look like a chinese restaurant in the first sight. no red colour, no lantern, no chinese letters, just white building with dutch letters. the interior is quite modern, sleek style, white chairs, here and there some buddha statues or paintings on the wall. but when you look at the menu card, they have a lot of chinese cuisine. and also the staff are in black and very friendly. they listened to what the guest want and made it for you. the food was delicious. good service and quick served."
"the chinese food was excellent and very tasty. especially the tipan with beef.  the restaurant looks very modern, clean and has chinese influences.  the service was friendly but very chaotic and rushed and they looked understaffed. but the food and friendliness made it all good."
"seemed a little posh for is when we walked in, but tastefully s "
"this rather expensive restaurant, serves good quality oriental food with a twist. its different then your local chinese take away. the staff is very friendly and helpful!"
"always very good service,friendly and caring.the food is good and the prices are really okay compare to other restaurants in this village. we went there several times and we always have a ood evening there.thanks!"
"duinvermaak is a relaxed place focusing on pizza and pancakes. for the latter they have many choices, and i liked the one with bacon and apples. service was friendly and efficient."
"this is an ideal restaurant for eating lunch, dinner or just for a drink after walking in the beautiful woods around bergen and schoorl. it also has a terrace area outside (great in the afternoon sun) and has a free car park just opposite (which can get quite busy in the weekend "
"this place does two things and they do them really well - pancakes of every type and description and pizzas. we had a combination and everyone was happy with their choice. service ok, albeit a bit harried as the place was packed to the seams."
"various members of our family have been visiting this establishment for a number of years. the restaurant is a lovely old building, in a nice setting. there is an excellent choice of pancakes, especially so for my vegetarian wife. the place was totally buzzing with activity, but the staff were all incredibly helpful and friendly and considering how busy it was the service was of a high standard. next time we are in holland we will be back!"
"crepe with ü•ì, üßÄ and üçÑ ! add a üç∫ and a ‚òïÔ∏è.  friendly and efficient staff, many folks brought their dogs into eatery.  great spot."
"have enjoyed quite a few meals at this bar/restaurant i usually go with one of their capriosca pizzas and the bases always impress me, nice, crispy yet doughy consistency, a good range of drinks, friendly staff, good location for after a mountain bike ride in the labyrinth of tracks and trails in the nearby duins. also great for young families and offers a playground for children to run around in with outside al la carte seating. charming old building with a lot of local bergen histo "
great diner and very nice service  
"thanks to a great recommendation from my nephew we have enjoyed a great lunch here.  awesome kids area and great pancakes.  very relaxing, good service and a picturesque location amongst trees.  well worth a diversion for the tourist."
take all my visitors here for the best pancakes in north holland. as a family we have also been. service is good. staff friendly
"located at the foot of the bergen-schoorl dunes this restaurant serves very good food at reasonable prices. it is a family favorite especially when the kids are hungry for pizza or pancakes. hey, there is even a playground for the youngsters."
"i visitedd this place few times with my husband and it was busy all the time! the people like it, the people come back again and i dont blame them. we will too! the food is all time fresh and ready to be enjoyed in a short time even when theres no time to breathe for the staff. the pizzas are wonderful and the pancakes afterwards are heavy to handle, but a must! with wonderful architecture and interior of the place, the experience is just delicious!"
"when i lived in the area some 25 years ago, we frequently used to come here for their famous pancakes. they still did not disappoint and i was also pleasantly surprised by the (to me) new look of the place. looking forward to coming again!!!"
typical family restaurant with very reasonable prices and a large selection of pizzas and pancakes.
"pizzas, pancakes and other stuff. my family and i really enjoy their food and wonderful atmosphere. great food at reasonable prices. we go here several times per year."
"this is such a nice restaurant, very relaxed, for all agegroups young or old. they are the top when it comes to pancakes, pizzas, icecream, soup, cake. coffee, tea e "
this is definitely a family restaurant with children and dogs welcome. there is a childrens playground and a bowl of water for dogs. the pancakes are good with lots of choices; they are very thin by n. american standards but that is what makes them so good; pizzas are fine and also thin. a pizza/pancake per person is usually the norm. they have recently rebuilt; although the restaurant is roomier it has become much noisier. it is very busy in the summer/weekends. reserve ahead of time if possible. prices are quite reasonable.
we come here regularly and besides good pancakes can recommend their pizzas good place for a very quick meal
"very special pizza combinations, but i love them...still do...pancakes are very jummy as well....this place is absolutely worth visiting..very affordable and just good quality of food...."
"this is one of our favourite restaurants, a place where we go quite regular "
good simple food. well priced. staff friendly. great location by park entrance. perfect place for post cycle visit.
"what a wonderful way to finish a long day cycling ,completely off road on trails through the wonderful dune national pa "
"you know the dutch pancakes ? you can have them here. great quality! furthermore pizzas, until 5.00 pm also poffertjes are available ... breadrolls, salads, etc. the forests/dune-area starts just across the street, and it is a bit on the border of bergen, hence a bit on the quieter side compared to the core of bergen. nice building as well, of course you can bring your dog or kid, playground outside."
one of us has a lengthy list of allergies and things unable to eat. those were well noted and well-taken care of! applauses for th 
"i could write a lengthy description about our experience at this place, however, most accurate is maybe the following: we have been to 1 star michelin places where we have had food which was not as good as the menu we had here, try yourself!"
"we wish we had discovered the bourbon room earlier - we would certainly have come again. the chef‚Äôs menu offers terrific dishes, with surprising, impressive flavours. i do recommend taking at least four courses. the wines complement the dishes very well. there‚Äôs a nice atmosphere in the restaurant, with the chefs compiling the dishes behind the bar and knowledgeable yet informal staff."
my wife and me had a great time last night at the bourbon ro 
"we have been travelling through europe for 9 months. this is the best restaurant in the netherlands. amazing food, service and ambience.  thank you for an amazing experience all round....keep doing what you do."
highly recommended. great fresh and seasonal food. er had five courses. perfect service and perfect atmosphere.
"food was very good, service nice and friendly. only thing was: far too long waiting between courses..."
"we used to come quite often to restaurant la locanda/silhouet la locanda in heiloo; these days the master chief was cooking there. his name is fernando jonker. then, suddenly, this miracle worker disappeared from heiloo and we were unable to localize him. fortunately, as a result of a local advertisement in a glossy, we found his new whereabouts: at the approx. 1-1.5 year old the bourbon room - that we have passed a couple of time in the last year - without knowing that our chief was working here. we could not wait to be seated by a very friendly waiter and in a simple, though friendly atmosphere we enjoyed fernandos cooking arts. the first dish of the surprise 4 course menu consisted of a very fresh and nice tasting beef carpaccio; the next one was a fish course (skrie) and the next one was a selection of veal - all very nicely balanced - with matching wines. for all those people who like myself do not eat (sweet) deserts - pls make an exception here - it is more than worth it! the chief came to our table to say hello and promised us to cook our favorite dish from the old tim "
very professional and good 4 course chef recommendation. nice restaurant layout and the service was personal and excellent.
"beautiful foodbar restaurant, fine good dishes. definitely a must for the gstronome but also cozy for a tasty snack during the cocktail ho "
"we had a very relaxing and friendly meal tonight. the waitress was very helpful and spoke good english, and apologised for not having english menus, though she offered to translate if we needed help. there was a nice choice of food and a range of prices - ‚Ç¨10 for crayfish cocktail, ‚Ç¨10 for pizza, ‚Ç¨20 for steak. also vegetarian meals, fish and pasta. nice desert and speciality coffee menu, but we were too full to try. not too busy tonight, about 6 other parties, so it was a relaxed atmosphere and not too rushed. "
the restaurant is positioned directly at the beach with a great view on the north sea (including sunset üòÅ) we went there for a coffee but since the weather was nice we stayed a bit longer. so we had a couple of beers/wines and a very tasty bread platter with tasteful food on it. the staff was very friendly so all and all we had a very enjoyable stay at the beach. 
good sea food and efficient service. nice choice of beers. free parking. nice views of the harbor. reasonable prices.
"the restaurant is situated close to the port to go to schiermonnikoog and has teracces on both sides, so easy to sit out of the wind. views are nice on the island. food was of good quality, though the warm parts of the fish platter was a bit heavy. service can move a notch up. great after a long walk"
to our surprise the sheltered sea side terrace wasnt fully booked on this lovely summer d 
"a well deserved lunch break on the top of the dike near the ferry port to schiermonnikoog. the restaurant looks clean and cosy, the waitress welcomed us friendly and showed the menu. we ordered cappuccino 3/5, apple pie with cream 4/5 and the local burger with salad and samphire 3/5. a good place for an hungry traveller."
we visited for coffee as we were early for the boat to schiermonnikoog. excellent coffee and friendly staff but what caught our eye was the fish menu. it was too early to even consider food but it was temptin 
"we were at this restaurant as the location seemed great. it turned out to have a great view from the terrace. moreover the collection of fish was nice and quality was great. lovely service, good food at a great location. must go if around."
this wonderfully located waterside restaurant offers a good selection of localnfare but the salads are not to be missed.  service first class with english spoken.
"friendly service. quietly serving, not fast. the menu was good. quality of the food was good. we think, in hoogerheide el sueno is a choice, you will not regret."
was here this week with a group of 5 persons. it is a small restaurant with not too many tables but with good weather one can eat in the private garden terrace. the food is outstanding better than we have been eating in many restaurants recently! the fish and meat dishes were excellent and fresh and also the starters and deserts were absolutely fantastic. all 5 agreed on this so it must be tr 
"this is a very nice restaurant. contemporary interior design and very nice staff. not too crowded, and a sufficient menu. worth going to."
"it was our first time at ‚Äòbij de pastorij‚Äô and we enjoyed it very much. delicious food, friendly staff,  good atmosphere!!"
the ambiance of this restaurant is atmospheric. excellent service. we had a tasty game menu. the waiter gave the perfect wine advice.
we took my mother-in-law for a birthday treat and the meal was enjoyed by us a 
"the place is packed on saturday nights. beer is included but alcohol, ribeye, and a hamburger are extra above the ‚Ç¨30 entry fee. food is fresh and as the name implies ‚Äútasty  "
"all-you-can-eat place with not only chinese food, also bbq. not to crowded on thursday night. we payed 26 ‚Ç¨ / person 2,5 h of eating. soft drinks, beer and wine included. very friendly staff. no so clean toilet."
"ok, its an all-you-can-eat place... ok, its not run by japanese people, and ok, it proposes some kind of fusion cuisine... i guess some of these points may sound not nice for purists of japanese or wok food, anyway i have to say tasty world proposes very good quality and large choice of foods, including some european style pas "
"great place to stay, staff and owners where excellent , buffet food was great . as we were staying for three weeks the owner just said to us if we want any different food they would be happy to accommodate ,was a joy to stay here for three wee "
we had a lovely dinner at boove en beneeje.  enjoying the ambience of sitting on a terrass in the evening sun. excellent food and friendly attentive waitress. extra fun seeing a hot air balloon launch from across the street.
we made the 2.5 hour drive to hoogerheide to visit family and was recommended to bove en benee 
we were taken here by our dutch friends who live close by. a lovely place with nice decor with plenty of room around your table. the menu is varied and we had about 5 dishes each some were really nice but others a little bland to be honest but all edible. they sold some nice strong beers which was a bonus
"we enjoyed dinner here with our family. food is very good, much better than might be expected in a smaller town. service and portions are above city standards and complement the dishes served. and to top it all, they have really great wines for your choosing, when you pay a bit of attenti "
"this restaurant has been around for 20 years. about 10 years ago we discovered this restaurant by coincidence. searching for a place serving game. if you love game and good red wine, this is the place to be. get the game menu, serving 4 or 5 courses. guide the owner to help you finding a good red. provide him with some tips and let him do the searching. this culinary surprise is going to leave you flabergasted. ill be back again."
"high class dining here. good wines, good service. during season also deer and other specialties. also very good for a drink and bite oursite."
this place is famous for their game menu. today we had 12 pieces menu. due to driving i only had one white and one red wine. the owner loves wines and foe enthusiasts he has surprising wines in stock. it is the drive more then worthy. do make a reservation. lunch or dinner is fine. perhaps a b&b will complete your party. 
"very good dutch dishes. well executed and very tasty. a good selection of steaks, schnitzels, chicken dishes, meat balls, hack steak etc. all supplied with generous servings of very good fries, sautee potatoes, salads and vegetables. sizable portions so you will not leave hung "
"enjoyed dinner here with our family. food is well prepared, great quality (especially the meat) and abundant quantity. service is very friendly and attentive. we thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
my friend lives locally and always comes here. we all had the set menu and the portions were gigantic! i had the tomato soup for starters and then the steak. there was so much food that i couldnt eat the fries and vegetable 
"good old fashioned food, meat 3 fresh veg and 2 potatoes dishes x 2 plus drinks for a fraction ove ‚Ç¨50,00. top marks"
"amazing place. food was really good, staff very friendly, really child friendly with huge play area outside and small activity stations inside - makes all the difference to having a relaxed stress free family meal with young children. well definitely be back while on holiday in de twee bruggen (20 minutes easy bike ride with kids)! "
"great pancakes, super nice burger, kids playing corner, nice train-like atmosphere. a great place if you are looking for something special and like pancakes."
we visited this pancake house on the way back from an energetic morning in the swimming po 
"good pancakes, but also all other things to eat. this place is special for childrens entertainment, they can play outsite with a broad spectrum of items. parent can enjoy a drink during the play time. a good place to stay and they offer a lot other things like catering and so on."
"easy going accomodation when travelling by car, bike or hiking on the old main road between zwolle and apeldoorn"
"this restaurant is a small town treasure. the pannenkoekens we had here were among the best we have ever had. the service was very good and the place has atmosphere. it has both indoor and outdoor seating. being a nice day, we sat outside and really enjoyed our food and the attentive service."
"great little cafe in bruinisse ... open when other places were closed. johnny is a great host ... his chicken skewers were prefect and his frites were great. i wanted to go back and get some more chicken ... and perhaps and ice cream cone, but we ran out of time, but if i am back in the area ... i will make a stop at johnnys."
i speak dutch but cant write it so i tell you in english. we had very good and delicious food and we will come back soon
"we visited on a very quiet wednesday night , we were the only ones to dine in as i think they do lots of take away orders . we ordered a mushroom and pineapple pizza , a chicken and ham pizza and a meat calzone with generous toppings all terrific , i‚Äôm a bit of a pizza expert and i go with the smell of the dough and crispness of the base , it was devine . just wished i stayed nearer oh and the staff were very nice as well . 10/10"
"being in zeeland for a long weekend we ordered 2 pizzas for delivery hoping theyd be ok. in fact, we were really surprised how good they were. good dough and quality of ingredients at a reasonable price. we rally didnt expect to get such pizza quality in this area and can truly recommend it. we didnt visit the restaurant itself so cant say anything about the place / service."
"we were staying in the area and found the food here to be delicious. they also do pizza but we didnt try it, opting instead for the turkish specialties all of which were tasty. tap beer was inexpensive and good. portions were plentiful. they have a nice dining room and outdoor seating as well. a pleasant experience overall."
"we visited several times in august. we came here for lunch, dinner and drinks and loved it every time. the food was delicious, we had lunch, cakes and dinner dishes and all were well. friendly and quick service. our son liked it here. theres a playground near the terrace and its adjacent to a forest play area, which is super fun for kids. "
"what a great location in the forest , all the mains we had where very good as where the deserts . service was ok and friendly , and we had a option to sit outside or inside which was nice as it was a lovely sunny afternoon."
"in the midst of the herpen forest near the city of oss youll find this old rebuilt villa with its contempory stylish interior. while it is most known for the traditional dutch pannekoeken in a variety of tastes i can also recommend the other dishes on the menu. the chefs team is up to any challenge as it seems to dish up delicious seafood as easily as a fine-food course of beef, pork or any other carnivorous guilty pleasures. be sure t slap this one one your short list if you are in the den bosch region while wanting to dine out with collegues, friends or family!!"
"as an american having lived in the netherlands, this is possibly one of the best restaurants value and quality wise i have ate a "
after a hike in de herperduinen is a stop at pan & zo a must. service is very good! food is excellent!
"we always have a good time going out for a truly phantastic pancake here. the restaurant is located beautifully in the forest and its interior is very nice. a good place for food, coffee or drinks after a walk in the forest. and if you dont like pancakes, you should really try one! otherwise they have also a choice of other items on the menu."
i watched this restaurant getting built and was curious to know how it would go as there is another restaurant close by. i walk in the forest that surrounds the restaurant every week as i am a local so i was excited to finally go in and try it. they have really invested in a stylish and modern restaurant with trendy decor. it is cozy in winter and the great big doors open up to a sunny terrace. even though it is a pancake restaurant it is not a typical kids one you would imagine. it has a variety of food and yes kids are welcome but there is something for everyone. the prices are affordable and the food is ample. (the pancakes i can never finish!). if you are in herpen duin and you shouldnt miss out in having a coffee here after a walk/run/cycle. you can also plan a nice evening out here because its always friendl 
"have visited this place several times. outstanding atmosphere. last time during the marriage of our son and daughter in law. good food, excellent staff. will go back soon to celebrate our birthdays etc."
"a foreigners here, the team have been amazing with the warm hospitality and the food exceeded expectations. i highly recommend this as an alternative to a meal at center parcs as a date night. we had the surprise me menu that was really awesome."
"excellent non traditional and smart dishes,and a service with a smile and willingness to address our kids special requests."
"we love this place, nice food and family run.  it was our saviour as we stayed at centre parks (which we enjoy) but the restaurants aren‚Äôt very good there."
heavy traffic jams on the highway made us go an alternative route and we saw this nice place at the heyen industrial park. what a nice surprise; perfect salads for lunch!
"the service was awesome, toys for kids, different seats for babies and also for younger children who also want a high chair. toys for the kids while waiting for food and the food! everyone was pleased including the kids. also recommend the beer tasting. we are at the nearby center parcs and the food here is of great quality. we got lovely suggestions also on what to see nearby, thank you for all."
"we had pancakes for our lunch. a small range of toppings were on offer. they were a decent size for lunch. maybe because we were in a group of five but some of the pancakes were a bit undercooked and they were a bit on the stodgy and heavy side. quite pricey, but this is quite a remote location"
"in geesteren, a small village in the achterhoek in holland, i discovered a great kitchen at baan restaurant. the food was delicious and the shrimp croquettes were amazing tasty. beautiful decoration of the dishes and friendly people. i stayed here just a few days, but visited the restaurant two times. when i would come here again i will definitely go back."
"very crowdy but good choices ice from good quality good plces to sit and enjoy ,people are very friendly"
"the ice-salon has a great selection of very good ice, and friendly staff. at the back you can see the production of ice going on. the place is very clean."
"very nice dinner with the family, all adults. restaurants looks beautiful and the staff is very friendly. portions are very generous and taste good."
"bloody good steak...  we entered the restaurant with our dogs, which is no problem...first positive impression. very friendly staff...second positive impression.  we ordered the tomahawk steak for two... when it arrived at the table...grilled to perfection in medium. perfect taste.  thanks....will be back again."
"we visited on a cold snowy january evening. despite not many guests the restaurants natural atmosphere shone through. the restaurant menu is very good and i can recommend the bbq pork ribs. the service was quick, though i‚Äôm sure on an ‚Äúin season‚Äù weekend the place would be very busy."
"if youre expecting great food, probably not the place for you, but if you just want to enjoy drinks and snacks/simple meals whilst looking out over the sea, this is a great place. you can be in full sun outside, behind a glass screen sheltering from the wind, or even in doors still with great views. place is nicely done out and not just a beach shack. we really enjoyed it, but please be aware im not saying the food is 5 star, but i think the experience is."
"my wife insisted we go there, my expectations were low: it looks like a beach snack with soggy fries. but to my surprise, the food was much better. we went there twice and tried different courses. they all were better than expected, quite good actually. i had two different soups that didnt taste like convenience gastro-food. so, if youre in bathing trunks or a bit sweaty from a bike tour and dont feel at ease at nearby trendy paal6, go and enjoy them on the (somewhat wind protected) terrace."
"our favorite restaurant. good food, friendly staff,delicious sangria. various tapas, also for vegetarians"
"very nice place, friendly people and good service. food was delicious, although not everything to our taste. all was well prepared and tasted as it should.  will come again for sure."
"first visit to this restaurant and certainly not my last. tapas are delicious and so much choice. it was very busy and a bit crowded, not much space between tables or to move around. i do not like to have a huge dog sitting so close to me when i am eating."
"i really like this restaurant. it looks nice, the food is pretty good and the prices is also pretty good. you have a deal for 23,00 for all you can eat on friday and saterday and the rest of the week is het even cheape "
the selection of different foods on the menu was diverse and the preparation was well done.  the servers were polite and managed to provide you with an opportunity to choose more dishes.  i found this place most enjoyable.  very casual...
"the selection is perfect, except my wife wanted a steak. i opted for the lamb and it was perfectly prepared. great wine selection and the staff is friendly and very attentive."
dinner after family trip to tex 
many choices and good quality of food and service nice friendly people close to my home good for a whole evening sitting there
"what a lovely restaurant. we were a family of 9 with a mixture of adults and children. the owners were very welcoming, helpful and spoke english to us. the food was all delicious and everyone was happy with their choices. they had a children‚Äôs menu too. the menu had a good range of food and drinks. the decor inside is lovely. "
the food was excellent. the waitress friendly and fast. and they were very kind to my daughter and her friends!
menu offers more variety than the standard dutch seaside provision. well cooked with good friendly service.
"we ended up here by chance and were very pleasantly surprised. nice choice of dishes, very knowledgeable staff and very welcoming. the food was excellent as was the presentation."
i love this road restaurant. enter the netherlands and got some food here. visit also bad nieuweschans .
you got to be there. best watersport-location in zeeland. 360 grad good vabrations. all gear available. great hosts.
"we visited twice in just three days, we loved the style of the building, the location, variety of menu, and friendliness of the staff. well worth a visit and a nice walk down to the complex from nearby center parcs."
we had a nice dinner and could even bring our dog. something that is unfortunately not possible in the center parcs where we are stayi 
"went here for a dinner with 6 (2 kids). we reserved a spot and got seated on the 1st floor where it is a bit quiet. very nice as we wanted to catch up with some friends. ground floor is pretty noisy but it can be more convenient with (young) kids as the playground is situated there.we ordered a soup-of the day, and bruchettas and nachos to share. both bruchettas and the nachos were very good, in particular the sour-cream was excellent. portion sizes decent (also for the rest of the meals). mains were 2 kids menus (chicken nuggets and pancakes), kids menu is very extensive (compared to others). burger with fries, chicken satay skewers, poke bowl (vegan) and prime ribs (irish). when they served the food they forgot the burger. quickly apologies were made and the burger came very fast. eventually this was convenient as they shared the burger and the satay, so not bad all in all. desserts were stroopwaffel ice-cream, dame blanche and two ben and jerrys (cookie dough). the stroopwaffel ice-cream was not stroopwaffel ice-cream but vanilla ice-cream with pieces of stroopwaffel (and came with small liquor, baileys). fine by me but the menu could set you at false expectations. downside was the whipped cream was not so good, while they had hot chocolate including the real whipped cream. dont really get the reason for that. we ended up with some tea and coffee, very tasty. all in all we sat for more than three hours and had a great evening."
"we were staying at center parcs & visited 3 times, twice for dinner & once watching the kids on the hell sli "
"after a good saturday-morning exercise we decided to take our breakfast here. after ordering a large cappuccino and a double expresso we ordered the big-breakfast plate and a home-made granola yogurt (and honey) bowl. the place is nicely situated near the lake and has cabins where you can sleep for ht night, so (although in the morning) it was quite busy with people enjoying a good breakfast. close by you can surf the lake, paddle and do all kind of water-sports. inside there is a large restaurant but seen the fact it was beautiful weather there was no need going inside (but seen the ambiance and the menu we will for sure try dinner here soon too). the food was served in a timely manner, the granola-yoghurt was nicely presented in a glass pot with honey on the side. the breakfast plate was really huge, bread pistolet, more bread, croissant, egg (boiled, add scrambled was possible at a surcharche) jam, 2 types of butter, chocolate spread, chocolate sprinkles, ham, cheese, salami and an orange juice. this will get you kickstarted for the day! the granola-yoghurt was also very tasty and well portioned. price compared you do quite get a big more food for your money if you order the big-breakfast plate. anyway, we decided to stay i little (and order some more drinks) but i found out that you actually had to pay for wi-fi. sorry, but that is not 2018 like anymore. this might had to to with the houses etc. which are part of this premise. obviously your restaurant guests have to use the wi-fi for free (and i think the people who stay for the night also). at least offer a 3-4 hour free pass each day or something. anyway, we quickly finished our drinks and left. make the wi-fi free and you get full 5 stars (it also means more revenue as people will stay longer, thus eat and drink more). hope this is realised when we return here for dinner (which we for sure will do). service is excellent by the way, only when we were trying to get the bill it was kind of hard, no one was inside and eventually we just walked to someone on the terrace who immedialty presented us with the bill, so all good!"
"this place was excellent. great view and the interior was beautiful. the food was very good but portions were quite big so i would recommend not bothering with starters. child-friendly, good kids menu, playground outside and a kids movie area. we visited here several times and would really recommend their fries. great for a nice meal after a long bike ride. the staff were really friendly. would really recommend this!!!"
"we were staying in port zelande and wanted to try somewhere outside the resort. so glad we tried here, the location is great, the decor is lovely, the staff were very friendly and the food was delicious! would definitely recommend here for a drink or something to eat, wished wed found it on our first day and not our last!"
food and drinks are always very good here! we always come to this place when we are around. the place re-opened early this year and they created a very beautiful spot! the view is astonishing!
visited twice and loved the place. good food and water sports - if only there were places like this in uk.
"once we discovered this place, we visited almost every day! we tried paddle boarding and the slide. the staff are friendly and the site seems very safe. you can hire equipment with or without tuition. there is a restaurant and bar on site."
"a hidden gem - every dish was sublime with bold flavors and fresh ingredients. the spectacular food is served in beautiful dishes , in a super stylish restaurant with great service (not easy to find in nl). easily one of the more memorable dining experiences in the netherlands- was worth the 1.5hr drive from amsterdam for sure!"
"the restaurant is very beautiful and cozy, the menu offers a nice variety without being overwhelming. quality of the food was excellent, pricing is totally fair. the service was truly outstanding, our waiter noticed we‚Äòd ordered vegetarian dishes except one and came back to us to ask if that had been intentional or if we wanted to change our order. never encountered such a thoughtful and attentive service before. 5 stars in all areas, and we‚Äòll certainly be back. "
"had a great lunch here. lovely atmosphere, really well styled and good service. loved the risotto and carpaccio salad. served with great wines. recommended! something different than the standard dutch restaurants."
"we loved the 5 courses so much we added another course. perfect wine accommodations. perfect service. we went there hungry, we left satisfied. thank you"
my daughter and her friend selected this restaurant based on the modern look when walking by the closed restaurant the evening before. what an excellent surprise! great wine and food combinations served by the whole female staff. i had the 4 course surprise menu with wine arrangement together with my daughter and great 
delicious food with great care about gluten free options when asked (majority of menu is or can be served gluten free). the sommelier did a great job providing matching wines. service was lovely.
nice and friendly staff. the food was good and everything was in right time! i totally recommended it. the room was a little noisy but all the rest was great.
"we chose the 4 course surprise meal with wine arrangement. although the portions were small, they were delicious and very well presented. each course came first with a different wine. although obviously excellent wines, i did feel the glass was just a little under filled, considering the price. the atmosphere was great, very chic and cosy. we booked for 8pm but our table wasnt available until 8:30, so sat outside on the terrace to wait. all-in-all an excellent restaurant, an absolute must-visit when in ouddorp."
i was in ouddorp for a week and i ate at various restaurants around the area.this place is the best in town by far! hands down.
we have been in this restaurant for the second time and had have a very nice eveni 
"we enjoyed a nice early evening at zus. the young team is nice, helpful and very friendly. the food was very nice and the portions are just right. except for the mousse au chocolat: 2 miserably small cornets filled with probably not even a tea- spoon of mousse over a blop of whipped cream. and this for euro 9.50 "
"went here for a saturday evening dinner, we reserved and if we did not we for sure would not have a place to dine here. it is really a very nice place, ambiance and location. just near the city center of ouddorp (well, village actually). anyway we enjoyed a great variety of food, it is tapas but not as small. the desserts are general and normal sized. the food is splitted in cold-warm-starters main and sides. you can make the menu you want and offer it being served in courses or all at once if you want, good choice of wine, open kitchen (nice to look into) and good service. we enjoyed a great dinner with good quality food. people that work here enjoy their job and that is something that does the taste good."
"went here on a saterday evening, made a reservation, good we did because it was a full house. it has a very relaxed feel to it, staff very friendly and they have a great winelist. we enjoyed a 5-course surprise menu, both fish and meat dishes. it is one of those places i would love to go back to more often, if only we would live closer. really recommended, you won‚Äôt be disappointed . "
"we waited for our dish a little bit longer but it totally worth the time. this cozy restaurant left a great impression. friendly hosts, great steak and spare ribs (special mention to the simple but tasty rice i selected as side dish) , good presentation and the dessert omg coconut icecream in half coconut and orange ice cream in the oran "
"we (6 adults and our 3 year old son) were wandering around ouddorp looking for somewhere for an evening meal and we came across this place. it looked busy to which is always a good sign, so we went inside and were greeted & seated immediately. the service from the outset was very very good, very attentive and informative without feeling overpowering and intrusive. we sampled the burgers, lamb chops, chicken and the mixed grill. everyone was really pleased with their individual choices, with the quality and quantity both excelle "
there are several restaurants and food outlets in the centre of ouddorp. this had a little bit more class than most - best seen inside the restaurant despite lots of external table 
"relax atmosphere and uncomplicated service. good food, nicely presented. reasonable prices. early closing hours."
we had a fantastic time in this place and i had the best spare ribs i ever had. even the salmon was delicious .. friendly service..fair prices..we coming back next time..
"we arrived in town too early to check into our hotel. on a sunday, most everything is closed, which we found out when we tried to go to a museum so we parked and walked along the street taking pictures a building from the 1700s. we then saw this restaurant and decided to give it a try. they have an english menu upon request. i ordered a salad that had cheese and nuts that blended well with the vegetables. my husband ordered a burger but wished he had asked for well done. it was fairly rare for his liking but he ate it all anyway. the server was friendly and the restaurant and toilets were very clean. we will likely return if we have time on this trip "
"our original intent was to dine at another location in the beautiful little dutch village of ouddorp, however it was fully booked so we walked the few short streets in town to find an alternati "
"the location is beautiful, very central. they offer a wide variety of pancakes, al that we tried were delicious. the only thing is that the service, although friendly, was very slow. my kid had a sausage and wanted ketchup (i know... ketchup...) by the time he got it everyone had finished eating and of course his food was cold. we each had time for two drinks before we got our food. then wait for the check... it was a crowded thursday afternoon but still, maybe more waiters?"
very nice place with tasty food. it took a bit long to get our lunch but it tasted amazing. recommended!
booked this place up front. very convenient on their website where you could state of you have an allergy or need a child chair. we ordered pancakes and eggs on ham and bread. there is a kids corner and the place is very nicely decorated and very pleasan 
"we booked a table for 10 at 6pm and glad we did as the restaurant was full, as soon as we took our reserved table. the choice of pancakes was bewildering but we eventually found our favourite. we specificaly asked for hot chocolate sauce in a jug to accompany the pancake and icecream, instead the chocolate was drizzleed over the pancake which was not our specification.the buiding dates back to 1774 and the interior has been well preserved. service was swift and pleasant. a good experience to try something typically dutch."
"had a nice lunch here. service was very friendly and fast. liked the sweet pancakes best. the savory ones come with the same batter, unlike a french galet."
"we were driving from amsterdam to belgium via the dutch coast and were looking for somewhere to stop for lunch. ideally we wanted somewhere on the coast but on driving through this pretty village on the way to the coast we decided to stop . the restaurant is in the square and you can either eat inside in old dutch building , out the front or next to the square under the conker trees. as it was a nice day we sat under the trees but we and all the people on the other tables kept having to dodge falling conkers . luckily none actually landed on us or the meals but it made for an entertaining hour . we ordered from the extensive pancake menu and both had the cheese ham and apple ones . they came with thin slices of a apple covered with cheese and pieces of ham . very filling and tasty . overall a good spot for a quick and filling lunch"
we were served very quickly and very friendly. the pancakes were very tasty. we will definitely return here when revisiting ouddorp!
"we had just gone shopping in ouddorp and fancied a wander and something to eat.there, in the middle of town, around the church was a number of places to eat but the smell was drawing my other half in one direction....pannenkoekenhuis de platte hap. as it wasnt the warmest of days we decided to sit indoors and loved the dutch living room atmosphere the place had; many traditional features and decor made the whole place feel welcoming and cosy. in contrast, the stunning and modern bathroom facilities felt very clean and up-mark "
"my family of 5 ordered 5 different pancakes, and they were all so delicious. portions were generous and filling. service was friendly, and as an added bonus, the restaurant has a nice little play/reading area for the little guests. decor and atmosphere was very cozy. prices were on the high side, but when on holiday and the food is good, its a forgivable little flaw."
"we enjoyed eating here a few times. each time we received fantastic, warm service, enjoyed the pleasant traditional and fun surroundings and enjoyed a very nice meal. definitely worth s visit if you are staying in port zealande."
worth a visit for those after proper pannekoeken (pancake 
"excellent food, really delicious. great value for large plates of very tasty traditional dutch lunch food. good service and friendly multilingual staff. brilliant."
"during our 1 week vacation, we ate here 3 times. everything is homemade and tastes just wonderful. when u r in the area and just wanna have a tiny snack, u need to try their homemade apple cake. it is super delicious"
"been in the area for almost a week and easily the best meal we have had since arriving. can‚Äôt fault anything; awesome service, great food, lovely setting, kid friendly and value for money!"
stopped here again recently as the weather was nice enough to sit outside and we remembered our last visit was very nice indee 
"we wandered around ouddorp looking for a nice lunch spot. noticed quite a few locals going in here and followed them in. we were welcomed warmly by the lady behind the till who gave us menus. her english was excellent (thankfully) and she offered to explain things to us. the menu is in dutch and german only do this was much appreciated. the kids had burgers which they loved. the chips were freshly made and hand cut. i had the sate chicken and my husband had the fillet steak (a steal at ‚Ç¨13). it was the nicest steak hes had in years. everything was delicious and the portions are generous. shame that this was the last day of our holiday, we would have returned otherwise!"
"stopped here for a bite to eat on saturday evening. our order was taken by a lovely young lady, very polite and friendly. the dishes chosen were well presented and tasted very nice. her male colleague was also very pleasant and friendly. and in the end the bill was also rather pleasant and friendly :-). so all in all a very nice experience."
what a treat to (try) and select the flavour ice cream you fancy. service was quick and helpful. very reasonable prices and all flavours we tried were delicious!
"whether you are a local or a tourist, you will find a flavour of ice cream you like. the scoops are of a very generous size, so you might want to take it easy on the ordering. that, however, is difficult as we found it very hard to choo "
"friendly staff, quick and good service. food was good. they even had some belgian beers. probably the best chinese restaurant of andijk."
"we ate here 6 adults and a baby. the food is tasty, like old chinese restaurant in the 90s. it was completely empty which was fun. it has a childrens menu and a high chair. it really suited us at the moment, we enjoyed it. oh and we loved the decor."
"this is a great find in the nature park midway between the two center parcs sites. great selection of savoury and sweet pancakes (the blueberry one is stuffed with fruit, my son also loved his apple and cinnamon pancake. great selection of local beer too. closed monday amd tuesdays, friendly staff. if obly it opened for breakfast."
"we visited when staying at a local centre parcs. this restaurant is situated in beautifully bucolic surroundings that teem with butterflies and dragonflies. the pancakes and bitterballen were absolutely delicious, i had the large ‚Äòfarmers‚Äô pancake that included cheese, bacon, onions and mushrooms, my daughters had sweet pancakes, one simple pancake with syrup the other loaded with blueberries. the pancakes are very filling, and reasonably priced, perfect for a break in a long walk or bike ride to take in the wildlife and beautiful countryside the restaurant is set in."
this restaurant serves a selection of delicious pancakes and is very affordable. the most expensive pancake (boerenpannekoek) is only 10.50 eur 
"excellent  food & wine , very friendly service ,   very relaxing  surroundings .perfect place for  families ."
very good starters: fish soup with salmon rolls or ham and melon. very fine italian wine. good choice of excellently cooked/fried fish and meat with al dente cooked vegetabl 
"i went here with my family last week, the atmosphere was great, most tables were booked but there is a good distance between the tables which made it not feel crowded but lively. the food was good for the price (not spectacular, but good food combined with a large variety of beers on the card made it totally worth the buck). a welcome surprise was when we ordered a cheese plate for desert: on the menu this was only available as a snack, the chef came out of the kitchen to ask us if they can make a special configuration of cheeses that go better as a desert vs a snack option. it showed that despite a full house, they are able to tune the menu to specific wishes beyond the menu which i highly value. besides that the owner of the place came to check on us and verified that the cheese plate met our desires. all in all a great experience in a beautiful traditional zeelandish barn-house. i fully recommend this place"
fantastic place for dinner. prices are not too high for the very good quality food and nice wine. staff is very friendly.
really interesting fusion type menu with a very strong slant towards indonesian / malaysian flavours & textures. service is prompt and charmi 
"very nice vibrant location in the center, on a main shopping street, good vibe and atmosphere.  service is friendly. the broodje van de eeuw was disappointing, certainly for the price of ‚Ç¨11,25."
"stopped in for lunch. restaurant was clean with fast, friendly service. our food was good and so many items they were serving look delicious as well. we will eat here again."
"i‚Äôve eaten here twice and my groups have tried multiple menu items. food presentation, quality and variety are excelle "
we enjoyed our lunch with family. great food and good service. value for money. recommrnded to visit!
"we loved the place. the food was good, nice presentation, and the desserts: divine!! i will definitely come back."
"it started with good parking on ‚Äòde markt‚Äô. no fee after 18:00. service was quick in the restaurant, although time between starter and main course could have been quicker. great tournedos from the grill!"
"i have been here several times and the menu is each time amazing. all dishes were full of flavor and well prepared. i like the mix from different latin american dishes and styled, its round and varied, and the wine cart is also very good."
"good atmosphere, spacious, its sitiuated in the same building as the theatre. great food. steak was cooked exactly as i ordered it. lovely first course, not thrilled about the dessert i chose, it was a bit dry, but the others looked great!"
"tasty food, good wines, great service, nice location. we had a fantastic night out with our friends."
"the food, the atmosfeer, the waiters and the music was very good. every saturday there is life music and this restaurant is linked to the theater, so when you go to see a show it is nice to have a lovely diner first in this restaurant."
"we were enthused on arrival at cusco, the greeting was friendly and the d√©cor including lots of twinkly lights was very ni "
"this is the first time we have visited cusco and it wont be the last. my wife spotted it and as we live just down the road took me there for my birthday dinner. its not cheap but the food was excellent, i had the combination nachos to start and they were great! the homemade salsa, melted cheese and nachos were delicious and fresh tasting, and the portion size was just right. washed that down with a good sized glass of white wine. had the ribeye for main and that was cooked to perfection. washed that down with a wonderful malbec.for desert i chose the churos with a condensed milk dip and vanilla ice-cream. wonderful!. another great restaurant in this surprisingly foodie town"
"my new favourite place! take the best service and care you can imagine, add excellent food from the tapas menu, and count in nice, calming atmosphere. on top of that, a good selection of beverages. i will definitely make sure to come back whenever im in the area. not only that, i will make a detour if needed. "
"brilliant restaurant, great food especially the schnitzel and the burgers looked great too - the double burger was actually 2 burgers not 2 layers on meat ...... you will certainly come away from this place full and very happy with your choice  great staff too"
"we went for the tapas option and had a fantastic night out.  the food was tasty, service good and super friendly, prices are reasonable. we didnt experience the slow service as mentioned by others.   all together a great night out and well be back soon"
fantastic food - friendly sta 
"good food. good choices. good starters, like bruchetta. nice seats insite. and also a big terrace outside with heating lamps."
"although menu is not too long, but food was very tasty. enjoyed grilled catch of the day that was well balanced, nicely served and ver tasty.  nice service, spacious place.  overall is a good value for money."
"had lunch and liked it. food was tasty, staff friendly and the food was presented in a colourful inventive way.   would certainly return and recommend to others."
"right 8n the centre of uden on the top floor of the classy and well known department store ‚Äú hout brox‚Äù, this is great for a stylish sandwich or salad for lunch. the service is excellent and the prices reasonable with new dishes not on the menu every month."
more a caf√© than a brasserie as the hot food selection is limited. good for a lunch break rather than a long dinner. however food freshly prepared and good quality. never would have found it without tripadvisor reviews as on top floor of hout brox department store. roof terrace sitting if weather permits. normally closes at 6pm but open until 9pm on fridays with greater menu selection.
"on top of the hout brox fashion house is a hidden gem. food is great, lots of choice. atmosphere is good, the roof terrace is amazing if the sun is shinin "
"food is top quality, lot of originality in the selection of the day. perfect for a fast brunch as well as a proper environment for a business lunch."
"de conversatie, located on the top floor of the large store hout-brox in udens lively town center, will surprise you with the quality of food, drinks and especially the staff serving you. for dutch standards the ladies are extremely friendl "
even on a mondayafternoon this place is full. a very smart concept in a clothesstore. with fresh products included the dishes were lovely. we were sitting next to the windows and had a great view and the sun coming in. great experience.
"a different kind of high tea, with only products from around uden. also tea from a carrousel (not with tea bags) and it all looks and tastes very good! a nice atmosphere and good service."
"we stayed at the brasserie during a visiting travel on gen 2015 . we were a group of 15 farmers/educators from italy, and everybody liked the food and the the atmosphere !! keep it up!"
visited this restaurant for lunch and really enjoyed the ambiance. the staff were lovel 
"been there a few times already, trendy beautiful place with nice atmosphere and view over the centre of uden, food is always perfect and service as well!"
"we have been using this restaurant for many years,both when we lived in uden and now, when we visit from the uk. the design and layout of this eatery has changed and been improved over the years and recently extended. the restaurant is often busy and bustling and at lunchtimes it is a good idea to reserve a table as it is usually full of enthusiastic regular customers! the menu offers a reasonably diverse selection of dishes without being too ambitious with what the kitchen can sensibly cope with and provide. this allows the kitchen to really concentrate on getting all the items on the menu just right. in our experience, if there are any discrepancies with the food served, the staff quickly and efficiently rectify any problems. in fact,the expertise and polite professionalism of the staff is one of the main reasons we continue to patronise this establishment! we should also mention the very attractive and creative floral displays which decorate the restaurant. we look forward to eating here on our next visit to uden."

"excellent front of house. personable friendly but professional service throughout. food interesting enough and well cooked enough to deserve a michelin star. wine match interesting and fine, but seemed to try to be different above being spot on (sometimes the classic matches shouldn‚Äôt be ignored "
"what a nice place. in uden a small city near nijmegen we enjoyed a lovely evening out. excellent wines and excellent diner, their michelin star earned well"
"we had dinner with friends and had a great evening! the ambiance was very relaxed and informal, the staff was very friendly and the food and wine were delicious. we had the sommelier menu where food was prepared to pair with a specific wine. delicious food and wines and very original approach! we live about 150km from here and will plan to come back again."
"very surprising menu, perfect in balance, good wines. the restaurant, situaties in the center of uden, is style bert trendy and you feel at home right away. young and enthusiastic team!"
"i ate here when on a business trip to the netherlands, as with nearly all the restaurants i have visited in the netherlands the food ad service were lovely. the decor is modern and the place is relaxing with superb staff who spoke perfect english and were happy to explain the dishes to me. i had 3 courses and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here. i would definitely return here if in the area, and can highly recommend this place."
"the restaurant, situated in the center of uden, is styled very trendy and you feel at home right away. we have been enjoying the 5-course menu including wine pairing. at each course, we were again surprised by beautiful ingredients and combinations. a young, enthusiastic team explained the different dishes. also a big compliment to the sommelier, the wines were not obvious but all matched with the dishes. thanks to the whole team for a beautiful evening."
"fantastic food, beautifully prepared by a great young team. best fois gras appetizer i had in a long time. oysters and fish super fresh on a tuesd "
"took a very discerning out of town guest here from paris, and we all enjoyed it. lovely smart casual dining- excellent food, service, wine, with that nice mixture of friendly relaxation and everything done right. will definitely go again. i had the vegetarian menu, something very hard to find in fine dining restaurants. "
if youve ever thought about michelen star dining but didnt have a wallet to fit then do not despair. onivoo will deliver the experience for you. and you will have change. thijs and his team delivered spectacular dishes and the presentation was a true art form. they have an inspiring website and the impression that it leaves you is not an exaggeration. those dishes as photographed are exactly what you can expec

"amazing dinner!! besides a superb main course and a great dessert, we also got a lot of small dishes in between to die for.. i can truly recommend this restaurant!!"
worth every penny!! amazing service!! staff very service minded . good prices for the kind of food and dishes you get
"was here for an inspection job in oss with one colleague. decided to go for the top restaurant in uden. we were not disappointed. we took the 4-course menu. good food, prepared with local and fresh ingredients. wines from the arrangement matched very well with the food and were of good quality. the seating and atmosphere is above average. the waiting between the courses was quiet long - a bit too long in our opinion."
everything was freshly prepared.  the food was delicious and wind menu equally good.  great service and amuse bouche and petit fours with coffee equally amazing
"cosy, quiet, nice atmosphere. good for business but also family dinner.   very good service.  food is nice, absolutely more than average dutch food !!  i would go back !  food 8/10 place 8/10 service 8/10"
"we are frequent visitors to the raadhuis in uden. this was our 8th visit in four years. after its take over by another headchef last year inity they struggled a bit but after last week we are totally hooked on raadhuis again. we choose the excellent value for money special menu. 55 euros each including accompanying wines (but excluding water 6 euros a liter, fizzy or flat "
very delicious food in a cosy and central setting. between the courses we where served little very nice bites. recommendable!
"very good service, very nice menu for the price you pay! dont hesitate, this is probably the best restaurant in uden!"
the service from the staff is 100%. friendly people and a very good kitchen. try it u are never disappointed.
owner/chef rob van de velden did not go with every new trend but has maintained his high level of quality over the years. hospitality must be the middel name of his sommelier. excellent food and excellent pricing!
"for a very important business meeting we were inviting the members of our board of directors for the first time. we had looked for a location with the right atmosphere and found raadhuis in uden. this was such a good decision. the dinner was memorable for all of us - the food was wonderful, the service spot on - we hope to come back again soon!"
"family gathering with 17 started with a private meeting in a separate room and welcome drink followed by a wonderful meal in the large private function / dining room. beautifully presented 6 course meal and wine, staff very attentive and even asked individuals about their allergies or preferences, nice portions and gaps between each servin "
"i just enjoyed one the the best meal that i have ever eaten in the netherlands (or anywhere else). the service was attentive yet unobtrusive, the wine was good for the price and the food was superb. i had the duck with goose liver to start and the dover sole as the main course. both dishes were best in class. the prices are in line with the quality of the food and service and i will visit het raadhuis if i ever stay in uden again."
"we had lunch here with some friends and really enjoyed it. i had the sandwich of the house (euro 7,40) and it tasted excellent. in combination with some good and friendly service this is a 5 star for me. i can definitely recommend going here."
probably the best ice cream shop in town. amazing ice cream and enough place to sit to enjoy your ice cream. well done.
"gorgeous ice cream with a good selection of different flavours. we went in here and they were extremely friendly, spoke good english (better than our dutch!) and helped us translate some of the flavours. the kids throughly enjoyed their ice cream and my husband recommends dolce latte flavour though he didnt get to see much of it with the little one!"
"there are 2 great places to enjoy a good icecream, this is one of them, the other one is bananas, you cant go wrong to chosse this one :-)"
a wide range of flavors (94). they experiment with new flavors all the time and the guest is often surprised with something n 
"if your looking for a run of the mill ice cream cone, dont come here! but my friends, if you are looking for an ice cream extravaganza then this is the place to be! located near the heart of uden this shoppe makes all their own ice creams, ice yogourts and ice milks as well as a darn good cup of tea or coffee. enjoy your iced treats in the peaceful shade under an ancient tree with other grownups remembering their childhood years."
"great franchise that started in uden and already has 28 restaurants. nice ambiance, friendly staff and a great selection of tapas. not your avarage all you can eat. quality over quantity."
we had a great dinner here. it‚Äôs all you can eat for 30‚Ç¨ and kids for 7‚Ç¨. incredible value for the amount of food and quality you get! drinks are typical prices! staff was friendly and many spoke english! highly recommend!
"this is an all you can eat tapas restaurant with a broad menu that did not disappoint. i have been here twice with a group of 8-12. the staff was very friendly and they were able to provide menus in english and most spoke english too. the food will keep coming as long as you write down what you want, so make sure you are ready. even with the wide variety of food on the menu, it was fresh, hot and flavorful. make sure to call ahead for a reservation, because they stay busy. overall, this was a great place to enjoy a meal!!"
"this place is great, proven by the fact it was full to the rafters....on a monday night !!! a tapas restaurant with a great concept. you pay a set amount per person and get a bundle of lists, on which you can mark the dishes (2 p,p. per round) you would like, for as many rounds as you like. and all the dishes we had were very very good. the atmosphere was very warm and homely and the staff were very well mannered, pleasant, friendly and hard working. delightful  "
this restaurant was recommended by local people as one to be famous from good food and interesting form of serving. and indeed it was quite interesting - quests are chosing small tapas several rounds so there is possibility to try many of dishes. servis was a bit slow but maybe it was because we were quite a big group. and once going out with big group - watch out! someone may steal your order ;)
"i have been here a few times before, but every time i still love the concept. so many options for anybody. we had two persons with a special wish for food: lactose free and no meat. and still, also for them there was more than enough. the service was great. manon was doing a very good job. she just started working there and used a lot of humor which we could really appreciate."
nice cozy restaurant with great food. interior looks are cool! i enjoyed an affordable and tasteful meal!
"very good burgers, friendly service, accepted visa card, clean restrooms. kids play area on one side of the restaurant. no english menu available, but staff was helpful answering questions. many cute novelty items for sale in the restaurant. we will definitely come back."
"we enjoyed our stay at the restaurant de belhamel. it was a very nice place with a nice view to the canal. the boeuf belhamel was very tender and the cheesecake delicious. the service was very kind and the restaurant is dog friendly, which is quite rare in amsterdam ( we always travel with our little jack russel) "
"we had the seasonal menu, the main menu was a bit pricey for what we were looking to pay on this particular trip. the food was delicious, the service was great and the atmosphere suits. this was one of the best meals we have had outside of a michelin restaurant, thoroughly enjoyed it. if you are on a bit of a budget, check that you like the seasonal menu on their website before you go."
"this wonderful little restaurant is located right where one canal t-bones another. at outdoor seating or in the restaurant itself, you can look straight down the one canal (at sunset its stunning) and be delightfully amused by boat traffic on both canals jousting at the intersection. and the cuisine matches the view. it has a french-bistro touch, with dutch food sourcing. on last visit, my wife and i opted for seafood completely. our seafood plate shared appetizer included lobster, shrimp, smoked eel spread and more. entrees were a generous portion of sauteed red snapper with whole, fresh carrots, potatoes and beets, and a deliciously poached serving of salmon on a puree of root vegetables. wine list is well represented, with pairings suggested on the menu. we lingered as long as we could with dessert wine just to watch boats glide by as dusk fell . . . more than a bit romantic!"
visited this charming little place together with my son to have lun 
"baarle nassau, always a nice town to go  "
"we opted for two hours which was more than enough, and was for both food and drinks, soft or alcoholic. loads of choice from chinese, thai, european already pre-prepared, plus an option to have your choice of fish or steak etc cooked to your liking in front of you. great dessert choice too!"
me family and friends are regulars here and we love the place. overall the food is great. the options are there and you can eat everything chinese food has on offer in here. it‚Äôs kids friendly and the staff are great
"it is the type of restaurant where you eat all you can. you pay a fee at the entrance and then everything you want to eat and drink is free. the food is very well prepared and you can choose also for wok or teppanyaki. they have a lot of choices. the staff is very friendly and they speak english, if you dont know dutch. "
"the price is quite cheap since you can drink for free . and the food is tasty,especially the beefsteak."
"la pergola is the only authentic italian restaurant in baarle-nassau. located on the chaamseweg, this is where to go if you want a tasty italian pizza. dont be mistaken by the cheap takeaway across the street. la pergola sits hidden in the back of a driveway, right behind a french restauran "
nice pancake house with 200+ types of pancakes available! staff is kind and there is care for details.
belgian waffle with strawberries was outstanding. calm location with a beautiful view on the two nearby churches
"if you love pancakes, this is your place. the service is fast with lot of choice. the restaurant is big and theres enough place in the terrace. but they do not have a menu on a different language.. only dutch !!"
"despite the core of the place are children, please do not be confused. it is not noisy and caotic. quite the oposite. is organised and the paste of the food is exelent. it has a wide variety of options and certanly you with or witout children will enjoy."
they had an enormous menu and i loved the pancakes. great hot chocolate too. the kitchen had just started up so the pancakes took a while to come but thats only because it wasnt lunch time yet. dont think you typically come in the morning for food but not too sure. it was fine though and good service. great atmosphere and lovely place. 
we came for the restaurant between the boarders but find this place. te staff was welcoming and very helpful. the food was amazing we took the greek and it was very good. the coffe was good too and the kids enjoyed the pancakes. they have kids play ro 
perfect as well as worth it place to visit with your family. provides a wide range of options for pancakes. kids are welcome to visit with a nice spot to play as well as get a gift. yum-yum packages will entertain your kids while you enjoying the foods.
"i was staying in baarle for a couple days and noticed that this place was more than just a breakfast spot. its in a perfect spot in the center of town! i sat down for dinner on the sidewalk and ordered a pizza pancake, which tasted just like a regular pizza!"
"of youre in baarle and youre hungry, go eat here. one of these will fill you right up. you can get a hearty pancake or some sweet one. there is also a room for the kids to play in. staff is very friendly."
"this restaurant is well worth it. they probably 100 pancakes, if not more, to choose out of. its very hard to make a decision "
"very nice restaurant, in small town. excellent atmosphere, cosy, good menu card. owner is very friendly and you feel at home at once."
"typical example of dutch gezellig, intimate. great service, nice food, recommended have been there a couple of times and will surely comeback."
we spotted it one day while on a bike ride to emmerlich and thought it looked nice. a couple of days later we were close and looking for a lunch stop so it was obvious to go ther 
"old village inn, nice building with old charm, friendly staff and prevenant. about meal, quickly served. about quality, the meal is dutch, typically dutch. being french people we cant judge. it was different but it was still good."
"we were sent here by our b&b hosts in nearby k√ªbaard. a pleasant country restaurant in a small village, obviously frequented by a lot of locals. we enjoyed the warm evening and lonf twilight outside. the lady serving us was of the senior staff, very friendly, and gave us good advice what to choose. the food was superb, the meat and fishcooked exactly as wished, but i must single out the french fries which were a dream! the best ones i ate on this long nw europe trip including belgium! highly recommended, worth a larger detour if in the provice of friesland!"
this place - depsite being relatively close to two moterways - is very tranquil and nicely situated on the waterfront. loads of activieties are organisaed closeby and the restaurant serves nice food and has really friendly staff.
we took a turn from the highway a50 and stopped at seeing the outside of watergoed. the parking area was secured and after entrance we sat down on the nice terrace in the many nice shadow spots. we drunk a local non alcoholic beer and ate a hamburger and a club sandwich which tasted very nice. the staff(very friendly and nice ladies üòâ) provided friendly service and were very patie 
"one of my favourites in the northern groningen area, this family-owned restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem for food lovers. small, intimate, and friendly, veldzicht serves excellent food using classic but often-overlooked ingredients (such as some rarely seen varieties of more well-known vegetables), mostly locally produced and all lovingly prepared. i have never regretted dining there, although there have been times ive regretted *not* dining there."
"we were a group of 14 travelers who unexpectedly needed a place at the last minute for lunch. our tour group leader checked trip advisor and called the owner of veldzicht and inquired about the possibility of bringing 14 tired and hungry travelers for lunch in a few hours and our leader had a limited budget. the owner was amazing! when we got to the restaurant, our group was greeted enthusiastically and the food was delicious! he had prepared a delicious steak, cooked to each persons taste, a fresh tasty salad and bowls of crisp french fries. we had our choice of drinks, beer, wine, etc. and a chocolate covered ice cream bar for dessert. he even provided a vegetarian option for 2 of our travelers. this is a family friendly restaurant, immaculate and comfortable with a small play area outside for children. we had just completed a river cruise and had fabulous meals for 2 weeks but i must say we all agreed that the lunch we were served rivaled any of the meals that had been served on our ship!"
"came as a family of four with two teenage kids. service was very good, food excellent, atmosphere very nice indeed. sometimes not many people are in and it is alittle flat. my only other comment is i only would like the owner (wife) to be a little more engaging with guest "
lovely cafe. we had lunch. terrific!! even glutenfree bread. friendly welcome aswell.  a nice feeling we got from this place.
"the restaurant is situated in the center of the picturesque village beusichem, 50 meters from the 14th century church. a great place to sit at the front or back terrace enjoying your drinks and a selection of their lunch or dinner menu with friends and family."
"in the centre of the small village beusichem, opposite to the church at the market plain, restaurant het heerenlogement is situated. from the former centuries it was an inn, amd styill it kept its hospitality. besides the dinner area it has two special rooms extra for small groups up to 12 persons, the menu is not large but has enough offers to get a good dinner served for every taste for normal prices. the service is great. this restaurant owns a theater which is used for artists. there are nice combinations with a performance and a buffet."
"situated in a beautiful historical village and building. f riendly staff, great price-quality dishes and wines."
"great service, a nice terrace outside to sit and enjoy a drink or something to eat. we had lunch salmon tartare broodje and i had the buffalo chicken broodje. very enjoyable."
caf√© middeloo is a nice place for a coffee or a lunch. you can eat a nice sat√© or a salade (and more). also they have a nice terras outside! great for a glass of wine at happy hour!
this place has the looks and feel of a real dutch bar. youll feel quite at ho

nice location with comfortable seating on the terrace. very good service with friendly staff. food served was delicious for both of us. would certainly recommend this restaurant for lunch or evening meal.
"broad varity of great pancakes, if you like you can also pick the toppings on your own. child- and dog-friendly. bit remote location but that is perfectly fine."
we had a family holiday in medemblik when we realized that it was the day the terraces were reopen 
they offer a wide variety of pancakes! you can also choose and combine different toppings on top of your natural pancake. the food are really delicious! the staff are also friendly and attentive. plus they give your little ones a surprise gift before leaving. highly recommended!

"since we were on our way back home from vacation, we wanted to eat one last pannenkoeken.  due to tripadvisor we picked this place.  the servants were friendly and quick.  our pannenkoeken were great! definitely a place to go."
"the best ramen in the netherlands! i love the tsukamen dipping style noodles, which take advantage of the delicious homemade noodles."
"visited yokohama ramen saito early june 2022. there was a short waiting time before we got seated, but it was not too long! we sat by the bar overlooking the busy kitchen. it was great seeing the whole staff in action. the food itself was authentic, full of bold flavors. with just one slurp of the noodles it brought me back straight to japan. we tried the salty and miso ramens, both absolutely delicious! it is well worth the trip to experience such amazing food!"
"we wanted to visit an authentic ramen serving restaurant, and search engines suggests this on "
"the very lovely waitress tells you everything you need to know about ramen, then you get a absolutely filling portion when ordering ‚Äûmedium‚Äú, you have to be veery hungry to go for the ‚Äûbig‚Äú. very tasty, quite hard to eat for a first-timer though, so don‚Äôt wear your best shirt may "
"literally the best ramen i‚Äôve ever tried. the staff is very nice, the food is just perfect. be careful, there‚Äôs always a lot of people and you could be waiting outside ‚ò∫Ô∏è. will definitely come again !"
"very surprised by this unique (in the netherlands) ramen store! had a very nice authentic tasting ramen, which really made me happy! the prices are low too! maybe even too low in my opinion! i hope i will get the chance to return soon!"
we love this place which is so simple and keeps true to the important things. homemade noodles made with the heart and served with a smile. also the tantan soup is a life saver for when getting a cold.  our favorite place in schiedam!!!
"the restaurant interior is basic, canteen/family style. the ramen are fresh and delicious. had tantanmen and its the best noodles i ever had in the netherlands. my friend had miso and that broth was perfect too! excellent service. does not serve alcohol but the 0% heineken was ok."
"for those people who have critic regarding this shop, you can lowest price ramen with deep broth that you cannot get at other ramen shop. he charges drinks 1.50 euro .. that is almost nothing compared to other shop who charges 2.75 .. if you have appreciation what he does, then you will enjoy his food more."
i usually come here at least 3/4 times a month with my bro 
"the ramen is the best in the rotterdam area. the restaurant is very casual, family style. good service, friendly staff and very good quality at low pricing."
"we went here on a recommendation from a friend. when we entered, the place was packed, and we were greeted but nobody told us what to do. we had to find out ourselves that we had to wait for a space to open up, and about 45 minutes later, it did. we had to sit together with other people, which was strange but not disruptiv "
"this is a very simple restaurant with no frills, which makes it an all the more interesting experience that its food is amazingly tasty and generous. we went in on a friday night and there was a line of people waiting. when we finally got a table we had some of the best ramen we ever had, at an amazing price."
"i come here every week, its my favorite place for ramen. you can customize your own ramen, more or less sauce, oil, or add more toppings. broth is delicious and noodles are home made of local ingredients. and with the price of only 9 euro you keep coming back to this place."
the ramen was sooooo tasty! we liked the broth and soft handmade noodles. we would really recommend you to go visit this ramen shop. the owner is so sweet nice cute and kind! üôèüèΩ
"i live in rotterdam but i‚Äôve been to schiedam especially to eat there more than once because it‚Äôs soooo good ! the miso soup is to die for, the broth is simply amazing! it‚Äôs a small restaurant and very good so you might have to wait for a table but it‚Äôs worth it ! the chef and the waiters/waitresses are also super nice ! "
love the food ‚ù§Ô∏è very authentic and great care is put into the cooking üçú!! come here very often with various friends and everyone has enjoyed the ramen and gyoza =] and also love the super friendly waitors and owner n_n! definitely a recommendation to come eat here!
authentic japane 
"we had the miso and soya ramen. the broth was so hearty and delicious. just the correct amount of everything. amazing unami. ramen itself is home made from local ingredients. the flavour is totally different from both. would definately come back. we went at 18.00. left at 19.00, there was a que of about 10 people when we left. the picture doesnt presents the dish well."
"love this place. i come here weekly or sometimes 2 per week! owner and personnel are very friendly!    they dont take reservations, just stop by and order your favorite ramen. highly highly recommend!"
great story on a true japanese speciality that settled in schiedam. authentic ramen noodles is what they serve and if you like this you should go here! the noodles themselves are made by schiedam produces flower which gives the story even more authenticity. i always take the miso! mind you there are more people that know about this so chances are you will have to wait for your table.
"came here with my friend on the day where everyone weares swim clothing (bikinis etc). felt comfortable, relaxed and safe aka no creeps over there. really great saunas and indoor pool. awesome day to just chill and talk with friends. food here is allright, but it is pricy. our entree was free( they sometimes have actions were you can go in for free, you only pay a swimwear fee of almost 9 euros)"
"really enjoyed this place. friendly staff, clean with lots of options. i would go back if im in the area."
"i visit this spa quite often, because it is close to my home (town). its well-maintained, clean and modern and you can choose from a lot of different saunas. there are some baths (apart from the larger swimming pool inside), but it would be great if there could be some more (hot tubs for instance). friendly staff. good food at the restaurant (salads are great). great garden."
i have had several lovely days here. the facilities are very good and also the card.  clean place and friendly stuff.
"i have visited this spa recently with the holiday deal 2 for 1. with the coupon (from their website), it is quite good in price (about 15‚Ç¨ p.p "
you can eat in this restaurant only when visiting sauna thermen holid 
"we have been to this spa as a couple and enjoyed it! the spa itself was quite new, probably renovated lately. they just forgot to renovate the 2 small pools outside.. i hope that this will be done as well soon, if so, i would make it a 5 star spa. the prizes are actually quite high, but for the netherlands and a spa this seems quite normal "
"we were in rotterdam in march, brrrrrr. so we went to the sauna in schiedam, very easy to reach by train from rotterdam central station. we spent a lovely evening going from sauna to sauna, trying the different atmospheres and bathing outside in a warm water pool while there was a snowstorm going on, that was great! the location is typical for many big saunas in holland: wedged between highways in an industrial zone but thats ok. tip: we arrived after 5 pm so the entry price was more than halved and thus very reasonable. tip: take your own gear (flip flops, towels and bathrobes) we did not try the restaurant. you should be at ease with being in the nude..."
"the saunas are great, lots of choice, the loly fanatstic but i dont understand why all the sauna-complexes in the netherlands have gone up in price lately "
it was a very pleasant restaurant and my friend was looking forward to trying thai food for the first time. the food was very good and the service was pleasant. the hardest thing was to choose what to eat as everything sounded good.
"nice small restaurant. owner and chef are friendly and welcoming. i had my normal thom kha kia and pad gapraow kai. they were both really good. not so spicy as normal, but good flavours."
i went to have dinner with my boyfriend and everything was really tasty and delicious. he ate duck and i ate prawns with red curry sauce. the food was so good that you could imagine yourself in thailand. i have been in several thai restaurants but i have to say that this is the best one i have ever tried in the netherlands. the waiter was really kind. we were talking to him and he was really nice explaining us from where the food come and the history of the restaurant. i strongly recommend this restaurant so if you are in schiedam it is worth going there to enjoy a delicious meal.
"we had dinner here last week. first time with new owners somchai and markus. we felt as if we were back in thailand, the chef prepared my favorite dish (nua nam tok) and we had several starters and khao pad. some of the dishes were cheaper than before, which was also a pleasant surprise. the taste of our dishes was just lovely and the nua nam tok was spicy like it should be üòä. will go back soon!! "
"very fresh and good thai food and good service.  the location is not the best,  but that is not most important.  very calm place.  maybe more people in the weekends."
great friendly service. took a while to choose what we wanted as there were so many options. our meals were delicious. lots of fresh veges and good sized portions. one of the best thai experiences i had out of thailand.
"with seven people nicely seated in the middle of the restaurant. food is good value for money, service of the crew friendly. good to find out they had juliper bier on draft ! next opportunity will return."
"i eat here regularly. the food is excellent. the vegetables are freshly cooked and just right. the staff is very friendly. i even brought some friends here who go to thailand often and they even ordered what was not on the menu, but no problem for them to prepare it."
"i have been to this restaurant several times for both dine in and takeaway orders, i have to say that this restaurant serves the best thai food i have ever tasted. the owner nui and his staff are warm and friendly and their attention to detail is second to no "
lovely building. very helpful staff and excellent food. the waitress was so helpful and explained points of interest and the menu to us.
"fascinating building (and yes, it is on a slant inside, its not you) now a library with fast free wifi, great service and a good selection of snacks, pastries, stronger drinks and fab coffee."
we stumbled across this place by accident as part of a sightseeing walk around schiedam. its a small caf√© as part of the main public library where you can sit inside and read whats on offer in the library or take a seat at a table outside. it was a very hot day so we took advantage of the outdoor seati 
"visiting this restaurant you will discover that cheape is not allways bat. in a more family like surrounding you can eat all kind off realy chinese food for a good price. don`t expect the most beautifull place but the food, service en kindness of the staff will surprise you. and believe me, we visit this restaurant allready for manny years."
"excellent italian restaurant, pizza with genuine ingredients. the owners are italian and cook very well, they are very kind. the dishes are real italian, with no dutch or touristic influences!"
very good and very professional! a very good place where have a nice meal with fresh recepies in the heart of schiedam
we had a warm welcome and we had a good dinner last friday. everyone in the company enjoyed their meal. i certainly want to go back when i go back to schiedam.
we ate here a few times whilst in schiedam for a business trip. it was exactly what we were looking for - good food for a reasonable price. the service was friendly and there was a nice atmosphere outside with views on to the square.
"every guest is welcomed by the owner, a nice and friendly person, i a way that you feel at home immediatly. the dishes are all very tastefull."
"we sat down at the terrace with the sun setting, looking for a nice dinne "
"dropped in for a spot of lunch and found an amazing italian. some of the best italian food ever had, despite living in milan for 10 years. very reasonable prices, fantastic service and a real passion form the owners to serve you great food with an open armed italian welcome. will be a regular now! thanks for a lovely welcome and fantastic food. "
"ive now dined here numerous times. a very simple restaurant, more cafe like at times but located overlooking one of the nicest parts of schiedam. the menu is simple but provides a good range of pasta and pizza. the recent addition of alcohol has certainly added to the appeal with italian beers and wines now available. dining is best outside people watching the beautiful square. upstairs is not so pleasant but downstairs allows you to see the wonderful owner organise her staff. the service can be a little slow at times but is always friendly. and the food is fabulous. fantastic pizzas and pasta. proper home style cooking full of flavour and at very reasonable prices. my favourite place to eat in schiedam for a relaxed, flavourful and friendly meal. grazie mille. "
"after i left italy it was hard to find a real good italian restaurant in the netherlands. cotto e mangiato is a rare place where you can get a real italian food, great quality and fine prices."
"very recommendable italian restaurant, we had a dinner and we ordered different types of pizzas. the ingredients were very tasty and the dough well cooked! to drink, they have a variety of natural juices which are very recommendable too."
cotto en mangiato is a combination of deli and (lunch)restaurant. i have lunch here regular 
tasty food great serv 
"it was $22.50 for each one, little expensive but worth it. the food was delicious, the menu has different choices for the tapas even for vegetarians. i will come back for sure!"
i enjoyed my meal at curry corn 
looking for some nice food and came across this restaurant whilst walking. the food was very good. very tasty and more than generous portions. service was also excellent. definitely worth a visit if you happen to be on the area.
"i have already been here a few times and i have never been disappointed, best dal eve and best indian restaurant in all of the netherlands if you ask me!"
was a nice experience to be here. very good service and food. the restaurant flair and music make a good harmonious impression.
"delivered right on time, the flavours were really good. all tasted very well, and with plenty of variety. compliment to the chef!"
"nice restaurant, very friendly people. nice food. very tasty, original, fresh what i can say go there and enjoy"
really great food!! loved the service! one of the best indian food restaurants! the chicken tikka masala is must have!
"as an english guy brought up on a diet of curry, this small restaurant made a good impression. the rogan josh was spicy & tangy with a tasty tomato sauce; the nan bread was hot and fluffy and the basmati rice wasnt a sticky gloop. my brother-in-laws madras was good and hot in a rich sauce and the lamb was good quality (though not very much of i "
"i bought a groupon voucher for a set menu in schiedam, near rotterd "
went there several times before with friend and the food is very go 
"having been slightly dubious about the potential quality of what appears to be schiedams only indian restaurant, i can confidentially say ive found a new regular haunt. a large group of us arrived at 9pm on a tuesday evening to a very quiet restaurant. a warm welcome from what presumably was the owner lead to us all being seated around a long table central to the spacious restaurant. the menu is very typical for most indian restaurants around the world, following a lot of anglo-indian conventions. even the indian lager brewed in the midlands (of england) leant itself to the british indian restaurant feel. a variety of dishes were ordered from byriani to dopiaza to jalfrezi. the food arrived and provoked much promise from the aromas that greeted us. much satisfied eating ensued and we all agreed that a return visit would most definitely be arranged. the service was relaxed but friendly and the waiter/owner was very accommodating. my request for chapati resulted in the provision of some roti that wasnt on the menu but quickly produced. a return visit the following week produced a similarly positive experience added to by the very charming waitress. "
"we were here via an invitation from an indian family member. the tandoori chicken was cooked in perfection, tender, juicy and yummy! i personally enjoyed the lamb curry dish too, the taste lingers in my mouth. afterall the kitchen did a very good job in mastering the exotic indian flavours, however the service could be improved. due to the shortage of waitress, we had to wait quite long for the service. "
"i went here with my mother a couple of months ago. rather than us each picking one dish, we had some soup and shared a variety of side dishes and rice. it was very tast "
we visited to tour the windmill and we had a slice of delicous apple pie and coffee. the tour was very informative and the pie was delicious! the fields surrounding the area was beautiful. it had just stopped raining and the sun was begining to shine and everything was still wet...otherwise i would have loved to sit outside at the cute tables on the terrace...i could just imagine spending an afternoon sitting out there sipping coffee and reading a good book! lovely setting and i loved learning about the history of the windmill and how the wooden mechanisms work! fascinating!
every year i go back to this restaurant. it has a wonderful terrace with a beautiful view. you may see some storks if you are lucky. the windmill is amazing to 
this was a very nice stop in a beautiful area. we came on the bikes and ordered croquettes with bread etc. an afflingen and a wiecks rose and we were very happy and satisfied.
"i enjoyed both lunch and dinner at this restaurant. the service was excellent, and the food very good. the salads were large, and the salmon with the famous dutch asparagus delicious. we dined outside on the large terrace. the view is wonderful! i even spotted two stork "
"we stayed close in millingen and found this restaurant during the trip there and decided to eat here.  very cosy modern restaurant and friendly staff.  food, drinks and coffee were very good."
this very beautiful restaurant in the middle of wide landscape flatland of the ooij polderpop serves a nice variaty of breakfasts and lunch 
"this restaurant has improved greatly since its opening a few years ago. i enjoyed several lunches outside on the large terrace. the first time i enjoyed a hamburger, and the second time i ordered the vitello tonnato on home made bread. the portions were large and the food delicious. the service was fast and friendly. i will return to this restaurant. i love the setting, the view and the food! "
"walking from the hampshire hotel in berg en dal along the duivelsberg to persingen en zyfflich and return we took a little lunch at this amazing pretty place. it was a sunny day so we found a table on the cosy terrace with view over the fields and hills of berg en dal and reichswald. 5/5. we choose the calamaris 5/5, apple pie with cream 4/5, hot chocolate with cream 4/5. the service was friendly and efficient 5/5. price performance 5/5. a good place to relax and the menu looked very inviting for a dinner too."
"nice view, easy to get to by car or bike.  the sandwiches are very dutch and are good.  the asparagus soup is the best i ever had."
burger and ribs me and my friend had food was lovely and it in a beautiful location i would defo call for food here again
good quality fastfood like fries etc. much better then the average fastfood chain. also good sandwiches if you want something more healty.
"it is not far from the spots we visited, the old cityhall and the church. few steps away youll be there.  food were good and the place is cozy, clean and with friendly staff."
"on a rainy summer sunday we visited the lovely village of de rijp and found ourselves hungry and looking at this place. we had already decided we wanted pancakes (proper dutch ones, that is, not crepes) and had been prepared to drive away from de rijp for that. we entered and sat ourselves down and ordered pancakes of various varieties, including with bacon and with apple (spekpannekoek, appelpannekoek). they even catered for one of the five of us who wanted a appelspekpannekoek which wasnt on the menu. our pancakes arrived and we truly enjoyed them. tasting as they used to, not a microwave in sight of course. the right balance between crispiness and soft, with good amounts of filling (whether bacon, apple or both). service was quick (but not too quick, you cannot hurry a pancake) and very friendly. good memories. better than most other pancakes i have had in the past few years."
"the restaurant is simple but effective. the service is friendly, fast and personal.if you are in de rijp and readyfor lunch, this is the place to go. the sandwich with old beemster cheese should not be missed. take away is possible and the have free wifi."
over the last weeks i visited inkies twice and on both occassions the quality of the 3 course dinner was excellent. definitely worthwhile to travel a bit further
"we were truly positively surprised on the quality of the food and the service. some small improvements are possible but for us close to 5 star. restaurant is by far best we have visited around the leek area. nice ambianve and terrace, great on a warm day. we will be back"
just moved to this area from eindhoven and started exploring local gems. located at the oude baan scenic bike route through fore 
"together with our daughter in law and grandson we opted for this restaurant, we know it from the past and it is on a reasonable distant from our and their residen "
we always enjoy eating at the stationskoffiehuis. the staff is very friendly and the food is good! besides it is always good to meet friends and enjoy the place outside.
the food here is excellent . they were exceptionally accommodating towards the children .  staff were friendly and efficient and could explain everything to us in english .  top quality food.  we will be back
a special evening with a walking dinner for 50 people. we loved the glaze on the bavette. simple dishes well prepared. next time we will try the menu.
this is a no frills eating house with very good food. the steak i had was the best i have eaten on the dutch side of the belgian/ dutch border. there is an outside terrace if the sun is shining.
"went here for dinner with the extended family. attentive staff, nice menu, good choice in beverages. the only negative thing was that they were probably understaffed this particular night, so it took quite long between courses."
"we had a private room booked for an event, and got to spend all day there. we snacks, lunch and dinner at the restaurant, and everything was yummy! personal favorites: the deep fried shrimp from the snack board, and the chili scampi dish i had for dinne "
"the service was absolutely wonderful!! the food even topped that. as a buger lover, this was by the best buger i have had in the netherlands ......."
"like the atmosphere. typical place you visit in a private setting with family and/or friends. simple menu, great choice of good quality beers and reasonably price "
"this is a restaurant i always like to visit when i come to valkenswaard. formerly the kakelbont pancake house, t brabants genot, has kept the good comfort food and added some new dishes, including wild game when in seas "
"out to get a pancake with the visiting fam, pheazantly surprised to see game on the menu! so a wild ragout pancake.... absolutely delicious. booked the wild proeverij 8-course meal on 24th november. looking forward to that. anyway, always a good eat at brabants genot, pleasant and attentive service and relaxed atmosphere."
"we had lunch for 30 family and friends to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary. we used to live in netherlands so this was an ideal venue to meet with our dutch friends and our extended family who came here from the uk for a short holiday in de kempervennen, westerhoven. very friendly and efficient service and a good choice of food, especially pannenkoeken! impressed by the choice of local, seasonal beers (bokbieren van t vat). very child-friendly with good play areas both inside and outside. suited our 8 grandchildren aged 3 to 15 very well and staff very friendly to them. thanks especially to guus for her patience and ability to get all the orders right. overall a very good experience. for cyclists this venue is readily accessible via many good cycle routes."
we had lunch for a gathering of about 25 including children. the service and food were very good. the whole restaurant is very child friendly.
"i ate there twice, both times i enjoyed the salads i ordered. they had a very nice beer once. if you have children this is a nice place to be as they have a play ground."
had a business lunch and was offered a quiet place in the restaurant. great salads! quick and discreet service.
"great food, large portions for a small price. owner seemed really friendly and service was tip top. lovely terrace to spend an afternoon in the sun as well."
"when you look for good and tasty food in the best value for money setting available, make sure to go to hoom. burgers, salads, satay and my personal favorite ‚Äòossenhaas hoom‚Äô will make you come back for more. the food is fresh, well flavored, no complaints at all in view of quantity at your plate. make sure you have the home made ravigote sauce with your french fri "
"great hospitality, good value for money. we had a lovely family lunch. especially the service was worth singling out for its flexibility, friendliness and professionalism. we felt treated as guests."
"we come here already for a few years eating a business lunch or closing the year by having lunch just before christmas with colleagues. the food is of very good quality and the portions are huge. every year it surprises me that the service is slow. the time it takes before they come to you to take your orders is just too long. even if you asked to be served, it still takes them a while to finally come to you. part of the reason is that it is always busy other part is that it looks like they did not divide up the restaurant in sections. anyhow, we will be back calculating some extra time before our next scheduled meeting. or, we try to order by phone at the time of reservation; if at all possible."
"i am not a vegetarian but they serve a pasta that is to die for. my brother-in-law is and he says the vegetarian pasta is the best he has ever had. all their other dishes are superb. when we visit i always have this dish and save some to take home. however, the service is very slow but worth the wait. as a party of five we came in without a reservation and they accommodated us."
"we had both lunch and evening meals here. friendly, helpful with tasty food. try the hot stone steak - a speciality of the house"
"this is one of the few pubs we have in breukelen. it is run by a no nonsense family. very informal, and be prepared to meet with the local crowd. theyre happy to share their opinions with you. the menu is great if you like meat--which i do. "
"had drinks here with friends. friendly staff. music not too loud, easy to converse with each other. location on this center of town street is perfect."
"good food, nice people, good drinks. overall guests are middle age and up. good atmosphere. centre of brooklyn big terras."
"the regthuys in breukelen is a nice cafe in the center of breukelen. you have always same friendly people working there so after a few visits one knows another. the food is perfectly what you can expect from a cafe like this, may be even better. there is a nice variety and the price/quality is excellent. i would really recommend to stop by for a drink or an uncomlicated dining experience."
very helpful waiter served us lovely icecream and coffee! lovely stop and no smokers near us üëçüèºüëçüèº
"we only had a drink and an ice cream at the brasserie. but they advertised all main dishes at 10 ‚Ç¨, which sounded interesting. (but already had other plans for dinner)  staff was very friendly. would definitely go passed there again, if in the neighborhood."
we were on a bicycle trip from brugges to amsterdam and we stopped in breukelen on market day for a coffee on market day. we sat down to watch the day and have a break. we sat outside in a sunny da 
"i have been coming here since it opened and never had a complaint (except when they take flammkuchen off the menu haha). the service is great, nice to sit on the terrace and watch the boats go by."
"situated next to the son marina is this cosy restaurant with a simple but effective menu. especially when the weather allows sitting outside and there is activity on the water, this is a great place to have lunch and/or afternoon drinks. you forget time and just sit and watch. what a great way to spend an afternoon!"
"nice food, with the interesting theme of tapas (if you wish). atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, food tastes good and itll was a nice experience for us, but not extraordinary. might go back for a convenient dinner..."
"we go regularly to rozer in son and almost always choose from the long list of tapas dishes. sometimes 5 each, sometimes 13 or 15 in total. selection is always hard: they are all nice and different. the house wine (red) is ok and, just as everything, very reasonably priced. we have dinner for about ‚Ç¨40 in total and walk away happy and well-f "
"good menu and food, served well. good waitress and other staff. food was good value. the place was very friendly and a pleasand surroundings."
"we have been many times in this beautiful restaurant and appreciate a nice indonesian restaurant in town. the place is nicely decorated and gives space to dine. especially the fresh tables cloths give an atmosphere of luxury and dedication. the menu and food created is absolutely good, a bit salty, but dedicated indonesian and consistent through time. prices are very reasonable for the quality served. although allreally very good, how nice if the taste could be even brought up, closer to the original indonesian levelüòâüëç"
"been here many times now and the quality is consistent and good. the restaurant has nice clean table sheets, good modern atmosphere and the food is offering a wide range of dishes and menus. price and portions are really good. keeping up the quality and seeking and dearing to adhere to tru indonesian flavors will be the challenge."
"from the outside scheiwijk looks like an ordinary gas station, but inside the place is full of deli food, gourmet coffee and other good stuff. the staff is extremely friend "
scheiwijk is een excellent concept just for a quick break along the highway. the served food is excellent and a wide range of very nice local ingredients.
"my last visit was a heavenly d√©j√†-vu experience from the previous visit: homemade exquisite sandwiches with a touch of dutch, german, indonesian and japanese specialities and regional products. this is not just a gas station, it is a place of rest and enjoyment with people who know how to make a difference."
"i discovered this venue years ago, when coming back from amsterdam (it is approx 60 km from there, on the a 27, only southwards). i have been back ever since... and hearing foreign visitors and reading the reviews on ta i am surely not the only one to appreciate their reputati "
"we stopped here yesterday, on the way back from amsterdam to the channel tunnel. its the second time, having stopped there last summer on the same journey. its a fairly unremarkable site, compared to a lot of the huge dutch service stations but unique. a range of fresh food, ready made items, craft drinks and gifts all come together into a cool little stopping point for a break. only thing worth remembering is 50 eurocents for the toilets. i normally grumble about this but theirs are spotless and look like an architect designed them. it all adds to the experience, as a result!"
gas station with a rustic feel and many home made delicacies. we had a whole wheat panini with meat in peanut sauce. then bought a glass of peanut butter with chili peppers.... :)
this unremarkable little esso petrol station is hiding a secre 
was on a european business trip and had dinner on a saturday night with my daughter in my father‚Äôs home village. food was excellent and good sized portions. loved the bitterballen as an app. friendly staff and atmosphere. love to return in the summer and enjoy sitting beside the rotte. thank you ‚Äòt zeeltje hope to return.
"nice located restaurant with many tables inside (and firepit!) and outside on the terrace. beautiful view over the lake. the service is friendly and fast, the dishes well proportioned. a recommendation for family of business occasions!"
"the restaurant is located near a lake, and has some great food to offer. the meat is just perfectly grilled! the food is served with salads and fries. take the dame blanch as a desert! its great!"
"we have going to this restaurant for 5 years now and we are still very happy about the quality of the food. the ambiance is romantic and is perfect for a nice date. the service is friendly and welcoming. pasta, pizza and meat all dishes great taste and specially the dessert tiramisu."
nice italian family serving good price-quality italian food. lots of pizza and pasta choices. dine in restaurant or pizza delivery are both good. no outside terrace and delivery is sometimes slow... will come back often.
"lovely place for coffee/tea. traditional little place with delicacies, all fresh made. comes with real hospitality and service with a smile"
very good coffee and a somewhere typically dutch atmosphere. i love it even the weather was not the best.
"during september and i have been several times there.  the coffee is excellent. no matter if you choose normal coffee, cappuccino or irish coffee.  outside there is a covered terrace with  fire bowl. very copy."
"we ate dinner with 6 adults and a child, and even with two pregnant women, everything served was scarfed up and really yummy. service was great, and they handled all our requests warmly and efficiently. highly recommended!"
"the perfect place for high quality lunch and dinner. fresh qualityfood and the best service ever.  in the city of old rijswijk, near the city. very wide assortiment beers and wines.  you shoud pay a visit"
"when i am in rijswijk i always have a coffee there.  on the warm days it is nice to outside.  they also offer food. however,  i didnt tried up to now.  very friendly staff."
i have been in two caf√©s at one day.  this caf√© has have had the better cappuccino.  the staff is very friendly.
this is a nice place for a short break between shopping.  there were some tables ourside and the sun was shining.  the cappuccino was good and the service fast.
"busy nice little shop with gluten, vegan and other died options!! worth a visit if your in the area friendly staff!"
i have visited this caf√© after some shopping.   unfortunately i have had only time for cappuccino as the menue looked promising.  the cappuccino has been excellent. i will definitely return.
"stopped and sat in the sun for a while, lovely pavement cafe.  salad bowl with falafel was very nice.  i didnt have cake but nearby tables did and looked impressive.  friendly staff."
"the interior decoration could be touched up a bit, to give it more warmth, deeper colors, browns. but that does nothing to the use of fine coffee ingredients. wed go here again!"
"wonderful atmosphere, splendid service, very friendly and patient, the cook came by and chat with us, loved the d√∂ner chicken special. would definitely recommend to anyone visiting this city ‚ù§"
cozy place with delicios dutch food. the special pancake was the best one. really nice staff and it‚Äôs affordable. worth a visit!
"very cozy shop with warm and friendly staff. traditional dutch pancake and i ordered the natural one with egg and oude cheese, it smells and tastes super. only that the portion is so big, so i need to take away! definitely worth trying! :)"
this spot is a gem! it is a small little restaurant where you can eat savoury and sweet pancakes - and they are delicious. we went on a saturday at lunch time and had a very nice spot to sit. the waitress was really nice and let us feel very welcome. i strongly recommend you going there.
very friendly staff. the pannenkoeken was really good. very good enviroment.  i went with my nephew and she loved the food too.  i would recommend everybody to try üòä
"delicious pancakes, one of the best ive tried. rich and varied menu with lots of options. first time im trying dutch pancakes, i tried the apple and bacon pancake as well as the poffertjes. the owner is super warm and kind. cozy place with plants and chill music. totally recommend this place to eat pancakes!"
"we loved this place! friendly and helpful staff, great (large!) pancakes and a lovely atmosphere. we were here with three children and there was plenty of space for them and drawing activities to entertain them. thanks for a lovely evening out as part of our long weekend trip from uk! "
"the pancakes are huge, delicious and the service wonderful. you can really tell the care and want you to enjoy yourself! highly recommend!"
"stopped in for dinner. food was wonderful, service attentive and quick. the next day we returned for the poffertjes (only offered on weekends until 5pm). we recommend you make this a stop if you are in the area."
"this is the kind of place that makes you feel like family the moment you walk through the door. our dutch isnt great but the staff were really happy to help us in english, which was really appreciated as they explained the complicated special so we were able to order and really enjoy it! our child was really well looked after and he really enjoyed his decorate-your-own pancake (small warning: it comes with a lot of hagelslag/sprinkles, though im sure they would give you less if you asked)"
"i was there twice and will definitely visit that place again. first time i got an uitsmijter pannenkoek with cheese and beacon. it was given with some sweet chili sauce. in addition, they suggested me another ananas sauce. it was also sweet and tasty. overall it was a good match: fueling big pancake and sweet sauces. i was not able to finish a whole pancake at once and took left part away with me. second time they suggested me their specials of the day, i tried one. it was pancake with plums, cottage cheese, walnuts and cinnamon. so yummy! very pleasant pancake. now i am eager to taste what else they hav "
visited as a family. both kids loved their pancakes. special unicorn shaped pancake for youngest with bowls of ingredients to personalise. veggie pancake catered for. special touch was chef patron coming out of kitchen to ensure we were having a great meal.
"absolutely delicious. great ambiance, excellent service, personal attention.  thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  highly recommend"
excellent pannekoeken. it does not matter if you ro decide for sweat or savory. all ate excellent. moderate priced. excelkent staff.
"best poffertjes in the netherlands. amazing service, super friendly! we will come back soon for sure!üôèüèª"
"not the only are the pancakes special, but the owner is very kind and friendly. the pancakes you get are cooked with ‚ù§"
"a true dutch treat. after living in the netherlands for many years i can say these are the best dutch pancakes we have had. the owner is very friendly. the ingredients are all local, like the flour which is sourced from an old windmill in the area. the recipe for the pancakes has been specially developed by the owner. whether you like a sweet or savory version of the pannenkoek they are all very tast "
it is an amazing place with delicious food and really good service. i went for lunch and that was a great experience. totally recommended.
delicious food and wonderful service. lovely outside area and activities (coloring in and play kitchen) for kids.
this restaurant makes the best pannekoeken in rijswijk.   i have been there a few times and has been always satisfied.
"during our stay in the netherlands we wanted to taste pancakes and poffertjes (dutch mini pancakes). we chose de pannenkoeken club and it was the best choice we could make. both pancakes and poffertjes were delicious! both the owners and staff were very nice and kind! the restaurant is located several steps from the tram station on the way between the hague and delft. if you want to taste delicious pancakes and poffertjes, we do recommend this restaurant!"
"nice, quiet family run business. great pancakes and wonderful service! im on a vacation trip to see friends and i recommend it!"
really excellent pancakes. the staff was very friendly. all in all excellent service. i will visit this place soon again.
"extremely delicious pancakes, good atmosphere and amazing staff! also, one of the very few kids friendly restaurants in rijswijk. our family loved it and therefore we highly recommend it!"
we had the best pannekoek and poffertjies here. the hospitality was great and we got to meet a fellow south african!  highly recommended for quality pancakes in all varieties thinkable....
"very friendly host, lovely pancakes, typical dutch, relaxed, cosy restaurant, fairly priced. will definitaly come here again."
"have been eating in here , very nice food, in a historic setting. before eating we had a few drinks in the bar and outside the restaurant in front off the place. they serve a lot off food meat, fisch and vegetarian. the service was good and friendly."
"my daughter moved to rijswijk 4 years ago so we visit quite regularly. her partner comes from rijswijk and ouds nest is a family favourite. we have been around 5 times so far. in earlier years the food was solid if not spectacular. lest year, with new owners it stepped up several rungs to a very friendly and pleasent evening with very good food. as we english both the owners son and daughter who were waiting on chatted about wanting to go to england and why had my daughter move to holla "
very good food and modest pricing ! location is for me very memorable because it is close to the werve that once belonged to shell and were  my family spent such great moments
"picked this out because i always like to eat local food wherever i go. i wasnt disappointed here. picking semi randomly from the dutch menu i ended started with a small egg salad (quail?) followed by a lamb ragout(?) with chips (mayo), surprisingly, potato wedges too, salad and a cabbage/smoked ham ensemble. all absolutely delicious. bottled beers here are great too. the owner is happy and friendly to this accidental tourist."
"another good meal at t nest, cafe pleasantly located in an old building with a couple of restaurant annexes close to the te werve estate in rijswijk. veal liver with onions, bacon and apple expertly cooked, mixed grill with beef, pork and chicken well prepared with quality meat. good garni with fried potatoes and french fries. sauces a little bit sub standard, tasted like they came from a package. good quality coffee, generous creme brulee and a nice red housewine (carmenere and also other choices). chilled pink port was delicious. will definitely return."
"the location is great - very old building, a lot of history. food is decently cooked, but the choice is limited. also serves as a very decent pub, and it has a great garden in the back, and a nice terrace in front - great for summer evenings!"
"pub/restaurant in traditional dutch style with the friendliest staff you can imagine. terraces in front, at the side and in the rear give you a choice for sun or shade. the whole inn gives the impression that you would not be surprised to see a stagecoach stopping to take on passengers. not too complicated a menu but its altered regularly with seasonal items. fixed items on the menu are fresh fish always or like now, early september, mussels and chips. goes wonderful with a salad. there is a smaller snacks-like card for lunch and afternoon e.g. with a meatball, hamburger or a large (dutch type) pancake cheese, bacon, syrup et "
"the nest is a long-standing rijswijk landmark, where staff treat the regulars like friends or even family! the food is good, the ambience is great, and the music is comfortable. definitely the place to be come football-season!"
"this is the combination of a dutch cafe (bruin cafe) with a restaurant in the back in a somewhat historic building (dated 1702). the food is solid dutch restaurant food. i particularly enjoyed the liver, it is not that easy to get well prepared liver anymore in restaurants. but they also serve many other more mainstream dishes."
"located near the te werve park this dutch restaurant ofters a real dutch experience. the staff speak little, but enough, english and there are no english menus. dont let that stop you. every dish on the menu is great. the kabeljauw - cod - is wonderful and the ribs never fail to please. the restaurant is in the back of the building with the bar in front. on warm days there is outside eating. the dining area looks like an older home and has a warm homey feel. the house wine is ok and a good price. we have never had dessert because we are always full after the main meal."
"when in rijswijk, for indonesian take-away food there is fierce competition between pasar makan and toko kediri. both offer excellent meals and have their fans, but we keep returning to pasar makan for their authentic flavours and friendly smiles. when take-away and eat-at-home is not possible for you, the restaurant offers a limited number of seats. however reservation is a must (especially in the weekends) as the place is extremely popular! you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes, try the dish-of-the-day if you are unsure or just ask the staff!"
what a wonderful little gem hidden in rijswijk. we called into this restaurant owned by gina and frans on a cold december saturday. the welcome was warm and the food was truly warming. a large number of local residents either called in for lunch or for a take away. the restaurant also sells a number of dry indonesian food goods including my favourite emping. 
for more then 15 years i come here to either take away or din 
pasar makan is conveniently located close to the (old) heart of rijswijk. parking space is available but not plentiful. it is a casual restaurant with a good variety of indonesian food which you can order by the plate. staff are very friendly and prices are acceptable. will return.
nice and fresh the best food i ever taste food like this restaurant. its great environment too.highly recommended
"very nice indian cuisine restaurant, the food is very  good and full of flavour. the setting inside and out is very nice ."
one of the best dinner via thuisbezorg we had in the last years. we took different dishes and all were tasty. great portions‚Ä¶we‚Äôll definitely go to the restaurant one evening since we enjoyed it so much
"i had a nice evening at little nepal. i was there with some friends and colleagues. the service was great and the food tasted really yummy. we ordered momo, chicken tikka biryani, green chilli chicken tikka masala, chicken tikka grilled. the food is reasonably priced and the nepali tune they play in the background is also very pleasant. recommend it highly."
we were three and have been satisfied all. the food is really nice and the service is also very good.
nice authentic restaurant with very good food.   every was very tasty and nicely arranged.  this evening only 3 tables were occupied.  very friendly and competend staff.
the food was very healthy and good in tast 
i have traveled quite a lot in europe and this is the best restaurant for me when it comes to nepalese dishe 
this restaurant serves delicious traditional nepalese food. the couple who runs the restaurant is very friendly and provides great service. the prices are low for the great food you get.
"i often go to little nepal to enjoy great food and hospitality. the food is delicious, reasonably priced and the couple who run the restaurant are very friendly. they are very open to cater your needs and changes you might need in the menu (including the desired spicy level). you can also enjoy authentic nepali tunes with the food. must haves are: momos, chicken tikka biryani, sweet lassi."
ive been visiting this restaurant for nigh on ten years because of the excellent quality of both the food and the hospitality of the own 
per accident  i have found this nice restaurant when i have been walking from old rijswijk to the direction of tram  
"as other reviewers mentioned, theres nothing special about the look of the restaurant. its basically a neighbourhood restaurant, somewhat dark and with a few tables. the food, however, is excellent. the service, even if a little slow, was extremely welcoming; our server went as far as going to the kitchen to find their recipe for a dish we loved (the paneer tikka). highly recommended."
the place does not seem very attractive at first sight but the quality of the dishes is really high. the only con is the time you wait but when you taste the food you understand that it us cook at the moment. really recommended
went here after walking around the area.  we made a reservation also.  food was absolutely fabulous!  not too spicy (but i love spicy food).  even the hottest thing on the menu was not hot (ask to have it made the way the cooks eat it).
i wanted to try this place at my friends suggestion. so ordered from a delivery service (thuisbezor 
went here with friends. food was good and our server was very friendly. nice little restaurant with good prices.
"the restaurant has good food, but not particularly raving. but what can you expect because it is not too expensive. and that makes it attractive. good food for average price. the big problem is too find a parking place."
"i m also chef cook and quality of food was fresh and perfect,and service was top.locatation of the restaurent is perfect.you can park your car in front of restaurent,with out any cost.just go and try then you know about it."
delicious food. we have been here with family. the taste is great and the price is normal of even cheap. the service is very friendly.
"we went there with a few colleagues for diner and were agreably surprised by the quality of the food and service. i must say that due to my lack of knowledge of the nepalese food i found it quite similar to indian food and equally delicious. word of advice: avoid the vindaloo as it was wickedly hot, even for my trained taste buds. definitely going back!"
"no matter what you pick its going to be delicious. we like to try new things so we pick one new thing every time, and its the kind of place where something new is a good surprise every time."
"delicious food,we have eaten  here for the first time....and it was great taste. the service was attentive. the decor was also very nice simple in design. it was great experience to be at little nepal. we will come back  :) :)."
"the food is great for affordable prices but the restaurant would need a serious make-over if not a full renovation. i confirm that although the service is very friendly, it is also quite slow."
"great food, excellent service, low prices. our waitress was very hospitable and went out of her way to customize our meals with suggestions and alternative (side) dishes that were not on the menu. the flavours of the individual dishes were distinct and complemented each other. prices were very reasonable (25 euro for three courses). only possible downside:we were there on a slow night (4 tables) and had to wait for 40 minutes for our main course; wondering what will happen on a busy night....."
"excellent food, authentic still, and very friendly. small and cosy restaurant, simple place, but very good choice of food and specialities for all tests."
"i have been to this restaurant twice, first time with my friends and second with one of my dutch colleagues. the food is delicious, and people are really nice. my only complain is that the momo was not as good as i though it would be to impress my dutch friend "
love the typically nepalese mix of indian and chinese food here. sometimes you have to wait a while before you get your food.
"love indian food and little nepal is the closest indian restaurant to my home. been eating here for about three years and never had a bad meal. all the usual indian standards are on offer along with a few nepalese dishes. the quality of the food is great, though if you have been brought up on uk indian food, its best to order the dishes a little hotter than normal. the service is very friendly but extremely slow. all the food is cooked to order, so be prepared to sit and chat between courses - not the place to visit if you are in a hurry. cost, including a couple of drinks is about eur 30 per head"
"we went to indrapura on the day they re-opened after the corona lockdown. they had been closed for months and somehow the kitchen could not cope with demand. many tables had ordered dinner around 6 pm and it took a long time for our meal to be served. after more than an hour our dinner arrived and we were starving. all the dishes were excellent so we were more than happy with the food. faster service would have resulted in a 5 star rating. waiting for your order is ok, half an hour, fourty minutes maybe, but an hour is too long. our server was excellent and so was the food."
nice restaurant with the typical dutch combination of indonesian food.  we were three and nearly the only guest ( except one other table).  there was enough space.  the food was good and the staff friendly.
i have been there a few times during the last years. most of the times i ordered something to take away.  the food is quite good but nothing special.  the service is fast and friendly.
"indonesian restaurant indrapura is getting more and more popular and thats well deserved. the food is always very good, the service is friendly and professional and the service is not toot fast or too slow, just right the is always enough parking space nearby, but parking is not entirely free. iss free for the first 2 hours, so in the end you pay little or nothing for parking, depending on the length of your stay. there is little. today we had the 4 course surprise menu, which was very nice. we got 2 kinds of kroepoek (prawn crackers), next we got a combo of soempia, loempia and sesame balls, then 3 kinds of sate, then 2 meat dishes (duck and goat) and a fish dish (surimi and prawns), with rice (there was a choice of fried rice, boiled white rice, or noodles). then a choice of 3 deserts. when we ordered, we were asked about our preference for fish and/or meat, so they will adapt the menu to your taste. altogether a very good meal and a pleasant experience. we will be back!."
"the food was nice and prepared with  care, but the portions were too little. maybe that is to be expected if you go through ticketveiling.nl.maybe my expectations were unrealistic. staff was very friendly."
"indrapura is not in the city center, which makes it less likely to attract a lot of tourists. the advantage is that there is lots of free parking nearby. in the restaurant we were welcomed by 2 ladies who were very attentive and served us very well. we had a rijsttafel consisting of many dishes, all of which were very nice, with authentic indonesian flavours. as we were celebrating a birthday, we sang happy bithday and when we left, the birthday girl who was celebrating her 83rd birthday, was given a small present by the waitress. a very nice gesture! lovely food, service, atmosphere, all at a fair price. we will be back! "
"forget all the others, if you want to taste good chinese food, and even good indonesian food go here. for over 40 years (i am not that old) this restaurant serves it‚Äôs costumers the best food there is"
nice location with good fo 
we went there for a business lunch. it was an interesting experience. good quality and service and very nice location. free parking just in front of the door. to come back again.
"beste chinees in nederland. lekker ouderwets chinezen.  this is the best chinese restaurant in the netherlands, and the indische rijstafel is really good too!"
"it has been a couple of years since i last ate at the golden house, so decided to pay them a visit. as other reviewers have mentioned, this is a pretty large restaurant and is quite often very full at weekends ‚Äì seems to be a favourite with famili "
"this relatively spacious restaurant offers comfortable seats that are not packed together. its a great place for having conversations because of the discrete atmosphere. the food however is not that special, just the regular chinese cook without anything remarkable. including the somewhat above-average price in our judgment, it adds up to a mere 4 stars. i may visit here again to chat and catch up with friends, or for a drink while doing some work on the laptop, but not particularly for the menu."
"on a thursday night i went here for some take away food for two persons. i had some sat√© ayam, mihoen goreng with chicken and foe yong hai with chicken. all tasted good, especially the sat√©. the portions are big so it is possible to eat it in two days or with more than two persons. the restaurant was crowded on that thursday night, has a huge menu and looked good from the inside. we paid 24 euros which is a fair price. i will be back here!"
in corona times it is great to be still able to takeaway the superb daily indonesian dish at tjendrawasih. very hygienic service and required distance properly adhered to. food very tasty and great to consume at home with some krupuk and a beer.
"various indonesian rijsttafels , sateh gambing is excellent.....friendly staff....everyone enjoyed it very much ! many dishes and delicious ! i often eat there and when i leave they always say : see you tomorrow üòÇ"
"tjendrawasih continues to deliver consistent top notch quality for indonesian takeaway (‚Äútoko‚Äù). you can also eat in their shop, they have seating. prices have been the same for many years, 7 euros for a delicious daily menu. many returning customers such as me!"
"tjendrawasih delivers consistent quality for indonesian takeaway meals ... their daily menu with spicy rice is quite gorgeous. the sateh kambing (goat) is to die for. since their sister restaurant rajawali was closed, you can also have a sit-down dinner there."
"the atmosphere is not the best, very simple decoration, nevertheless the food is excellent (take away also possible). there is a good variety of foods meats/fish/vegetarian. the taste is good and i know as i family inlaws are indonesian! i can certainly suggest it."
"the atmosphere of the restaurant could be improved, but the food, taste is beyond excellent! parking is not a problem in the area."
"tjendrawasih is a toko still, but now also has a restaurant section which is opened until 10pm on tue-sunday. food remains great indonesian. service sweet and friendly."
"tjendrawasih has a gorgeous takeaway buffet from which you can make your selections... but to make it easy they also offer a predefined daily menu for about 7 euros. i like to take it with spicy nasi (fried rice) really good. also their peanut sauce is gorgeous, true indonesian, and their sateh kambing is to die for. "
"thendrawasih is a takeaway with small restaurant capability (a toko) with superbly outstanding authentic indonesian food. day menu for 6,50 warmly recommended! fantastic sateh kambing!"
"the best indonesian take away of the randstad. original indonesian recipes from grandma are used that will bring your taste buts to this country. all fresh and original ingredients are used and this causes you to come back and back. just to sit down and eat lunch is great. i love the ajam smoor chicken which has an amazing sauce with unions and cloves that gives me a great smile, with tender chicken and spice rice combined with sajoir lodah vegetabl "
"nice toko next to my home. very delicious dishes, especially chicken cashew. not very expensive.  strongly recommend!"
talamini prepares and serves excellent real italian icecream in quite unusual varieties. outstandingly good! would easily rate it 5 stars if not the staff behind the counter were busily engaged in conversation and could not spare a smile for the customer (although they helped quickly).
excellent ice cream.   a lot of different flavours. very good taste and moderate priced.  very friendly staff.
i have been again there on a hot day in july.  as usually the ice cream has been excellent.   the service also very friendly.
i know this caf√© many years. it is a traditional ice cream shop in old rijswijk.   very good are also the ice cream tarts which are a lovely dessert or a nice present.  very friendly service.
great ice cream. but why oh why is it open for such a short period? wed love to have ice cream also in winter.
they have the best ice cream ive ever had in the netherlands and ive been to quite a lot of ice cream bakeries. the natural taste of each kind of ice cream make them the best.
"talamini, located in the old town center of rijswijk, is definitely your best choice for ice cream in the region. we love going there with our kids during the summer months. its only a short bike ride from our ho "
"all the ice cream variety is juuuust so delicious!  my fave is cherry mania, cappucino and tiramisu.."
"very delicious ice cream. good prices. and they have a good customer friendly programme that if you buy ice cream 10 times for 5 euro, you get half liter of ice cream for free. its pretty cool."
"tandoori lamb - the presentation is like a sizzler, the meat is like a steak, and yet the taste is familiarly indian. that‚Äôs just perfect for non-indians to experience indian cuisin "
"the food was amazing. it is really hard to find good indian food in the netherlands, but this restaurant has some of the best indian food i have ever eaten!"
"a dinner was all that took me here. it is located in reijswijk (pronounced as rys wyk), it takes some amount of walking to reach here. the location is close to the city center. it is also located in an area known for restaurants, so sorrounding is good and gave a semblance of old ci "
"my friend and i walked into this restaurant early in the evening (just before 18:00) on boxing day, looking for a place to ea "
good service and excellent food. a large variety of indian dishes from mild to very spicy. relaxed and cosy atmosphere.
we wanted to go and have dinner in the centre of rijswijk and we decided to try out the clay oven. its located in a very code street with very old buildings. the ambiance inside was great and the hostess were lovel 
we liked the froendlines of the staff and very delicious food. we were surprised as the portions are very big and the prices are reasonable. we will return for sure.
i enjoy eating here everytime im the neighborhood. the quality and service are very good. my favorite thing on the menu is by fat the chicken tiki masala and the almond naan.
"the environment is quite end peaceful, the staff is helpful and nice and the food is really good. they have several vegetarian options. by the way, they have great coffee for the dutch standards since they have a professional expresso machine. the prices seem a bit high though but not so high gor the dutch standards."
"nice indian restaurant in rijswijk. nice and clean, decoration tasteful. menu card relatively limited but variated. had a great curry spicy and with fresh ingredients. prices fair. good value for money."
superfriendly staff and typical indian dishes with emphasis on tandoori dishes. the paneer and chicken tikka tandooris are my favorites. take away also possible.
"this open-kitchen indian restaurant is the lifes work of the owner, mr. sarker. you may find him attending your table, ensuring everything is just right. an extensive menu will satisfy every taste; the tasting menus are nicely varied and excellent value. many vegetarian options. while the building is vintage, the interior is entirely made over in natural tones with india accents. order your preferred heat level, the kitchen will meet your needs. fresh ingredients freshly cooked with attention to detail -- go feast! (btw, catering, carry-out, and banquet facilities are available)"
"visited this resturant after a spending the day at the beach. atmosphere is okay and the resturant itself is located in a peaceful area. we ordered a mix platter option, and were served 3-4 dishes menu for three persons in a mixed serving. (it would be nice if serving is made on individual basis, considering some eat more then others;) owner was nice guy explananing the dishes and suggesting options to order, the other staff was not very engaging, the food served was quite good. especially the chicken curry option was done really well and the soup as a starter is highly recommended to try. chicken tandoori (grilled chicken) could have been done better, overall nice resturant and the menu option to order one and try many is really good especially when you are new to indian cusine, recommended place to eat"
"chosen by my dutch colleague to try indian food, this was actually a good choi "
"the clay oven has great indian food which is delicious whether you want it just tasty spicy or hot spicy!  great service, friendly staff and gorgeous interior."
i recently visited the clay oven as i was missing good indian food while on myntravel to netherlands. found this restaurant as closest to my hotel and decided to try. was pleasantly surprised. food was good and authentic indian taste. good quantity as well. service was excellent. the staff were very keen to make it a good experience. strongly recommend if yiu are in the area.
"when i arrived only one other table was occupied. the service was excellent, the meal was delectable, the spicyness was perfect, the garlic naan was amazing."
the restaurant has been there for about a year. i am not a great fan of indian food but we went there with some family members. what a pleasant surprise it was. the food was tasty and plenty and the atmosphere really nice. good service and definitely worth to come back.
"we stopped by early in the evening and the place was still empty but that soon changed. the service was friendly and the food very flavourfull, we will definitely come here again and the restaurant is nice addition to the herenstraat."
"had dinner here in november 2015; great food, very affordable, accompanied by some great beer! their mango lassi is also a great choice!"
"everything a good indian restaurant should be: fantastic food (their tikka massala is the best i ever tried in holland), friendly but discreet service and ok prices. i was happy to discover that the restaurant does not have this characteristic spice mix smell -well done! i cant wait to go there again!"
"wonderful indian food, sweet, very attentive staff, very relaxed atmosphere in the heart of the old rijswijk."
came across this restaurant actually by accident when looking for a decent dinner with a custom 
"having enjoyed a takeaway from the restaurant just after it first opened, i finally got round to visiting with some friends for a birthday celebration. the staff were very welcoming and helpful and the food was brought to the table quickly. we had a nice mix of starters between the four of us (quite small portions but perfectly adequate given the mains to follow) then lamb/chicken/prawn/vegetarian mains plus a selection of extras and breads. i tasted all of the mains and thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful - some were hotter than others but all were beautifully spiced. we were too full to order desserts however, while waiting for the bill, i was given a birthday surprise sparkling mango ice cream - a lovely end to the meal. the bill including drinks was under 140 eur so very good value for money. id definitely recommend a visit or, at least, try the takeaway."
"the clay oven opened around february in risjkwijk and having heard some good reports, decided to pay them a visit. the place was very inviting, decor good and very fresh, as you would expect from a new restaura "
"an absolute must-see-and-go when youre in rijswijk. delicious breads, cakes, cookies, snacks and sandwiches.and very friendly service!"
still a good location for a coffee or a something to drink.  the pannekoeken with bacon is also very good.  no place to have a dinner but perfect for a short break.
nice location with a covered heated veranda for smokers ( in winter or for bad weather ) and some table outside in summ 
i really like it. during the season they have 12 different flavours of ice-cream in the nice shop. in addition they also sell chocolate bars.
honemade icecream in the beautiful center of maassluis. lots of different delightfull tastes. price is somewhat high but quality excellent
"really great ice cream and very good value for money. we visit quite a lot over the summer months and the flavors are fantastic, plenty of seating inside and o "
"even the italians are jealous on this ice cream. ben & jerrys is trying to unravel the recipys of jeroen. ola tries to buy his ice creams and kalise has tried to copy them. nobody succeed, so try them out on the marketplace in central maassluis. i have been there a lot of times and enjoying every icecream taste."
"jeroen and his wife ,are both master ice makers verry nice shop and ecelent ice cream and many flavours"
a 15-minute stroll on a warm weekend afternoon brings us to this splendid home-made ice-cream shop in the old centre of maassluis. the quality of the ice and the service are superb. go out of your way to drop by - you wont regret it!
they have the best ice cream ever. many different tastes. i am always very tempted to go in and buy an ice cream when i walk past.
"this is one of the best icecreams shops in town and with so many great vari√©t√©s, a must for any ice cream lover!!"
the place to take your refreshment in maassluis. home-made ice cream prepared in the factory behind the shop. perfect location in the middle of the town near the harbour and many shops.
"great ice-cream, home-made in its own small factory behind the shop. lots of different tastes, almost as good as italian."
do not miss this ice cream place. a great assortiment of different ice creams. also diabetic available. very nice staff.
"a tiny italian restaurant and take-away off the beaten-track serving excellent freshly made pizza and pasta dishes. small and plain, its not a place for a intimate evening but it is a bit special. my pizza was wonderfully thin and crispy, but my wifes pasta had very little of the meat it was supposed to have (ossenhaas) and the truffle was non-existent. that said, the home-made tiramisu is to die for - save space for it!"
"when we visited gioja we were blown away by the quality of the food. the taste, everything was as my friends told me. perfect. small point of improvement: the pasta with seafood was very heavy on salt. but h√©, this could happen.."
this is by far the best italian restaurant in the neighberhood; everything is freshly made by italian people for a good price. once you have been here you never want to go anywhere else!
we got loads of indonesian colleagues and they all tasted us their traditional dishes. the food over there tastes much better than it does in the netherlands on average.. however.. haven indah is an exception for sure! lovely food at all times! perfect take away and delivery service too!
"always friendly staff, i have been eating here for 12 year "
"great place. at the entrance one of the people (maybe the owner) said that we will eat the best breakfast in town here. he lied because it was the best breakfast in the whole netherlands. we took the de lux breakfast there. huge selection, everything fresh, delicious. very nice service. bathroom cleaner than many hotels. amazing place."
we visited just for coffees. they were lovely. the food on offer looked good. unfortunately we had to move on for lunch. this place has some indoor seating and a little outside the front. but most is located over the road on a floating canal barge - charming
the village of spijkenisse is attrative to visit. old fishing village with a lot of historical buildings. walking around gives appetize for a good lunch. in the centre we had a good lunch at a boat in the canal. service was very good and the food very good for a reasonable price. good to revisit
"we stopped here to eat on our way to the ferry home and the good reviews we had read did not disappoint. we found it was open on sunday evening (ptobably cos summer hols time) and the staff were friendly and helpful (our dutch is non-existent). nice relaxed atmosphere sitting outside; we just had bread with dips and olives as a starter and if was yummy... main dish of chicken fillet in paprika sauce with peppers, mushrooms onions and trimmings was colourful and really tasty, wiped up every bit from.the plate. would definitely come here again if in the area!"
"we have now enjoyed two meals here in 3 days, the food, the service and ambiance, were all excellent."
monsieur paul is one of my favorite places to go to in maassluis. food is always average in variety but good in quality! especially when the weather is nice it‚Äôs lovely to sit outside on the terrace. it is that we like our own house to chill too. otherwise we would come here more often!
went to this amazing cafe twice last week for both cake and breakfast on our way to and from hook of holland. fantastic food and lovely service will definitely go back next time we visit
always a nice visit. food is always great and there is a little boat you can also sit on in the sun during summ 
excellent location in maassluis. boat deck during good weather. good quality food and drinks and above all nice staff.
we regularly visit to enjoy the moment with a drink and something nice from the menu. i can recomment their burgers ;)
"we arrived in maassluis at 9am on a cold, gloomy sunday morning, feeling not too hopeful wed be able to get a coffee so early. and then we spotted monsieur paul, putting out his tables. he was so friendly and chatty, and made us feel so cheerful. the coffee and food was lovely. the cafe is very picturesque. but the best thing was monsieur paul himself."
"nice atmosphere, great sandwiches for lunch but also try the hapas & tapas for diner. absolute worth a visit"
"a nice place to stop buying fresh bread, having something to drink or having lunch. especially in summer on the boat in front of monsieur paul. inside it could be (too) busy!"
i grew up in maassluis and this place has always been popular with locals. bread etc freshly made and plenty of choice for everyone.
"you can have here a very good lunch. they sell very good petit  pains and club sandwiches, little pizza s. during the lunch you can have several salades like goat salad with honey and bread"
"after some sightseeing in maassluis on a very windy and cool day in may, we found this restaurant to be the perfect spot for a coffee break. it has the most charming of d√©cor, a mix of old and new, with pictures on the walls of not only the town, to show how its grown, but its people as well. it just has a very cozy feeling to it which i absolutely adored. we chose to sit at the back patio, which is more or less a sunroom, a delightful surprise for although it was windy and cold the sun was shinning and this was the perfect way to enjoy it. i ordered a caramel koffie which came accompanied by a chocolate truffle covered in cocoa powder. both coffee and truffle were absolutely divine! delicious beyond words! i cant wait for our next visit to maassluis, for if the coffee tastes that good than the food must be mind blowing!"
it was pretty cold and windy in may so we sit inside near the lovely balcony at the back of the restaurant. it was a nice balcony with 4 tables that sit 16 people. the food we ordered was great and fresh. the price was reasonable. if the weather was nice sitting outside or on the boat would be lovely so we could enjoy the atmosphere of this old town.
"had a family dinner here. chose for the three course menu and i must say, the bavette was surprisingly good! restaurant was running at a limited capacity due to covid19. staff was very friendly."
"my favorite restaurant. delicious food, nice staff, lots of special menus. cosy restaurant nearby parking place"
"i visited kevin‚Äôs while working here in massluiss. the service was great, they had menus in english which was of great help to me being scottish.   the food was outstanding, it was a busy place and i can see why it‚Äôs very popular.   highly recommended."
we had a nice 3 course meal. we said goodbye to one of our excellent interns. we had good food we good portions.
"been there with our family (3 kids). friendly people and good food for normal price. normally the kids does not eat much, but there was enogh choice on the menu."
i enjoyed my dinner here though i think there could be a wee bit more choice but was told the menu changed every now and then. friendly service and nice ambiance.
quick and decent service. uitsmijter was ok. nice menu for lunch. price is also affordable. crowded for a lunch this does suggest that it is a popular place.
drove round and round this little place looking for a bar or restaurant on the way to the port. eventually found the town square where there was a great variety of places. the eetcafe was a good choice. the staff were welcoming and efficient. the menu offering lots of options as well as a specials. the service was also quic 
good place to eat. meals are not spectacular but ok. they serve a lot of different beers.  easy to stay after dinner for a good time and some beers.
"always great food and beers! the staff is very kind and always smiling. always good the be there!  love the beers aswell, great variaty."
"friends of mine invited me for lunch in de buren and they could not have invited me for a better place. the baquette de buren was excellent, fresh and food was served fast by waitress marion who despite being busy combined this with a friendliness that makes one feel welcomed here."
"i believe this restaurant is part of a chain of restaurants, however, i never visited one before. i was there for lunch with a group of three other people and we all ordered something different. it was quite difficult to make a choice as they have quite an extensive lunch menu. however, all of us eventually made a choice. we had to wait quite some time for it to arrive, but that didnt matter as we were in no rush. it was definitely worth the wait when it arrived! all four of us were very happy with our choices. it was all freshly made and very good value for money."
"very nice returent,  the prices are great, and the service is wonderful. comfy and charming place, good for families"
"great place, renende a year ago, but same hospitality, same kindness, same people, but a quit different approach on the menu. very nice choices and still wonderful food."
excellent food and fast service. you can order the food and take it to home to use the dinner in your family setting.
"on the way home after visiting the zoo, we stopped at yangs garden. we ordered some vegetarian to take away. the service was good, the price was reasonable, big portion and unexpectedly very tasty."
"a very nice and cosy restaurant where it is better to book a table. all dishes, fish or meat, are really fresh (from water nearby or from the field also nearby). our steaks were excellent, tender. desserts also good. and staff was really nice, welcoming and providing advice on nice things to do in the area!"
"if you plan to eat here, make a reservation. this a cozy place with only a few tables. there is also an outdoor terrace at the water side, a very nice stay when the weather permits. outstanding food quality , made from locally farrmed ingredients. pricing is at the low range, and are certainly a bargain considered the quality. very friendly staff. nice beers, wines and drinks on the me "
"having had one evening meal and several beers from their huge list of craft beers, i returned twice for more, as the food was excellent, the setting beautiful, and the staff very welconing. my favourite was the fish soup-- a dish i had twice, it was so good. i tried another nearby restaurant, but it was not as good, in my opinion, so i went back the next night to the bolwerk!"
"driving between giethoorn and amsterdam, we stopped in sloten hoping for some lunch to match the old dutch ambience of the village. too cold for the canal side seating, we went inside the tavern where it was warm and cozy "
after walking through the city of sloten we saw the restaurant bolwerk! they have seating outside on the canal and it looks very inviting to sit down and have some lunch. we sat down and had lunch and we were very happy with everything. the meals were excellent and the waitresses very friendly. the prices are very reasonable. we had a very pleasant afternoon at the bolwerk. if we lived closer we would definitely come back for more.
"one of the best pizzas in the utrecht area. very good wood-fired pizza. friendly staff. cozy place to eat, although i normally take out."
"honestly, the oven pizza here is awesome!  i felt as if i were eating back in italy. i never expected to find such authentic, cozy italian place in utrecht area. they focus on quality rather than quantity."
"again we ordered some pizzas here. pasta is not an option yet, its all about pizza and anti past "
pizza and pasta a la mama! very good food served by friendly staff. all the right flavors are there. ingredients were very fresh and tasty and that my friends is the most i lik 
"very small restaurant that also makes pizzas for take away. the pizzas are light and thin with a loverly crispy dough. they are absolutely delicious and you can see that the owners truly care about their food. unfortunately , the pizza are so light that they are also not terribly filling. my kids managed to finish their grown up pizzas without batting an eye, which meant that as an adult with an average to larger apetite you leave feeling like you could probably have eaten at least another half pizza. but at 12 euros for a pizza, you dont."
delicious treats await while an awesome playground next to the restaurant will keep your kids busy. kids said the hot chocolate
"set in the park over looking the water. a good venue to lunch with friends. sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. our waiter was friendly and efficient, quickly providing menus and taking drink orders. we did notice that the restaurant was very busy but short staffed. our salads were large, fresh and enjoyable. we then indulged in their carrot cake, which is excellent. "
nice meals and drinks in a very nice place. the food is served by very nice waiters and the can also give you a good advice.
we recently went on the boxing day. it was difficult to get a table in the beginnig as the place was completely booked. the staff was dressed in traditional attire and were warm & friend 
"what else can i say? my wife is a vegan and got a specially prepared vegan meal! friendly staff and a varied menu in a home style atmosphere. they even have cultural nights here now and then. location is great, in the middle of a beautiful park. recommended!!"
"the location is really pretty and honestly that is the real sell of the restaurant. it is located in the middle of a large park and if the weather is nice, it is a gorgeous location. just be ware that their is a huge playground literally next to the restaurant so there will be a lot of little kids running arou "
"what a nice place. the restaurant is situated in a park next to a play ground and a observation tower. the pavilion is very light and fresh, though cosy. drinks and snacks were all very good"
nice modern cafe-style eatery with lovely sandwiches and cakes. right next to big park playground. for people that want a bit quiet and some wine there is a separate area.
"the food is delicious and healthy. i think they use organic products, mostly. and its not too expensive. there is a nice playground for kids. i think its a nice place for all ages. you can have a nice walk (with your dog) in the park. the environment is beautiful. most times i visited anafora there were a lot of families with children - what entails a certain amount of activity and noise. for me not the place to be, just to relax."
on a sunny saturday we enjoyed a delicious lunch in this restaurant. the staff is very friendly. the place is excellently located in a park near to a large playground  children of every age will enjoy.
"the location, in the middle of the park, is amazing. it is so relaxing, in the middle of nature. it creates a real holiday or sunday afternoon feeling. great for kids too. staff/service is professional. good snacks, but not exceptional."
"this restaurant, located in the middle of the maxima park in utrecht is great during a sunny day! theres a huge playground for kids nextdoor and there are plenty of lounging opportunitie "
"very beautiful place in the middle of a park , fantastic decor ,  good location good food and friendli staff !highly reccomend !!!! a++++"
very enjoyable dinner for the four of us at a waterside table. clearly this is a very popular spot for locals to meet and greet. our dinners were very good and the service was quick and efficient. we had called earlier to make a reservation and our request was honored. very accommodating staff and a beautiful location. parking is available across the street.
"de punt is a friendly and authentic brasserie where you can enjoy some simple food. the place has a really nice and old fashioned vibe and it seems like a place where local people have a drink and chat with their friends. the food is nothing fancy, but since it is very cheap, you get great value for money. we had the burger, a salad with goat cheese and the children went for fries and pizza. we had a pleasant time!"
de punt is located at the river angstel and has a nice outdoor terrace at the watersi 
during my stay in the netherlands i visited this place twi 
"we stumbled on this place, what a find.   staff were really friendly, nice atmosphere, only had lunch but pizza was lovely, went back again next day.   if visiting amsterdam well worth a look."
"it was a walking distance from the hotel i stayed. good food, generous portions, good service. enjoyed."
"the buffet was very good! delicious chinese dishes, friendly staff. the place was comfy and very clean. buffet price was very convenient."
one can enjoy their meals everyday without being fed up. the food is very fresh and tasty. you feel like going on and on and on. but there is a time to stop! you cant stop the taste bud s though. great meal experience.
"we have never had so much choice in dutch pancakes. sweet, savory, cheese and special dutch pancakes. they are about 12 inch in diameter, thinner than breakfast pancakes and thicker than crepes. you will be loving them. if you cannot choose; try the sweet and savory 50/50 combo."
"this pancake restaurant is located neer de maarsseveense plassen, a well know recreation area. they have a wide variety of pancakes form sweet to hearty. we both had pancake bolognese. delcious and well filled. service is friendly and quick enough. prices are a bit high but it is worth while there are many children vut the place is very cosy."
staf is really friendly and the food is lovely. just a classic dutch pancake house with s big variatie of pancakes
"its unbelievable how many different crepes they prepare here. name it, they have i "
this is a very good pancake house situated near de maarsseveense plassen. nice view over the water. pancakes are of good quality and warm. place is a bit noisy because of the many children who luke a pancake. one half our is enough. o yes and a huge free parking space.
"we went here on a sunny saturday afternoon in august. the place was really busy. however, there is plenty to do for the kiddies, making the atmosphere more relaxed. unfortunately, we were plagued by wasps."
"a more modern style pancake restaurant at the maarsseveense plassen. very busy, lots of kids, lots of pancakes to choose from. nice play area for kids as well. if youre with children this is a perfect place for a quick pancake dinner."
"my boyfriend and i visited tonight, not expecting much but wanting something fast and easy as we had been travelling all day and didnt feel that great. however, we were really, really pleasantly surprised. the service was friendly and attentive without being overbe.overbearing. the location was easy to find and had parking easily available on nearby street "
"due to a visit from a dutch friend from the states, we went to tante liens for take away indonesian food (rice table). they also have about 10 tables of which 6 were already reserved. the restaurant, take away opens from 16:00 onwards and we think is the best place together with toko mitra at lange viestraat 2 in utrecht to order your rice table (3-4 options or order separate dishes. be aware that indonesian food can be spicy (pedis) and consult the staff before ordering. their sate gambing (lam) and ayam blado (balinese chicken) are heaven. enjoy!"
"this little gem in the center of maarssen is a lovely restaurant. it is not up-scale or posh; there is a counter for take-away orders, and there are only around 10 tables to sit at. the service is friendly, but the main reason to visit this place is the food. authentic indonesian food. i highly recommend one of the rijsttafels, a meal that consists of several small dishes all served at once for sharing with the table. there is something for everyone, from spicy chicken to tofu and beans with coconu "
"very nice, friendly and good quality indonesian food - for sit down dinner or take-away. excellent flavors and choice of dishes for a very reasonable price."
the restaurant lay out is functional and simple.the food can also be ordered as takeaway (great if you have an holiday apartment or if you eat at hom 
"whenever you are in the vicinity of utrecht, maarssen to be excact, and you have a craving for some great ol indo food, i can absolutely recommend tante liens. its a cozy and small restaurant where you can either sit or takeaway. in both cases you will not be dissapointed. the food is traditional and divers, with all the classics off course. all there is left to say from me to you is selamat makan!"
"went here a couple of times. i usually go here for takeaway food but it is also a cosy place for in dining. friendly staff, good food and plenty to choose from the menu. would recommend!"
"in a country where you can find many indonesian restaurants of generally good quality; tante liens positively stands out. the setting and atmosphere are between casual and oriental (they do takeaway food as well). their rice table is just sublime. despite their very reasonable prices and low profile, the many different tastes guarantee a culinary journey. just superb. will come back. "
"such pleasure to eat here! the food is great and so is the service. we both enjoyed the indonesian menu for 2. nice and cosy restaurant in a small village, not far from utrecht."
they did improve the dishes which were goo salty for my taste so it is excellent now. cosy dining in a family oriented place. take a way possibilities
a very nice little restaurrant in the centre of historic maarssen. very nice indonesiamn decration. very friendly young staff. foof is of very good quality. you can eat frm cheap to mid ranged prices.
nice and original food served to go or in a restaurant. locals and foreigners claim it to be the most original in the utrecht area.
"this is an interesting case where taste of food is more important than looks. when you enter this is a kind of take away, but it has a sitting down part as well and the food is simple but nicely cooked. english speaking is limited in this village restaurant, so there is a lot of fingerpointing and guessing to do. a very interesting experience!"
"lots of choices, big portions, kids friendly, fast service, what else you need? and if you want to have slightly fancy dinner you can do it in the restaurant next door"
"if we go for pancakes, we typically go to de gloeiende gerrit. the size of the pancakes and toppings are very good. the specials are interesting, tasty and value for money. you can also build your own pancake. if you want to go for pancakes with a group or just together for a quick diner, this restaurant is a good choice. the kids love the special playground as well."
"really great pancakes, lovely staff. you can create your own pancake or choose one from the menu. you can also choose one of two batters. with of without children, this place serves pancakes for all"
great pancakes and good staff. the sphere is authentic and great for children. they have a separate place in the attic for the children to play. thanks pancakes are delicious and they use good quality ingredients
great restaurant for pancakes in all sizes and flavors. further friendly staff and a good atmosphere.
"we have a pancake lunch with 16 persons (incl 8 kids 1-11 years old). great tablespot, good pancakes with enough topping, great play addic for kids (from 2 yeas and older). great service! location is in a urban living area, bud nice and green surroundigs."
"lovely restaurant with nice terrass in spring/summer. great food, nice staff and atmosphere. we really like bij bart"
"a spacious, high ceiling restaurant (nicely decorated) with a limited menu. but we enjoyed the dishes we had. taco‚Äôs with vegetarian gamba‚Äôs and a good burger. as a starter a plate with several small starters. very friendly waiters, it took a bit to long before dishes arrived. but we will go there again!"
"lucky with some a nice september sun, having a drink and some snacks on their outside terrace. the bourgondische bitterballen are quite nice, lots of proper meat inside, very tasty. service is good and friendly. enjoyable visit."
"nice terras, good service, small menu but verry good food! price/quality is also good. also the inside of de restaurant is modern end cosy."
"limited menu, however a very good quality and a very good service. menu is limited, but adjusted regulary enough to keep a returning guest very interested."
good choice of pancakes reasonable price myself i would prefer a thinner pancake then the second pancake would be completly eten.
"popped in whilst cycling through netherland, only had a coffee and chocolate brownie, but it was fab, the brownie was delicious!! friendly staff even topped my water bottle up with ice!! (it was redders!)"
"had dinner here with my fianc√©e last night. fantastic food, great service, really friendly staff. best. steak. ever. üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä"
"there where two dishwashers in the restaurant. i saw them cleaning the forks, knifes and spoons. when i was eating it was very clean so i was very pleased with that. so i think they should get a promotion. it was on friday btw. besides the dishwashers, the food was very good aswell. "
"super service , one of the best burgers i ever had and very relaxing environment. i was never in spankenburg."
"we visited this with dutch friends for lunch...3 of us had the fish platter , a trio of fish and i had the spanish burger....the food was very good and we had no complaints ..the service was good too and the staff were welcoming. it wasnt cheap though."
"stopped by for dinner a d loved the food and service, don.t miss this food if you are in the area. the ice cream with berries and mint leaves with a chocolate are not to be missed."
"visited here for a family lunch today, 6 adults and 5 children! the food was superb, the service fantastic and in a lovely relaxed setting. cannot fault this restaurant and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to others."
"this is the 2nd time ive visited here. what an absolute treat. we went without booking on friday afternoon and it was almost empty. this restaurant should be packed full, its top not "
"call it a tourist in your own country. i had never been to spakenburg until i received an invitation from a good friend for lunch. spakenburg has traditionally been a fishing village located on the zuiderzee until the construction of the afsluitdijk. since then, the fishing fleet has shrunk, but fish processing and trade still play an essential role in the local economy. the restaurant is located in the center of the village, and parking is free of charge on the schansplein behind the restaurant. upon entering, we received a very friendly welcome and decided to take a table at the front near the window. we were pleasantly surprised by the quality and creativity of the dishes. if you are visiting this beautiful authentic village, this is definitely recommended."
prima restaurant. schone tpoiletten. tafels met linnenvoor de lunch. vriendelijk personeel. food was excellent. clean restrooms. kind personnel. clean teras. nice menu card. good selection of wines. lunch was served by personnel who had gloves on. very hiegenic.
we were lucky enough to get a table and ate outside with the wonderful backdrop of this beautiful fishing village. (booking is advised as it is busy and popul 
"you will find this cozy restaurant smack in the center of the picturesque fisher town of spakenburg. fresher fish still swim. excellent wine selection. perfect for families, couples and for business lunch/dinner too."
"we were staying at centerparcs and took the ferry to spakenburg. had (tripadvisor) researched in advance where we wanted to have lunch , so knew where we were aiming for ! and we were definitely not disappointed. we focused on fish dishes and, despite being fish lovers and having eaten fish in may countries, these flavours were a new experience. the lady chef certainly knows how to create a fiesta on a plate and how to get all the elements dancing together in perfect sink. it wasnt cheap, but it was definitely worth the money. fabulous quality, seasonal ingredients, great combinations. we really enjoyed the food and would highly recommend."
"the food was amazing. i was taken there for a business dinner close to the office. this was a big surprise. half the table had seafood dishes - including me and it was amazing. the capriccio, veal and steak dishes looked great and the others really liked it. the restaurant was cozy and elegant. the service was friendly and good. this is in a small former fishing village with still many antique dutch boats. the cheese plate for desert was very good. i had a very nice organic local pilsner and food good grenache/syrah by the glass wine. even the bread was a very tasty sourdough. it is a truly great place. you need a car to go there. it is worth the trip."
"i visited here on the last day of my first visit to holland with my husband and his oma, it was the perfect way to end the trip!! the food was incredible, i had the shrimp croquettes which are amazing. the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the decor was lovely. i honestly cannot say good enough things about this place. cant wait to go back! "
very good restaurant that offers you a very good dinner and some good wines too. by far the best restaurant spakenburg has to offer
"a really recommendated restaurant with a fine qualification in the gault millau. especially the fish is good. also the location of the restaurant is perfect, espacially on the terrace."
this was a great experience of dutch culture in a quaint fishing village with an ancient history. the old sailing ships outside only add to the ambiance. the restaurant itself appears to be freshly remodeled. wait staff were very friendly and service oriented. this type of dinning is meant to enjoy your company and without being rushed. the food was great and presentation was also a wonderful part of the meal. make time to tour the town but get there early because the sidewalks roll up early. we are going back for sure.
"enjoyed a nice lunch in the sun. the restaurant is located at the little harbour of spakenburg, a small village. when cycling, most routes go through here, so you will do well to plan your stop he "
"went here unannounced on a saturday night on what seems to be spakenburgs favourite nighttime district. got a wall table at the back. excellent fish soup and bouillabaise. the sea bass was a bit spongy. the accompanying vegetables, such as jerusalem artichoke and other non-mainstream greens, were undercooked. service was ok."
"we have eaten here many times and sometimes you would expect in other restaurants a bad day or lesser quality. however not in this restaurant!! the quality is always at a very high standard and difficult to beat, even for star restaurants. it is a cozy and not too large restaurant, with lots of space between tables. the fish is the best of the best and cannot be any fresher. ( and i ate a lot around the world ) the staff is also very nice and polite and always with a smile. winelist is pretty large with some nice surprises on  "
ooh i love this place. the service is great. the waitress heard i was english and immediately conversed in english. i had the carpaccio again as i hadnt stopped dreaming about the first time i ate it there 2 years ago. it wasnt exactly the same but delicious nonetheless. the rest of the family were pleased with their orders. ill be back again next may!
"the better restaurant in spakenburg. perfect for business meetings, lunches and intimate dinners. good food, not to expense (upper side), friendly service (but amateuristic at times), nice location in the center, but good parking available in the are "
"overlooking the market, and the harbour from the terrace outside, a nice upscale restaurant in spakenbu "
"ive been here two years ago, but this time i can say that the food was fantastic. the atmosphere is nice and the people are kind. i loved the deer meat and the jumbo."
"the entree of the restaurant is promising. modern furniture in an old building can be a challenge but here it works. the lunch menu shows a variety of cold and warm fish plates. all of them look great and the prices are acceptabel. the staff is friendly though not very professional as the empty large teacups were left on the table during the lunch, leaving not much space for the large dishes."
"not very cheap, but the food is worth every euro ! nice attentive waitresses."
good service with great staff. the food is great and the location at the waterside is really lovely.
"what a little gem there is here. we discovered it by chance and so glad we stopped. we spent a wonderful few hours on the side of the canal, enjoying a meal and music with the locals. find it if you can, just make sure you allow quite a few hours to sit and enjoy it."
"i am coming to woudsend and heeg since 1964. de watersport ist an unique restaurant, which i have visiten minimum 30 times. eating.    there was always perfect! pure last visite was on 06/25/2018 : great !!!"
"perfect location next to the bridge and facing the canal (and sheltered from the n & w winds), so great for people watching and boat watching. we enjoyed a lovely impromptu sunday lunch of open sandwiches - i had the goats cheese, rocket and walnut with honey, and elaine the pulled pork with salad. both were flavoursome and ample, and the brown bread was very fresh and light - and all accompanied by a good beer and a lovely chilean sauvignon blanc, and friendly and helpful service. really hit the spot!"
we were out and about on our bikes and decided to stop here for lunch on a sunday as it was by the canal and in the sun. the service was good as was the food. great spot even if you only have time for a coffee.
my family live in woudsend and when i visit this is the first place i like to  
windmills are amazing and having a koffie & broodje kroket in a windmill is pretty awesome.  the windmill is old and bears my surname...i claim it as my own üòâ friendly staff... it is a must if you like windmills.
"this restaurant is located in an authentic mill, were they actually grind the grain and bake pancakes with it. their applepie has been chosen as best in the region."
"at this ijssalon (icecreamparlor) you can choose from a great variety of home made icecream, really delicious! also a good choice for your coffee or tea, with a mini-icecream on the side!"
"for my birthday we had a lunchbuffet, it was really great! two soups, salads, sandwiches and roles, fruit etc. everything fresh and tasting great. i got a lot of compliments from my guests!"
my son and i had just completed a 20 mile bike ride and were looking for some refreshment and a cool place to s 
"nice little restaurant in the centre of vaassen. no haute cuisine, but good simple food (its schnitzel-paradise). pleasant staff. good value for money. would go there again."
ignore the older review saying the coffee was bad here. it definitely isnt and was one of the best on our holid 
"great atmostphere,  excellent food, friendly service and very good value for money.  had one of the best spare ribs i have ever had,  and the cordon-bleu was outstanding.  highly recommended... worth a trip off the highway to find this gem."
"me and my mrs went here after work and after the very friendly staff had seated us, we enjoyed picking the meals that we wanted from a very promising menu. when the starters came i was excited and then i had the best pull pork wraps of my life, super lekker, all the dishes were amazingly tasty but to be honest i can‚Äôt remember anything other than the pork wraps! "
"simply fantastic. the place is actually in a green zone, full of trees and nature. the wooden decoration is quite original. also the food is fresh and quite good. you have free parking and also outdoors tables to enjoy your meal. 100 % appealing."
"the waitstaff makes this place 5 star. welcoming, gracious, friendly.  they really do a great job.  menu is small, well constructed meals.  interior is found items country chic.  outdoor terrace in front, enclosed terrace at the rear.  adequate parking.  both lunch and dinner service."
"beautiful and interesting establishment, very friendly and helpful service, the food (we tried only the soups) is ok."
i had been there several times and i always received the best. the food was really delicious and the service was great. do not hesitate to go there if you want to enjoy a really nice time.
"we came to town for a conference, ate here on the first night and came back for the remaining three nigh "
delicious cosy and fairly priced country style restaurant. service is amazing. added to my favorites.
"we were looking for a place for lunch on our way home from a short vacation in the netherlands. selecting an unknown restaurant is a bit bleak business in the netherlands, because mostly you will find far too busy outdoor seating, indifferent staff, waiting times of biblical proportions, mediocre food, and eye-watering bills. therefore, restaurant de tolboom was a pleasant surprise. restaurant de tolboom is situated in a historic renovated farm house. ample parking is available next to the building. the outdoor tables under the parasols are beckoning. the restaurants has a surprisingly larger selection than pancakes. salads, sandwiches and hot dishes are on the menu, but also pancakes of course. and draft birra moretti is available. attentive and hospitable waitresses were in function on the day we visited. the food was tasty and the bill was not cheap, but for dutch restaurants reasonable. restaurant de tolboom was a big hit and i have added the restaurant to my short list of worthy dutch restaurants. a well deserved five point rating."
"we were merely passing through the region whilst avoiding heavy traffic due to a severe accident on the highway. being just past noon and feeling a little hungry, we decided to stop at this renovated farm. my god! this place is awesome! they have a very cozy and quiet terrace in the back, and with temperatures of about 25 degrees we chose of course to sit outsid "
"our family‚Äôs favorite pancake house . they serve real authentic dutch pancakes . the pancakes are big and really filling. you can choose savory or sweet pancakes. i loved the speciale boer pacake( farmers pancake ) which has bacon, cheese & mushroom."
nice place for family with children. theres a big playground and we sat at a separate table in the woods. with a roof. see picture. not expensive and friendly staff.
"we love pancakes ... thats a fact! and these pancakes have been delicious but on a very different type compared to the pancakes served in the upstairs in amsterdam. these are the type of pancakes you love after a long day working / hiking / exploring. thick, very tasty and definetly short of calories. we had three (bacon & cheese, ham, cheese and pineapple, apple and bacon) and all five of us were very full afterwards! something was even left for the next da "
"we had breakfast with a group of 10 at lounge3, the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast was amazing and great value for money. highly recommend going for breakfast here and will be back one day for lunch or dinner!"
"my boyfriend and i went to lounge3 for dinner. the restaurant was busy, but the service was quick and the waiter very friendly. we decided on the dish of the day - an entrecote with salad, fries and a garlic sauce and everything was perfectly cooked and tasted excellent! i highly recommend this place!"
"cosy place, right in the centre of little village voorthuizen. modern, lounge stylish decoratief, with a veranda for those who want to have a smoke. quality food, not particular fancy, but fair and good value for money. extensive beer list with local and foreign beers. try their kaasplankje or wineplankj "
history is very interesting. you can walk around yorself or join the group with tourguide. the tourguide is very pasionate to tell stories. nice combi with visit to muiderslot.
when we were there it was busy (round the island swimming event) so the service was challenged however it was a nice day and we were not in a hurry. we sat outside and chatted with other visitors so time past quickly. our lunch was very tasty and healthy and the fresh mint tea was a joy. it would be easy to critique the place but i suspect the team behind the scenes are volunteers or supporters of this netherlands historic site. we enjoyed our experience and have been in far worse type places and paid a lot more!
"last summer, a few dinners were organised again at the old defence fort island pampushout. it is tiny and located in between muiden & almere. a boat from the organisation will take you there, you get on at ijburg, near amsterdam, but only if you have made a reservation in advance. one advice, dutch summers are nice but the weather can change rapidly or it can be very cool on the water, so best advice would be, to bring something to keep you warm. when we arrived on the island, we got a little tour and a guide told us a bit about the history of the island, which is quite interesting, there is definitely more to it, than meets the eye. then after you have been given some time, to walk around and explore the island, you can make your way to the restaurant. there are different places where you can sit, inside or outside. the evening works in a self-service kind of way and you get your drinks and food with a number that is given to you in the beginning of the evening. you can take as much as a like / crave for- it is all included in the price, apart from the drinks of course. food is simple, but very nice and varies from meat, fish to vegetarian options. at the end, they open a dessert buffet and you can get whatever you like plus a nice cup of coffee before you make your way to the boat again. the sunset is beautiful out here and you feel one with nature in a way. all and all, this was a very nice evening that we all enjoyed very much. it is a night out, but very different from your ordinary dinner at a restaurant. it is a mini adventure but in a comfortable way. sadly and understandably, these dinners are only organised in the summer and like i said, you will need to reserve in advance. it is good for couples to have a romantic dinner but also with friends, family or with your kids."
have had a great diner for a small price. lovely terras in the garden. great servants. fine food to. nice and cosy old- fashioned restaurant to have diner in a relaxed environment.
"i enjoyed a delicious family dinner in the main dining room. the restaurant is cozy, and the flower arrangements were amazin "
"looks, feels and most likely is a family restaurant for the locals. menu only in dutch, but the server explained everything in english :) would recommend over the tourist traps in center of muider"
"this is a great restaurant in a nice village in netherlands. the service, the food, and atmosphere were excellent. the mushroom soup was top-notch as was the white chocolate dessert. the red wine by the glass was fairly priced and quite good. i was really excited they offered fondue as a main dish since i am vegetarian. although it had way too much white wine in it, it was a nice attempt. i would definitely return again as the food overall was very good value and of very good quality. the service was definitely of a high standard as well."
"we found this restaurant during a weekend visit to muiden and ended up going back on the second evening. the fillet steak was fabulous, perfectly cooked and very reasonably priced at 12 euros. the manager made a very good attempt at translating the menu for us and made us feel very welcome. the only downside was the portion of chips was a little on the small side if you only have one course - ok if you have 3 courses though. there was also wild boar, shnitzel and fish on the menu."
i love this bar/restaurant!  its a great place to have a drink and the food is pretty good too.  i had the cheeseburger and it was fantastic.
"lovely spot open all day with great food, drink and atmosphere! the wings brought me back home and the salads are huuuge"
"my son lives in diemen and he took me there for a couple of beers on our way home. i was pleasantly surprised as this is a really good pub, great beers, nice food, the lo "
great people. great drinks. food is nice. very cozy and relaxing. stop by if you are around. less stress and dirt around here :)
"we had twice dinner in this restaurant/bar. service is friendly. the menu card is small but has something for everybody, so it does not need to be larger. we really enjoyed it and the prices are reasonable"
"very nice place, friendly staff , very tasty food and cozy home atmosphere . house specials are delicious! try autumn salad if you want to taste real dutch cuisine ! good for all ages!"
"the staff is really friendly and attentive; they even tried to speak my language ( which they succeeded... though i couldnt speak dutch) good place to meet friends, or just to have a few beers."
"this bar is fantastic. the staff are super friendly and helpful. their food is superb and its very affordable. the decor is absolutely beautiful. i love that you can eat, drink and play darts all at the same time. i would highly recommend cheers for people of any age."
"good quality food, but the owned fakes to be an italian .... h√® is not. using honest products and h√® had good teachers"
the restaurant is very nicely decorated and offers a good selection of light meals and beverages. service varies from from friendly to indifferent. meals are good and the atmosphere is relaxed and romantic.
"on sunday, december 16th, we took a nice walk with our friends in the beautiful nature of lopik and schoonhoven. our goal was to drink hot gluehwein at the little restaurant fausto at the end of the lekdijk in schoonhoven. when we arrived at 16.56 h at fausto‚Äôs it was almost closing time and the owners were cleaning up the machines and the restaurant. nut they opened up again and made us lovely hot gluehwein with orange parts. really goo "
"fausto moved to lekdijk oost 3!, which is a few hundred meters from mid-town schoonhoven next to the local harbor with a great view on the river. excellent for bikers. nice terrace for coffee, lunch or just having a drin "
"very nice place, friendly and super good cappuccino :).  great place to have a break, also with kids. they speak dutch, german, english and a bit french :)."
you do not have to go to italy for an excellent cappuccino. great resting point for bikers. all pastry super fresh and delicious! ...
"the food was delicious. theres a relaxed atmosphere. and the waiter is very good at making us feel comfortable. he was there when we needed something without being present all the time. when he noticed we left, he even held the door open for us."
this is probably one of the best restaurants ive ever been to. the food simple but elegant and tasteful. the dining area bold but not overbearing. the service personal and friendly but not unprofessional. a very good experience. i would gladly return for another meal. good job üëç
"keep up the great work! we are coming tomorrow to order the rest of the menu ... and beers !  what can i say ? if 10 is excellent , you deserve 20 !"
this is a very cosy place to enjoy good food at reasonable prices and accompanying wines of very good quality
the restaurant is in down town schoonhoven and it has excellent food. it has a very modern design. the only downside is that you dont have private space: everyone can hear what you are saying.
"good food, good atmosphere and good service!   we had todays special which was mussles. dessert was delicious: creme broulee with nougat ice cream and strawberries with parfait.  we were a family with two teenage girls, 15 and 17 which also enjoyed the place."
this small restaurant in the centre of schoonhoven ensures an  above average quality of food and drinks at a fair price.
"we had a joyful evening with friends and marvelous dinner at eethuys de waag. the presentation of the food was wonderful and the quality of high standard. also the the atmosphere exudes a rustic atmosphere. in short, an ideal place for an joyful evening."
"this was the first place we saw when we arrived in schoonhoven and walked into the village. we loved the way it looked and so, we decided it was worth a look. it is very cosy, now it is also decorated for christmas, making it even more gezellig "
we went there yesterday evening to have dinner following the suggestion of the owner of the b&b where we spent one night. nice place with very friendly people. good food !  to taste with a++++ thank you
"it is the 2nd i eat in this restaurant and excellent: taste, quantity and visual. i recommend. the price is reasonable."
"this is one of the best places to enjoy a typical dutch pancake or pannenkoek. they are so delicious! of course, you could also try the croquettes. another dutch speciality."
"nothing better than lunch on this terrace. perfectly balanced menu, cocktails and service. i go out of my way to visit if im within an hour of sluis. always deliver a 5* experience."
top notch chef with a partner who delivers a michelin experience in the dining room. it has become our favorite restaurant in sluis and we travel from brugge to eat when we can. lovely presentations and creative dishes. superb!
"a beautifully decorated restaurant with a very capable staff. the food was just off.  with or without the star, the quality is of a high standard restaurant."
"very good restaurant and according to the quality reasonable prices (christmas menu, wines included 98‚Ç¨) friendly service, delicious food and beautiful facility (an old bank), right in the center of sluis"
this was a first visit on a warm summer night and we sat on the terrace. the lovely atmosphere was only spoiled by the terrace being covered by quite ugly umbrellas that really did not fit the rest of the deco

"this is a michelin starred restaurants, so it comes with a price tag and with expectations... we were delighted to see there was a special offer which seemed a bit more affordable. unfortunately, im a bit upset with 2 mistakes invoking extra costs in their favor, making it next to impossible to leave with a bill of less than 90 euro a person: (1) the waiter trying to sell a sherry cream as being a petro ximines (and insisting his view was correct) / (2) when ordering the jubileum special menu, not being well explained what them main dish was like, and then - when having doubts about the disk - been given the impression that they would swap the disk ... except they forgot to mention there was an additional price-tag... also the typical amuse gueules you tend to get in these restaurants were missing and the extras that came with the coffee were not impressiv "
"visited by chance on a very hot day. √† la carte starter and main course - a true delight! the crab as a starter, well balanced contrast of asian flavours and as a main course lamb chops that were tender as butter and had a sohisticated smokey flavour. friendly staff and the limoncello cakes with the espresso are something to die for. a very warm thank you from us. and your gins are excellent, too."
"how smart to be open on monday when all restaurants in the region are closed! we ate here on monday, the monday night special (3 courses "
this restaurant has a very stylishly decorated interior with a separate lounge area for aperitifs. there is also outside space in a garden at the re 
amazing evening with colleagues! the food was fabulous and the wine was extraordinary! thanks for the great service as well!
we had a wonderfull evening with friends in a beautiful place. the staff was very kind and attentioned. the food was very good and the service of it excellent. some if us had a 3-dishes menue and the others had a 5-dishes menue. but everything was served right in time. by the way: thanks for the visit of the cellar üòâ
"second time in la trinit√©, but first time at their new location by the wate "
this is a must visit restaurant if your looking for the very best fine dining in a fantastic building with exceptional staff 
"since la trinit√©, in sluis, the netherlands, moved to their new building, along the waterfront in sluis, we paid several visits to this wonderful. restaurant.. the food is fantastic,everytime you can taste another menu of very high quality.the prices are acceptable for a michelin-starrestaurant. the r estaurant itself, is brandnew, very nice,, modern and open.there is a small, but beautiful garden outside, where customers can enjoy their aperitive. but what we can enjoy the most, is the open mind and the friendly way of handling from the lady of the house and the whole staff."
second time here and it wont be the last. we were once again very pleased with all dishes served. the appetizers gave the tone and all mains and deserts were flawless. wine list could present more international wines (non french). the prizes are correct! well be back
if you have the opportunity please take an apero in the lounge! always fresh food and excellent service!
"my wife took me there for my birthday yesterday and i loved it. the interior is smart but comfortable, the staff go out of their way to be helpful and the food is exactly what one expects from a michelin 1 star restaurant. we took the ten sations  menu - ten small different and creative dishes, but added the optional 11th dish of persian black pearl caviar. very nice and the slices of bread lightly fried in butter took me back to my childhood. the whole thing cost ‚Ç¨100 per person (including wine, water and coffee). try it!"
"due to traffic jams, we arrived one hour late, but were nevertheless welcomed as if nothing had happened. the champagne was accompanied by three wonderfull appetizers, of which the macaron was a prize winner. we had the 5-corse menu, reasonably prized at 70‚Ç¨. the seabass was perfect, the revised paella with nobashi shrimp succulent. the lamb was cooked to perfection. the munster chesse came in a bouillon of pear and was accompanied by a foie gras burger. very original! the mango was served with yoghurt, lemon and wasabi: refreshing!. coffee was accompanied with a variety of sweets. service was perfect and the affordable winelist offers a vaste choice of non-french wines."
"we were at la trinit√© at the occasion of the promotion dining with the stars which means that we had a set menu.the dishes were absolutely an experience with a mixture of flavours and aromas. none of the courses were disappointing. the reception by a distinguished lady, the waiters and the sommelier added to the pleasure. the restaurant was absolutely full ,yet the service was perfect as a michelin starred place is expected to be. we selected our wines from the extensive wine list and were not disappointed. a place to be recommended and in fact: better than one star."
"this is what michelin inspectors really contribute: a star to a real gastronomic heaven. the service, starting already with the simple pouring of a simple beer by the somelier was already masterful and done with passion. every morsel of the food - from amuse bouche to the petit fours- was of superb gastronomic quality. you feel the delight with every bite. the wine recommendation was also superb. a dream of a meal! second star on the way...?"
"loungy atmosphere, beautiful modern & cosy interior. very friendly staff!  wonderful food, splendid combinations, just perfect!"
"great food, perfect wine selection and the best host, evelyn..!! :) 4 th time here, and always perfect."
"having read recent reviews of this restaurant, we were apprehensive but our fears were unfounded. we found the menu, all 6 courses of it, tasty and interesting, with different contrasts. the accompanying wines were particularly well chosen. the service was faultless. the restaurant was half full on a monday night and my only gripe was that in these conditions, i would have preferred the tables to be allocated without everyone being next to one another."
"recommended by a friend, we had quite high expectations of this place and luckily they were all met. the quality of the food was excellent, even though personally i wouldnt have mind slightly bigger portions (ackowledging that i do have a healthy appetit "
"great, modern, inventive cuisine in a very nice atmosphere. fine wines and top quality ingredien "
"this is one of the places we always wanted to do...but there are so many fantastic restaurants in our region. but now...well certainly come back here more than once !! the food quality is unique, tha products are fresh and the tastes remain natural...but there are so many tastes to discover in every dish ! and yes...in this restaurant you can relax, no stiffness, you can laugh and enjoy. the combination of quality and service in this fantastic athmosphere is unique. really a must for every lover of life and gastronomy !!! thank you very much evelyne and francois !!"
"this restaurant proves that cooking is a real art : an outburst of hidden flavours and textures with a great respect for each ingredient. as far as the food is concerned, it ll be in the running for a second michelin star, no doubt about it. a must experience for foodies, appreciating refinement in preparation and serving. its impossible to describe all the dishes because their food touches all the senses a human being has got. a revelation ! of course, its pricy, but you cant prepare it yourself at home because its the result of a continuous research on flavours and textures that match wonderfully how bizarre they may seem. i certainly will go back to discover more."
"unbeatable for quality, style and ambiance in the west zeeuwse valanderen!  although they only have one star in my opinion this one even beats the other 2 star restaurants in the region."
"last week we had lunch at la trinit√© in sluis, great experience ! the interior, the staff, the quietness in the open kitchen, and last but not least the fantastic food, we will be back for more !"
"i enjoyed a wonderful four course dinner with perfect wine pairings on a recent sunday evening in september. from the warm greeting at the front door, the professional, but friendly, caring staff, the smart, elegant, comfortable room, the delicious food that seemed to have a satisfying surprise with every bit, to the small things the staff did to elevate the dining experience and the goodbyes at the end of the evening la trinite over delivered every step of the way. i absolutely loved this restaurant."
"in the heart of sluis you will find this beautiful gem! it all starts with a warm hearted welcome of maitre de salle and owner, you get a warm handshake to welcome you at la trinit√©. what a lovely way to make genuine contact with your custome "
got a cadeaubox and wanted to try this restaurant. the service was very good (although it was the servers first day) and the food was excellent. well come again when in the neighbourhood.
"we called in here not really knowing what we wanted to eat and we settled for a beer (well it was a hot day and we were thirsty) and some french fries to nibble on. the waiter was friendly and spoke good english. we waited only a few minutes before he took our order and was back 5 minutes later with 2 large plates full of french fries. the cost, 10 euros for 2 beers and 2 plates of french fries. the restaurant is situated in the street that runs parallel to the main shopping street and leads to the canal."
"we stayed for two nights at de lindenhoeve (beautiful room, modern and cozy, great bad and bathroom - üëåüèª); and had dinner and breakfast there too. the only thing theyve missed was ramazzotti, but all the rest was just fine))"
"one of the best places in sluis. somewhat special waiters, you have to get used to, but compared to the rest in sluis friendly staff. good foor, allthough not very cheap."
"love this place, had coffe and hot chocolate with kids, really tasty. overall nice warm place. cant say anything about food."
had lunch on the large terrace in the back. looks like the place had a major refurbishment since the last time we visited a few years a 
we went to the restaurant/tearoom a few times during our recent stay in sluis. each time we had the same waiter. he remembered us from the first visit which was nice and he was extremely pleasant and friendly. we only went for drinks and cakes but found each visit enjoyab 
"i just went in for some tea and coffee, but they have a lot more to offer. for us, its the perfect stop for a small treat. the setting is absolutely beautiful and their service excellent. recommended!"
"great food , perfect wine selection and the best host, evelyn..!:) 3 time here and always perfect. the quality of the food was excellent! well certainly be back in the future."
"we had twice lunch there, during our holidays the week from 8th of june 20 "
"i think its one of the other best restaurants in town. and maby some get pissed. but thats the way of life. where in china(david bowie) crisis. the owners are hardworking people . having a nice parking. and aswell a nice place, if you like birds and that kind of thinks. and the food is very good .chapeau....im liken it."
"took a late lunch, swift service, cold and fresh beers, and ample wine list, food was good, tasty and flavorsome, served by joyce. a good choice for tapas"
"for us the terrace of kaai 10 stood out from the rest and looked inviting, with the green bushes and cosy furniture. great views and bathed in sunlight. with covid-19 in mind very practical idea with the menu printed on the paper place maths. the menu, besides classics, offers a wide variety of local specialities for lunch, dinner and dessert. we ordered one lunch special (salmon) the house burger and great coffee and delicious pancakes for dessert. despite the crowd, the service was very friendly and quick and the food very good. would definitely visit again!"
"i was visiting sluis and it started to rain and it was round lunch time, i had a choice of restaurants to pick from but picked kaai 10 and i was glad i did. the service by my server was excellent she helped me with translation from the menu which was in dutch, a language i do not speak. i had soup of the day which was courgette which i had never had before but it was good. for main course i had the club sandwich which was very big, i was not able to eat all of it unfortunately. i would certainly got to this restaurant again if i was in sluis."
had a great meal! it was truly fantastic! we opted for the suggestion of the day while my wife had the mussels! what a nice piece of fish for an amazing price. add a very friendly service in a really nice setting and you have a wonderfull experience for a good price!
we have been going there for years. a small menu but everything is excellent. they are especially good with the fish dishes but the vegetables are done so carefully that they are a treat in themselves. the staff have changed over the years but they are always attentive and polite. 
"petit par la taille, enoooorme par la qualite de ses moules, elles valent le grand detour !  small in size but huge for the top quality of its mussels ; this is definitely worth a long detour !"
"we had a very nice diner in this cosy restaurant with naturally friendly waiters. started with a screwdriver (with freshly squeezed orange juice !! üëç). all the starters were very good, i would certainly recommend the vitello tonato and the scallops. as main course we had an excellent selection of clearly fresh fish with excellent vegetables and different sauces for each fish, very nice. personally i would have preferred a bit more variety in vegetables and no chips. service was good but we had to wait a bit too long for the main course. overall a very good restaurant though üòÄüëã"
"our first visit ! nice experience. fresh food , good wine combined with a excellent service. what else..."
we had fish at kaai 10 and it seemed to be swimming out of the sea right onto our plate. very delicious...
"our third visit from u.k. as we consistently get good service, good atmosphere and very good food from this restaurant. we never visit brugge/sluis without visiting kaai 10."
"although the menu did look promising and both the service and the interior were really good, we just had tea. but even that was nicely presented."
this was a very nice experience in a fairly small restaurant on the local quay (hence the name kaai 10) in the touristy town of slu 
"we always visit here when in sluis, i recommend the lamb its absolutely delicious, followed by the chocolate pudding, which is baked to order. inside it has dark panelling and beautiful chandeliers with lots of candles, creating a very charming atmosphere. staff are always helpful and attentive."
"one of my preferred restaurants when visiting sluis, the well prepared fish plate, the excellent house wine, the atmosphere everything is ok"
"recommended to visit this restaurant by a restaurant owner in bruges who goes here regularly. pleasant atmosphere mainly local people using the restaurant which is usually a good sign. there was a good choice of food, a before 6p.m. menu then after 6 plus a comprehensive vegetarian menu. reasonably priced we ate the spaghetti bolognese which was very nice. staff were very friendly & helpful, definitely recommend & go again when in sluis."

"arrived here on a busy summer evening, outside seating area completely filled with people to enjoy the last of a sunny day. after our apero inside, a waiter made sure the next available table outside was ours. we tried the shrimps with pesto, tuna filet and mussels. all were perfectly cooked, service was very friendly. you can not expect anything more from this kind of pub food."
"we stopped here for lunch on a boys road trip. food was very good. had a club sandwich which was too much for one, very generous portions. staff were very helpful especially with my less than limited dutch!"
"to go back in august/september, we had a lovely meal here on the evening sunday 26 may. the service was great and we didnt get to see the chef but she definitely deserves praise, the food was fantastic. very friendly and a joy to use"
"we were drawn to this place after walking passed and seeing a couple eating a seafood platter. we ordered the same thing and had one of the best meals ever. the mixed seafood platter was fantastic. the entire meal, service, desserts, were all brilliant. would highly recommend it. we loved how they bring you bread in a paper bag."
"very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. we thought it would be cheap, quick fast food. it was cheap and quick but delicious and great quality. the kids meals are great value, a drink, main, lolly and a great toy for ‚Ç¨7. the staff were friendly and spoke good english. couldn‚Äôt have been more helpful. a hidden gem."
"had the fish burger, and the wife had the soya burger. both very good. staff speak perfect english. and for just ‚Ç¨4.50 each, it was real value for money."
"we sat on the terrace and ordered burgers, chips and drinks. the service was quick and friendly, the food excellent. fast food at its best."
"i have been a customer here several times over the past ten years or so and have never been disappointed with the food or service. you can eat in or take away, also has beer and soft drinks. reasonable prices. very good."
the waitress was really nice and friendly: a great place for a short break! the french fries are good and the burgers delicious!

"super restaurant. competively priced, spotlessly clean, great service and food. all cooked within view of seating area. highly recommended and more than enough variety."
"visiting sluis, the netherlands we had to try the local cuisine which in this case was fries and mayo. they actually offer fries with about 20 other toppings, but in this neck of the wood, mayo is king! they were really, really good! a nice jupiler beer helped them digest. we would eat here again."
"i have eaten here on several occasions and it never disappoints, always good food, good service and made to feel welcome, and at a reasonable price.. credit cards not taken though, but cash-point available across the square. would recommend and will dine here again when back in rozenburg."
"stopped in rozenburg and came across ‚Äòla calenta‚Äô. there is a great selection of food on the menu, with meat and fish dishes and tapas. i had several tapas dishes which were delicious. the service was very good and quick. i would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting near by. hope to come back."

"my wife and i visited this restaurant at 14:00 to reserve a table for dinner at 18:30 that night. we were offered any of the tables and chose one (no 15) in the window. on arriving at 18:30, we were annoyed to find a couple having drinks at our table. furthermore, the waitress just shrugged her shoulders and said find another table. all the other window tables were occupied so we had to choose a table further back in the room which was satisfacto "
"very nice place, clean and friendly staff. portions were big, maybe little too big of you are not starwing. recommendations for this place!"
"my partner and i visited this restaurant for the first time on a rainy sunday evening in july whilst on vacation in the area. we thought it would be quiet but it seems the local population all eat out on sunday and it was packed. despite not having reserved a table, we were warmly welcomed and seated within minutes. the decor is over the top in an amusing way, all fake greek columns and trailing vines, the staff are efficient and friendly, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals. we both had one of the many combination dishes of grilled greek meat specialities, accompanied by tzatsiki, chips and salad. with garlic bread for starters, half a litre of red wine, coffees and the biggest measure of metaxa brandy ive ever seen, the bill came to about 52 euros for two. great value."
"lovely place, great food, very good service. the atmosphere they created makes you feel like youre in greece :-)"
amazing lunch at a wonderful restaurant with great owners.    fantastic value and simply amazing food.    we were lucky enough to have an experience where to chef made what he wanted from anything he chose.  just incredible.   thank you so much.
we went with friends from the area.  a great little place with fantastic service and the food quality was excellent.  definitely one to mark for a visit when you are in this area.

"our group of ten colleagues from six countries (china, singapore, usa, uk, the netherlands, brazil) were lucky enough to spend a beautiful june evening on the patio enjoying a five course menu with wine pairings as part of the restaurant‚Äôs fifth anniversary celebration. the service was gracious, including from the owners, and the food and wine were outstanding. white asparagus, lobster, turbot, beef tartare, hereford beef, berries, chocolates and more. our very international group all thought it was an outstanding meal. our european headquarters is nearby and we will most certainly add le jardin to our small circle of wonderful local restaurants. "
"a lovely location with fine dining outside. we had a large group and chose the set menu with win pairings which was 55 euros, an unbelievable value. presentation and flavors of the food match any michelin 1 star restaurant in my view. the wine pairings were excellent and for foodies in particular a good experienc "

"this lovely restaurant, as the name suggests, builts up the mood like the garden, perking up your senses. the food that we tried was in a group, hence we had more than hald a dozen dishes ordered by our group & each & every dish came upto our expectation. the service always helpful, with a smile, made the whole experience even more enhanced. donot think that this comes on a budget! be prepared to shell out your euros here, but then its worth every penny, as we say!"

schipluiden is a fantastic small town few km from delft that deserves for sure a visit. indigo is a perfect place for the character of schipluiden. the service is very good and quick. there is a great selection of wines and bee 
"nestled on the singel in schipluiden, this quirky restaurant offers well presented organic meals. daily poultry, beef, fish, pork or vegetarian options change according to chefs inspiration and availability. relaxed, friendly yet professional waitrons add to dining experience. a good selection of wines are offered to compliment courses. in summer the terrace opens onto the canal in quaint schipluiden and in winter there is a lovely cosy ambience."
"we ate here last night as a group of four and had a wonderful evening.  we had the chefs surprise and were delighted by each and everyone of our courses.  good ambience and friendly, informative, attentive (if rather slow) service."
we arrived in schipluiden and found this lovely restaurant was just metres away from our b & b. this building had a former life as a church then as a garage and now it is a licenced restauran 
went here to celebrate anniversary of a good friend 
"cycled from delft to this restaurant . had an excellent lunch on the sunny back terrace. very tasty, interesting salad (with flowers) and sandwiches made with organic produce , which is the restaurants main selling point. the restaurant has a plot at the back where it grows herbs etc. not expensive .staff very helpful and friendly. restaurant set in an attractive old building"
it is located at a very nice spot. we really enjoyed coffee and tea. the terrace is nicely located close to the waterside.mfriendly staff.
"we did visit indigo often but just to drink some coffee. because of a very good review in the local newspaper we decided to go for dinner and we were not desappointed at all. they have a 3 course menu for 27,50‚Ç¨ and you can choose from the whole menucard. we only took a main course and it was very good, very tasty. they do offer goose on the menu and my husband did choose, it was also very tasty and quit a new experience and probably we both will choose it next time. indigo offers most biological vegtables, meat, cheese and so on. worth a visit."
"only *local* produce, so adding to a greener world ... and cooks doing a miracle with the ingredients. of course its always a seasonal menu ... and were loving i "
"we had the surprise menu, an appetizer and three courses. taste is excellent, the menu has variation and imagination built in. the price was quite reasonable."
the restaurant used to be a church and then later a garage so the setting is special ! extremely cosy ! staff is very friendful ! bio restaurant with ingredients grown in own back garden !! brewn coca cola is nice. the food is excellent ! better than we have ever had in belgium and affordable prices ! we will come back fo sure ! loved it ...
indigo is one of my favorite restaurants by f 
"our second visit to paviljoen t middelpunt, for dinner. the restaurant is located on a nice spot at the waterfront in schipluiden. ample free parking is available along the dorpsstraat, opposite the total petrol station. we noticed that the interior was spruced up since our last visit. service of the staff was polite, modest and dedicated. waiting times were just fine. we enjoyed a three course menu. i had chosen fish dishes for starter and main course. the dishes were well prepared and flavours were perfectly balanced. the shared side dishes of fries and salad were a bit skimpy for two persons. unfortunately, prices are of an ambitious level, not uncommon in dutch restaurants, but on a high level compared with neighbouring european countries. fortunately, paviljoen t middelpunt is active on the voucher web site of social deal, where discounted vouchers can be obtained, making the bill far more palatable."
"lovely waitress .. first impressions count! well located, just off the highway and at the entrance of the village, but _at_ _the_ _waterside_. they forgot one order, but the it was a very warm day ..  a place to remember."
"to be realistic, in the dutch restaurant landscape, prices at paviljoen t middelpunt are moderate, but seen in an more european scene, prices are high, compared with similar establishments in west european countries. but enough of that. we were of course armed with discounted internet vouchers, indispensable in the quest for value for money. paviljoen t middelpunt in schipluiden is situated nicely on the bank of the small river gaag. the wood and glass building with areas for outdoor seating is very inviting. parking is free along the road. the interior is simple and clean. one point of critic is, that an additional door to the toilet area would greatly improve the atmosphere. behind a large counter the open kitchen is situated; a very dedicated and competent chef is presiding over the pots and pans. the counter doubles also for obtaining take-away food. my three course menu consisted of carpaccio (unfortunately the dutch variety, with loads of salad leaves heaped on the beef slices. but when i had eaten away the salad leaves, the beef was tender and tasty. even the capers were rinsed!); the main course was tuna steak with fries and roasted potatoes (well prepared and tasty; tuna steak is one of the most difficult dishes to prepare) and the dessert was some sort of chocolate and ice cream with meringue contraption (delicious). so high marks for the chef. the table service was done competently by a well educated waitress; however, without real hospitality. generally speaking the visit to paviljoen t middelpunt was very satisfactory and memorably."
it was our first night in this neighbour and we didnt know where to eat. than we find this restaurant. a lot of people came here and the dinner was good; enough and tastes good good goooood. you can go here if you like greeks food. perfect.
great food and a good atmosphere. it looks nice and the people working here are fast and friendly. the food is high quality and tasty.
"this is a very nice restaurant with friendly staff, a great location and tasty food. the decor is exposed beams and welcoming and my friend and i had a really lovely evening. we were seated in a small booth which allowed some privacy but did not leave us out of the general atmosphere. the only issue we had is that they wouldnt accept a card and i had to go to the cash machine, but this may have been a temporary problem. it is worth asking when booking your table though..."

"we were driving on our bike to rooterdam en when we came back we were very hungry and went to this restaurant. there were not many man to eat, but it was cozy. the pizza which we ordered was perfect en more than enough. just go here and enjoy."
"a real pleasure. delicious simple italian food in a pleasant atmosphere. a top vitello tonnato and superb grilled lamb. decent quality chardonnay at an affordable price. light, airy, cosy decor. owner came to our table to see if all was ok. all-in-all good food at good value with attentive service."
"nice italian food. very generous portions. decor a bit old fashionned, maybe. cuisine is classical italian food, well prepared and served in generous portions. we especially liked the carpaccio, the lasagna and the basilicum cr√®me br√ªl√©e."
"had dinner here in july 2016. there is a nice, big terrace in front of the restaurant. we first had a drink at this terrace before we went inside. we had a nice table in the patio. the outside area on th backside of the restaurant is protected from rain and win "
"very nice experience. the place looks very cute, the food was very tasty, i highly recommend their vegetarian options."
two girlfriends and i enjoyed snacks and wine on the terrace overlooking the busy canal. service was speedy and with a smile and the snack was tasty. it is the perfect place to while away a few hours with friends on a summer evening.
"it is hard, if no impossible, to find genuine italian food abroad. and here you are...in the middle of nowhere, adjacent to a vacation resort, pops up this place that gets pretty close to the real thing. of course, they cater to a vast majority of dutch and german tourists and they have to keep that into account. but still: the pastas a pretty close to the original recipes, the pizzas are as close as youll get in holland and - believe it or not - even the espresso is a genuine, italian tasting espresso, as opposed to the muck one gets served too often in the netherlands. so bravo all over. biggest disappointment: kitchen closes extremely early."
fairly good italian food. the large round tables were well suited for group conversations during dinner. the food was served quickly after ordering. i could recommend the spaghetti corbonara and the saltimbocca with fries as a side dish.
"nice restaurant next to the complex office. friendly staff,and a good menu for all tastes. the lasagna was excellent. good choice of wines by the glass. friendly staff."
nice & quit place to have some ice cream and or coffee. very friendly staff with good service. i would recommend them and i would go back for some more ice cream.
"very good italian restaurant in the city center of drunen. the food is just amazing, so are the wines. service is super friendly and has lots of knowledge. and all this for very reasonable prices.  you can call this a hidden gem of drunen."
there used to be a different restaurant on this spot but since a while there is an italian restaurant at the corner of the central square in drunen and it is more plush than the name la cantina suggests. it has nice seats and tables for different sizes of parties and only when you are with 6 or more people it is necessary to make a reservation. in front of the restaurant there is also a big terrace outside overlooking the square with plenty of sunshine (because it is situated southward 
"nice place, central location.  the bigest amount of the clients are from older ages. nice ideas for lunch."
we were there for a quick lunch and yes this place was worth a visit > the food was good and we all liked it > the staff were friendly and the decor of the place was nice > a relaxed atmosphere> they also have a good outdoor sitting also but as it was cold that afternoon so we preferred to sit inside
we went to this place to have a lunch to celebrate my wifes birthday. when we arrived all tables outside with some shade were occupied so that we went in but after a couple left we still could sit outside. with a bit of wind the seating outside was pleasant and we were quickly served with some drinks and selected our lunch dish. because of the temperature we selected both a different salad and this was served about 15 minutes later. the plate did not look too big but after finishing it we found it well proportioned and also very tasty. we really enjoyed it and the place has a wide variety of dishes also for lunch at very reasonable prices. they are also one of the few places on the central square open on monday which is clever as their competitors are all closed. the location is very central close to parking places and in a very lively spot so that there is always something to look around.
relaxed atmosphere. good variety of food at reasonable prices. at busy times you can experience sometimes some longer waiting times when ordering your drinks or meals. friendly staff.
service was excellent food has improved since my last visit. staff is experienced and flexible! lot of things are possible if you want to adapt the menu! worth a visit!
when the weather is good its a great place to sit on the terrace.  good food. only sad thing is that the menu only changes 1 time a year.  if it offers more and frequent variations i would be dining here more often.
great italian food where you wouldnt expect it. nice views of the river in the summer and terrace. you may need to book though. the food was great and affordable.
"nice ambiance, good service, nice people, a bit crowded but thats normal if the food is good, good wine too btw."
"food is always amazing, great selection of really good wines and the service surpasses that of any dutch restaurant"

"we had guests over and im happy we picked this restaurant - service is excellent and food is delicious, the portion of food was so large that we were too full to have dessert in the end.  and the lake view is beautiful."
this place serves great food for a fair price. had the satay with french fries. coffee was also perfectly fine. great for groups.

"this was our 2nd visit, last year we had lunch in the building opposite, which wasnt that nice. we really like the new restaurant, its spacious, very cosy, love their industrial lights, and its very clean! the menu didnt change from our last visit; omelettes, baguettes, burgers, snacks and more traditional brasserie dishes, but no change in quality, very nice meal in good portions and at a very friendly price. the lady waiting on our table was really very friendly! my only tip would be to lose the stapled menu and get something more up to the image of the hotel, apart from that i wouldnt change thing, see you next year!!!"
we stopped just for a coffee.  the place was busy but we were made very welcome and staff were friendly and helpful.  lovely location in the town square beside the harbour.  coffee came quickly and was decent.  the apple cakes looked lovely... wish we had!
we were part of a large group that stopped for coffee. service was great.friendly multilingual staff made us feel very welcome.
my baguette of ham egg and cheese was fresh and delicious the coffee mellow and apple pie a great wedge of homemade goodness
"a recent fishing trip to holland saw me back in the hotel lely for, again, lemon sole and chips washed down with some wheat beer. the lemon sole was beautifully cooked. i had some ice cream to follow. another lovely meal in very pleasant but unpretentious surroundings. why cant we do this in the uk?"

"we came here as a coincidence while we were looking for another place and left very happy. we were a group of 4 and ordered the group menu of 3 course. all the porsions were more than enough and the food was very delicious. also their house wine was worth a try. waiters were attentive and friendly, and service timing was very good as well."
we had an evening party at the soete suikerbol organized by friends of ours. the location is suitable for this with a medium sized hall available. staff was very pleasant and service was great. sufficient parking available as well. music could not be very loud due to concerns for the neighborhood.
"delicious! kids declared this to be their favorite pancake house in nl. lovely, clean location. will definitely be back!"
"we went here for a wedding, which was very good organised. the ceremony took place in a small room at the back and then everyone could go to another room for drinks and nibbles. it is not too big, but suitable for small weddings/parties. my son cant eat gluten or milk, and as we had stated this on acceptance of the invitation, they had a separate cake and nibbles for him, which was very good."
the place is very nice. great decoration and very cosy and friendly atmosphere. lots of small and nice decoration ideas. good variety of dishes on the menu. very good variety of draft and bottled beer 
"the waiters are really nice and informal, typically nice dutch behavior, the food is good! there are many funny things to see there, especially on two walls! things for kids to play with, good idea! the atmosphere is relaxed, as a dutch person this is my favorite!"
first time visit to this nice brasser 
"this place is cozy, friendly and serves good quality, well thought out food. the menu is small, which i love because that means fresh and high level quality. certainly recommend dining here. it is a local favorite so i suggest reserving for a weekend evening - yes, even sunday nights they are quite full so call for certainty!

"ive been going to brasserie brocante once a week for 4 weeks now after my physio treatment in pijnacker. right from the start, i was very pleased with the food and the service. they have a cosy terrace out front that is enclosed with glass for the chillier days but can be opened up when warm weather arrives. for early in the day, i suggest their good value coffee and pastry deal; ive now tried their scones with jam and whipped cream as well as their large cream puff cut in half and filled with whipped cream and strawberries, both amazing."

"we enjoyed a very nice evening in this restaurant. both our menus were fantastic, with delicious dishes, accompanied by a nice selection of wines. staff was attentive and kind. i really enjoyed the local products menu with items sourced from the groene hart region. can definitely recommend this restaurant. they even have a hotel part, so you dont have to drive home (if you book a room, that is)."
this was our second stay and we were not disappointed. room as requested with the best view over the lake. food was sublime. staff helpful and friendly. all spoke the most excellent english. thank you - we will return!
"being on a bike trip for a week, we had no say as to where we stayed. but, this place was very special and not something we would have found on our own. our last two nights in the netherlands, the hotel was remote, quiet, located on a beautiful lake setting. the food was amazing, the staff accommodating, the room very spacious and well appointed. would recommend it to anyone!"
our family based in holland booked this hotel for us last minute as we had a family funeral to attend in the are 
"chef sjanie de geus is a phenomenon in the netherlands. great food, for a great price with equally fabulous view."
"we have just returned from the most fantastic weekend at de watergeus. we took a special arrangement les plus belles extra and booked a large room overlooking the lake. our room turned out to be a small apartment, with cooking facilities, a sitting room and separate bedroom. the whole was accompanied by a double balcony, festoned with colourful plants, overlooking the lake. all the rooms have mosquito netting, so there is adequate protection and our bed, certainly, was very comfortable. we had an electric boat ride with wine and delicious happy bites for the trip on,our first afternoon. on the second day we had a packed lunch and were given good bikes to discover the area. the restaurant itself provides the most delicious food and the wine list is comprehensive and not too expensive. we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
our food was very good. the wine list extensive. the view was beautiful overlooking the lake. we had pre drinks outside but it became too cold. the service and meal was delicious.
"made a reservation for my birthday and was contacted beforehand by the restaurant with questions about my allergy for nuts. very impressed! when we arrived, i ordered the 5-course surprise meal and my husband ordered 3 courses. waiter suggested to serve my husbands 3-courses in such a way that he would have something to eat for every course of my 5-course meal! the food was delicious, and the location of the restaurant is very nice indeed! well be back!"
"spacious, comfortabable restaurant with panoramic view of the lake. the michelin menu of ‚Ç¨ 36 excellent value for money wtih fresh, tasty produce and good combinations. perfect service."
"a special place at the borders of the lake. run by mother and daughter de geus, elegant with a great outerspace for spring and summer, good price quality relation with respect to diners and lunches. possible to harbour your boat and enjoy a late afternoon there."
"the location of this restaurant along the lakes of nieuwkoop is no less than magnificent. it is quite an experience to sip on a glass of cava while enjoying the sight of terns, grebes and even the rare purple her "
"we were attended to de watergeus by salmon-smokers rien and ingrid heemskerk. they supply watergeus with their products, and the menu indeed featured, as one of the dishes, three preparations of bawykov salmon. we had a 4-course dinner that offered a lot of variation. service was attentive, as you may expect of this class of restaurants. the restaurant has a great view over the tranquil nieuwkoopse plassen lake. we also stayed over for the night; the rooms were fairly simple in 70s style, but appropriate. after all, you come for the food. next day, the breakfast (which you pay extra) was very good, and allowed us to enjoy the view on lake again. an illustration of the hospitality that de watergeus offered was that my wife liked the small pillows that were provided in the bedrooms - on our depart, the staff happily provided us one for free."
"de watergeus is situated in a little village in the heart of holland. beautifully located on the border of the nieuwkoopse plassen (lake). from both the restaurant and the terrace, you have a direct view of the lake. in summertime you can also rent an electric boat to go on the lake (which we di "
"situated in natural region between small lakes. i had a nice room overlooking the garden, a very good tasting dinner - beautifull terras overlooking the lake - and had a good sleeping in the comfortable room. starting into the next day i enjoyed a marvelous dutch-breakfast. i enjoyed this hotel and ill return again!!!!!"
"we stayed at the watergeus for two nights while on a bike trip through the netherlands. the hotel is in a good location situated on a lake; the restaurant has a really scenic view right by the water. we ate two dinners and two breakfasts there. i would rate the food pretty-very good as there were many good courses. though the room we stayed in was just ok, i would recommend the hotel de watergeus for travelers to this part of the netherlands."
i have been 2 times to this restaurant and both times have been lovely experiences the 2nd time i took my mother and husband we took a boat ride in one of their whisper boats although a little chilly it added to our appetite and enjoyment of these lovely suroundings the food is tops the view wonderfu 
"we stayed here for two days and had a very small room (really small!) that overlooked the lake and it was really a beautiful view. summer probably has issues with mosquitoes, so you do have to be careful and always keep the screens closed. it was a truly lovely and peaceful place, with an excellent, caring staff. the little staircase to the rooms would be an issue for anyone with a balance issue or disability, but they helped to bring up the suitcas "
"we stayed 2 nights as part of a bike tour. our room did not face the lake, too bad, the wifi was spotty at best in our room, but the meals more than made up for the weaknesses here. the room we had was large, clean, in need of new carpet, comfortable. food is definitely the draw here."
"we stayed at this restaurant and hotel during our last two days with van gogh tours. i think there are nine rooms at this place which are comfortable and clean. our room overlooked the lakes but there are other rooms that overlook the garden. the staff was very gracious and attentive. breakfast and dinner were excellent (we had lunch elsewhere). breakfast was served at the table with yogurt, selections of bread, fruit, cereal, egg, coffee and teas. dinner was always delicious and beautifully plated. we also rented an electric boat from the hotel and enjoyed the water."

"we hear this used to be a cycle shop. now its a gourmet food stop of sorts with a nice restaurant in there. there is inside/outside seating, its got a very cool feel to it. we pretty much went burgers, fries and salads. its tasty. fun beer choices. its a little town and this is a great place to get fed. always looks busy in a good way. if i was passing thru id double date stach with lucianos ice cream. only gripe, parking is tough. "
stache foods are fantastic! variety that s different than regular restaurants tourists flock to. healthy foods
"we eat there often. the burgers, fries, and salad combo is among the best i have eaten. the owner researched the east coast of the u.s. to refine the recipe."
"i always go to stach in amsterdam. this place always has great takeaway lunch like the goats cheese salad, the warm meatball sandwich and freshly baked bread. very nice that overveen has stach too, yummie!"
we went for a coffee and some cakes during the afternoon. everything was delicious! we loved the cappuccinos. the place is very nice!
"the service is good and the food as well. slightly disappointed at the lack of salads on the menu - im a salad eater. there are a few though. there are nice items for take away if youre looking for a meal to take with you later. cappuccinos are delicious as are the chocolate bars they sell by the cash register. besides the salads, no complaints!"
"tipical hip restaurant and really nice interior. nice tap beers and fresh food (for take away as well), the only negative point is that the menu for dinner is short in warm dishes. i will be back!"

friendly staff and nicely located at the beach. we had some drinks and snacks in corona-time and it was well managed.
"we stumbled in from the cold into a place that made us forget the constant threat of stress. as we sat around a swell fire for a coffee and a hot chocolate we noticed the colourful surroundings in surprising and interesting architecture, the friendly staff and an international yet unpretentious menu made us decide us to stay for dinner. we unwinded and shifted into relaxmode and sat happily gazing at a glorious sunset. food was fine, so was the wine. had a great time."
this is one of the nicest restaurants we have been to.  the decoration and laid back ambience is great and the food is delicious.
the decoration is just really beautiful. if you are nearby it is definitely worth the visit. it is pet friendly and they even have a pet parrot . food is delicious and it came out really quickly. the owner martine is the best!
"i am responsible for a run of a smaller family business and this weekend has been unexpectedly full for us. now i see this huge restaurant running as it can, all people are smiling, the staff is super friendly,..i have to give them compliments for doing what they do in a weekend when the weather still shouldnt be how it is. thumbs upüëåüèº"
"all the other pavilions were gone, so we took our chance at the san blas. it was nice. the fire in the center, the view of the sea and the parrot walking around. lovel "
"love this place for a quick bite or a drink after walking through the kennemerduinen! they have a pretty extensive menu, the food is very good, and its a huge place so you can always find a seat. its also great in the winter, to watch the sea from a cosy indoor space."
"we went here on a saturday early morning. the perfect time to have a bit of this place and the beach for yourself, as it was soon getting crowded. we ordered some lunch and were relaxing at one of the many places where you can hang out in this place. the service is great, and the decoration very lovely. it only took a little while every time we ordered something before we got it."
we booked this restaurant as we were staying nearby. there were fifteen of us and we had a private room. after a shaky start we were allocated our own waitress. after that it was fantastic. everyone loved their food - we had a mix of snacks and mains and they were all great. the ambience was nice and the staff friendly. i recommend it. 
"love the healthy and yammie food, not the typical beach club meals. the costa rica interior makes me always feel very positive and happy, espacially during the winte "
"just a brief stop for a coffee. the whole vibe is very laid back so don‚Äôt visit if you are in a rush. otherwise sit back, enjoy the view and wait for your coffee. it is worth it"
"this restaurant is more catered for for lunch and snacks then diner. they only have a 3 choice maincourse menu but an extensive salad menu. the food is well prepared and slads are large the staff is ok, not overtly friendly, but all in all its an ok place"
"lovely surroundings, very friendly staff and great coffee. there was a wide choice of seats and blankets for sitting outside. it was just a shame we didnt have more time to spend as i could have easily spent the day chilling out."
"early march, the sun is out and temperature is friendly until laten in the afternoon. san blas is a great place on the dutch beach not far from zandvoort which attracts many visitors for both drinks and dinner. we visited with our family of 15 members and they gave us a fantastic room with a spectacular view on the sea sinking in the sea. the food is just right for this location with a choice of salads, fish and meat"
"we had cycled through the dunes the long way, stopped in at parnassia aan zee for a drink and then arrived at bloemendaal aan zee for lunch. great menu, excellent outdoor area on a hot sunny day, with very friendly and speedy service. i ordered falafels with an interesting salad mix on a large pita. excellent value for money. hubby had a croquet, which was ok. kids enjoyed their spring rolls and nachos. lots of vegetarian options. very glad we found this place to refresh after riding 20 kms. would definitely come back. "
"stopped in for lunch before hitting the beach when we arrived in bloemendaal aan zee. nice vibe with good music. service was a bit slow, but the food was really good. we really enjoyed the salads (both the goat cheese and the salmon & shrimp), and younger daughter liked the chicken satay, although the sides with that were curried, which she didnt care for. "
"we had cycled from zandvoort to haarlem through the national park. we decided to take a detour on the way back and go and have a look at bloemendaal. there wasnt much there - a hotel, seaview apartments, a couple of bars and a fantastic beach... with bars and restaurants... including them is san blas. what a gem of a place. we had a couple of drinks sheltered from the wind by the perspex breaks but we were well looked after. not expensive and could have sat there all day. a short (4k) cycle back to zandvoort alongside the beach and we were well satisfied with our day out."
san blas is the only restaurant on the bloemendaal beach what is open the whole ye 
"when looking at de koornmolen, a restaurant is not to be expected to be too fancy. however, in this case there is an exception. a fair menu, with not too many choices, but a nice variety, offers me some good choices. drinks are available in all ranges. location is nicely styled. the service is doing well, friendly and sharp. food tasted good. vegetables are to be found on your plate and it shows that the cook knows his job. prices are fair. went here two times in a week. well done."
"what a beautiful relaxing place to stay and eat ! we arrived casually , but it was definitely a perfect decision to sta "
"the menu is not very extensive, but the food is good. the staff is very friendly and always trying to do their best. would recommend this restaurant."
"visiting this restaurant once every month and can recommend it to anyone. the restaurant offers a limited number of dishes, which makes it easy to decide what you want to eat. the meals are all very nice, staff extremely friendly and they serve excellent wines. together with a the option to enjoy your dinner inside or outside on the terras and a perfect price-quality balance, makes this a perfect choice for your romantic or family dinners."
what a dream! this is the most italian part of italy in the netherlands. it is hidden quite well so you must really know where you‚Äôre going but it is absolutely worth the effort. we had spaghetti with shrimps and a pizza. i was blown away by the refined taste. we sat outside in the lovely garden where fresh herbs and spices are grown. the garden is a 1000 square meter representation of heaven. should you be in neighbouring zoetermeer or gouda - make sure you‚Äôll venture out to buon gusto in moerkapelle. trust me : it will be a night to remember!
"this medium-sized restaurant is a hidden gem in moerkapelle. looking for some ice-cream on a sunny afternoon, we stumbled upon an ice-cream cart with a tastefully decorated outside area and restaurant behind it. olive and oak trees were growing, with nice tables and parasols in between. at the back is a small wooden cubbyhouse for the children and an elaborate herb and flower garden where you can walk through. the staff are friendly and happy to make a chat. the ice-cream was nice and cheap, although you do get quite a small portion and there are only 4 choices, but the children were happy with it. we had a cappuchino and a coffee latte, both tasteful. in the end, it turned out to be a great place to have a break and relaxed time with the kids. for a moment it feels like you step out of holland and straight into romantic italy :-)"
de tintel tuin is a very pretty well kept garden with heaps of flowers in all different beds. there is also beautiful art in the garden. this art is for sale. they have a half open shed where you can have a cup of coffee as well as a decent lunch. they also have a nice terrace a bit away from the sh 
this is a great place to have breakfast or lunch genuine food local produce and even more friendly and personal service lovely nature walks and breakfast in nature you must go there
we went here for a family dinner and it was delicious! service and atmosphere were great too. prices a little expensive but it was worth every penny.
my family and i went here today and were pleasantly surprised by being served by a wonderfully cheerful lady who spoke to us in english in an english accent (it seems her mother is english 
i dont eat grain or sugar. the staff did their best to make a great dinner for me. they were helpful and made me a great dish. during our time in eersel we ate twice there because of this. recommend them
using this restaurant for lunch sandwiches. excellent selection and variety of rolls and sandwiches or french baguettes. always fresh ingredients and prepared while you wait. one sandwich is a full meal on its own!
"friendly helpful staff who take time to help explain the menu., good food selection is just right for ether late breakfast or light lunch. very good value all dishes are well thought out . menu in both dutch and english. we went for lunch as a family two adults and two teenagers. but this is not a place just for families, lots of locals of all ages. chairs and tables outside as well as inside."
visited with daughter on a weekday. we had lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality. the service was first class and the outdoor seating area was nice and clean and facing a small square. recommended.
nice place for a good meal for an cheep prise. friendly staff who try to make for jou a nice evening
"don‚Äôt expect haute cuisine, the menu is not very surprising. nevertheless, the food is delicious and well prepared for a good price."
"for lunch or dinner, their salads are great. ive tried them all and every time i loved it! and the staff is very friendly. 5 stars :)"
"these guys are the friendliest in town, and nothing is too much trouble for them. a lovely little local place, good for pub food and a nice drink with friends. a little old fashioned on the interior but it‚Äôs eersel not eindhoven!"
"driving to germany to see my daughter, but wanted to have a stop off for spot of lunch....after studying map looked at eersol in holland...looks like a nice town and just of main route....pulled off junction and easy to find town, but if your stopping with a car then you will need a disc to display time as you are allowed 2 hours to park as most locals use there bikes, we where lucky a local gave us there disc as they had 2.....very nice people in eersol, after we parked we walked about, not many shops to explore but a lovely town, so pretty and a friendly town, we came across this resaurant after checking out the others but i liked the look of the food people was having....they had a menu in english which made it easy and staff polite, you can sit inside but was a sunny and warm day when we visited so sat outside alongside the road, not busy with cars but alot of cycles, i had a seafood salad and wow i loved every part of it, the whole family enjoyed eating here, check out my photo....the prices wasnt too bad as the quality of food was very good and staff always on hand to clear tables of serve drinks, very clean inside and out.......car parking not too far away which free........i would highly recommend stopping off in this town and having a spot of lunch just wonder if the other restaurants are as good as this....just across the road pop over for some ice cream....next time i drive to germany i will came back here for lunch.......happy eating.."
went there for a quick lunch for work. their card gives a good variety of lunch options. they serve both hot and cold lunch dishes. good value for your money.
"we have eaten here four times now during two separate trips to the netherlands. we have not been disappointed on any occasion. theres a good selection on the menu to choose from and if your dietary requirements are a little complicated then the young, cheerful staff will ensure youre accommodated wherever possible. the portions are large so theres no fear of leaving hungry! there are many places to eat in eersel but this restaurant made life easy by having menus written in english! our dutch runs only to saying good morning and thank you, for which we should be ashamed. we have recommended this restaurant to others and we will return again on our next trip to the area."
in dinee-cafe veertien they give good quality and good service. enough choice for different meals and drinks.
weve visited this restaurant with relatives. we had a nice evening out. the food was pretty good as was the service. we made a reservation as it was sunday and then the restaurant is always packed. weve been here before last year. the restaurant keeps up the quality and good service! defenitely would recommend this restaurant.
"visiting this place with some relatives. it is one of the many restaurant and caf√©s you can find around eersels markt and they are offering a nice, small selection of food. the place has this special dutch cosines and inside it is rather big. while we were visiting it was not so crowded, so noise levels were perfect to have a conversation. the staff is very young and attentive, drinks and food were served in time. the food is very nice and was tasting well. maybe the portions are a bit big, we had more than enough to eat. it was a nice evening out. prices were average, for dutch standar "
this place was recommended by our air bnb host and it didn‚Äôt disappoint!   we ended up having 3 courses as the food was so good.  the staff were friendly and happy to translate the menu for us.  would definitely recommend.
it was a surprise to be called back on our reservation. since we had asked for a quiet spot because of our fahter who is a little deaf and old 
"been here a few times, food and staff are good, drinks are nice, service is great..we will be back again.."
"we ate at tok tok on the recommendation of our bed and breakfast landlady. the staff received us warmly and offered to translate the menu into english. the food was delicious and good value for money, plenty of choice. we didnt manage a dessert but they looked very enticing. "
"one of the best places i found in netherland, spare ribs are exellent, the deserts delicious and very kind service"
"a great restaurant with an extensive menu. great staff, excellent service and delicious food. highly recommended for a fun night out."
"i liked the atmosphere, rustic and cozy, with nice background music and a the lady who came to greet us very friedky before sho took our orders."
we had great diner with my businesspartner. thank you chef micha for the delicious food. good place to eat for a couples and bussines people. hvala / thank you
super restaurant near the b&b i was staying in landsmeer. friendly fun waitstaff and great reasonable food in a nice atmosphere.
highly recommend this place to people that want to spend a lovely evening together. the service is very nice and the pace in which they serve the food gives you the ability to enjoy each others company without feeling rushed.
"great food and service!!  we looked at the menu but the waiter recommended we go for the special.  this was awesome advise and it was a delicious multi course meal with smoked salmon, beef tartar and some other great food"
"beautiful surroundings and view, outside seating is wonderful. next to bicycle and hiking trails & routes. mostly self service"
"what a delightful find the perfect lunch stop on my way through. being an orangery it is light and airy tastefully furnished with a stunning view of the gardens  the food, coffee and welcoming staff are all good."
"during the summer months - in the winter the orangerie is used for its original purpose: housing of the plants - the orangerie is a beautiful location for a lunch. fantastic terrace view. self service. high quality food, many fresh ingredients. most choices are so eur 6 - eur 8. so price worth. located in the rosendael castle parc."
"just had the club sandwich, dutch style and it was really great!  the staff are really friendly.  great location"
"after walking around in this small village we stopped at this restaurant for a warm chocolate and what snack. good service, quick and friendly staff. the fries made from the local beemsterpotatoes and it was good."
"friendly people and atmosphere. made reservation by phone few days ahead. had a enthousiastic conversation. at our arrival few days after, the owner herself received us with referral to our conversation. very personal touch, we definitly will return asap!"
i love coming here for dinner. the fantastic atmosphere makes it a pleasure to come here. they serve great pancakes but also great meat and fish dishes. everything i prepared with quality products and i can definitely advise anyone around in the area to pay them a visit.
great dinner very good nice place for dinner. also for lunch very good. it is a very good restaurant so we regular guests.
"max and liesbeth work with local, seasonal products in their open plan kitchen. food is wonderful, the staff that serves are a delight (son and daughter). an excellent, local restaurant, well worth the visit if you are in de neighbourhood. local beer (beemster) on tap. on wednesdays they have specials on too, very affordable, but call ahead..."
"very nice building, easy parking. simple interior, dominated by a bar, room will hold 30 to 45 persons. pleasant staff. short menu, maybe stronger at lunch than dinner items, but sufficient choice to accommodate different tastes. superb salads, with a touch of creativity (grilled pineapple!) and a well chosen balance of tastes. chef gives clear preference to locally produced products. spanish coffee brand pleased all of us and the homemade walnut pie that came with it was fantastic: restrained in sweetness and super-fresh. nicely priced."
"we had a lot of time to kill in the amsterdam airport. we saw some tables and chairs next to the caf√© comunal. the area was completely full. we saw a lady getting ready to leave, and we asked if we could have her table and she said, ‚Äúof course.‚Äù we went to the counter and ordered a coke zero and a bottle of water. it was just what we needed. we did think the price of ‚Ç¨ 8+ was on the high sid "
this a small and nice convenience store with a variety of beverages - hot and cold.  the prices are reasonable.  good place to get grab and go stuff quickly.
"very busy. quick service. food quality - the pits! mcdonalds is better quality, according to my husband! i asked for glass of water and was referred to drinks cabinet. i confirmed that i wished ‚Äòglass of water‚Äô - referred to the bar. i had the buzzer with me and asked again for 2 glasses of tap water; once again, i was referred to bottled water cabinet - i asked if it was free and she confirmed it was not. i said i want tap water, she asked if i had paid for the meal - taking note that i had buzzer in my hand! i kept cool, said yes, and she gave me the tap water. someone a bit less forthright might have paid!!! avoid this place like the plague! got fish n chips - it was like fish bites that had been battered umpteen times. not a lot of places to eat as it was a sunday evening"
"flying out through amsterdams schiphol airport, stopped of at hmshost for a morning cafe latte. nice caf√© latte in schiphol airport, though very much over-priced as youd expect in an international airport. no gluten free food options. service was ok."
"good food, healthy, fresh and fast.  not overly priced considering the venue. nothing else to add. nothing selse, nothing else, nothing else."
"great meal on a stopover, so nice service. jan, our bartender, has a great conversation! feels like we are at our local bar! at the airport, unbelievable!"
"had a salmon and avocado on toast and it was obviously made with care and pride, despite it being towards the end of the shift.  nasek, thanks, will be back."
"perfect for a quick breakfast and the coffee was delicious! the prices were reasonable. our server was attentive and friendly. this place is spacious and has plenty of seating. overall, very good for a quick bite!"
"as famished travellers on our journey home, it was a pleasant surpise to be able to find a good old english breafast serv "
"as far as quick food places go in airports, hms host is a bit better than the average. they offer a lot of choices for varying diets as well as serving beer for breakfast. i opted for coffee this time around. i choose the three egg omelet for 8.95 euro. it came with eggs cooked perfectly, two hash browns, three sausages, two strips of bacon and a side of beans. everything was very good. where i would criticize them is in the size of the beans. it came in a cup the size they use to give you pills in a hospital. i would be surprised if it amounted to a tablespoon. i wanted to be like oliver and go back up to the counter and simply state, please, sir, i want some more. otherwise, i really enjoyed my meal."
"i had scrambled eggs and panini, and both were quite good. i was surprised at how good they were for a fast-food place in an airport. staff were friendly."
we got sandwiches and coffee here.  we also got a sausage roll. really enjoyed the sandwiches.  the dutch cheese one was unreal good. coffee was good too. amsterdam bread company really has good bread.
for an airport food restaurant this was a high quality establishmen 
"we decided that we would eat at the airport before we boarded our flight and chose this place, which was actually surprisingly good for an airport. we had a couple of toasties, a dutch and a goat‚Äôs cheese one, and a glass of wine ea "
the hms host bar at schiphol has a very friendly bartender. when we were there so was darius rucker. he was left at peace. very professional
"we had burgers and club sandwich here, all very tasty. fresh juice was also good. the prices? high but this is an airport restaurant."
"sometimes its challenging to find decent food at the airports, i like the variety in this restaurant. las time i had a miso soup with udon noodles and shrimp, and that was actually really tasty! it was a little on the expensive side though - 14.70eur."
had hot drinks and a slice of pizza. it was all very good but airport prices. pizza portions are reheated when you order.
"i was here before the departure and bought excelent chocolate piece. they have white, milk and dark chocolate that is cutted to the same pieces. you can give a gift bag and put  the chocolate pieces in it. highly recommended dark chocolate."
"airport food is never great but the harvest market in the d gates has a good selection of basic hot and cold foods. pizza, wraps, pies, smoothies, beer. if you fancy mixing things up this place offers quite a few options. can get busy, but there is plenty of seating. "
early(earl) and i7 eelco are the best hosts ever :)) they feel you welcomed . i had a great time. thanks again  mia
i had a dutch burger with some chips. thoroughly enjoyed it. the price wasnt bad as well. thank you maurice
"my husband needed to get a quick bite prior to continuing our journey to the rhine river cruise. he ordered the sausage roll at 3.55 and coke 3.35 which was a fair price for an airport. it was very good, hot and fresh. in fact on our way back to the states, he stopped by and got another sausage roll. a good quick stop on the run."
everything in the airport is fast moving and busy. this restaurant adapts to the crowds by opening more tills. easy to use but a bit of a struggle getting round with your stuff and carrying a tray. very helpful staff and nice juice and coffee. this is my regular at this airport.
called in for breakfast good service. ordered coffee this was also good had breakfast this was a lot of food but cooked and tasted very good
"if you are in a hurry at schipol airport and waiting to catch a flight, this is just the place if you want to have  bite. nice variety especially the sandwitches."
"i eat here during my layover and found that at least their yakitori was good. actually suprisingly good for airport food. it wasnt super cheap, but not expensive either. also it was really quiet place to wait for my plane."
"to our surprise, the beef b√ºrger with frites was more than excellent. the price was okay. very friendly people."
"located in the main concourse at the schipol airport, this is a great place to pick up a fresh dutch lunch and sandwich after your flight. i was staying at the sheraton airport hotel and found it convenient to walk back into the airport to enjoy lunch at this location. "
"for a grab-and-fly experience, that was just ok. however, i did not tempt fate as to order more advanced food sold as simili-asian, as trust did not build in my brain. in any case, i would not dare to try their kind of exotic dutch sus "
"when walking around looking for asian food for breakfast, we saw this restaurant has very good looking sashimi and sushi, so we decided to walk in and give it a tri "
hms host is decent place to enjoy nice coffee and meal on the go while waiting for your flight at schiphol airport.
"easy to transport on plane, definitely a step above airline food, very fast and friendly service.  worth a stop!"
had good green curry with great service by sunate! she was very helpful . easy to order by tablet ...
"freshly prepared food was very tasty including the salads. tuna mayo rolls were filled to overflowing. just a pity they had no white wine, had to make do with red. staff very friendly and efficient."
they made an excellent breakfast of 2 eggs and bacon.  the hamburger was excellent too.  was very happy with the food from a place at the airport.
"first visit to schipol and panorama terrace, terrible windy day and son airspotting taking photos, so popped in for tea (we irish love our tea!) ok..so this big glass of piping hot water arrives! no handle,.no cup,.very hot! and expensive 3.60euro, ok its airport prices, and more of a cultural misunderstanding perhaps??.. of how tea should be served? but the taste was quite refreshing and quite nice taste, but do watch you dont burn your hands or drop the glass! staff were wondering what my issue was when nicely trying to explain it should be served in a cup. then had to ask for milk. the staff are friendly. had nice coffee here later,.and good selection of food on offer. nice and clean as well."
"the food was a little overpriced and the staff need training in basic things like how to smile and treat customers with care - its a shame because we might forget what we had to eat, but we will never forget any bad service or lack of it "
"stopped for a quick bite at the b terminal in the small hms kiosk. the kiosk (despite it being 0800) was picked over and they were sold out of a lot. of the last three sandwich varities, they had a smoked salmon sandwich. though the gentlemen at the kiosk hadnt tried the salmon sandwich, i purchased it (5,45 euros). i peeled it open and oh my gosh it was delicious! i checked the package to see what else was inside my smoked salmon sandiwch and it had a layer of egg salad and capers. if you are at the stand in terminal b, grab a smoked salmon sandwich!"
"i was in latvia for work last month. the airport is not that big and i had no trouble getting through it when i first arrived or when i was leaving. i did not that there where not too many places to eat or drink. there are some, just not a lot. the staff was friendly and the airport its self was clean."
"kebaya offers asian food, although the name kebaya suggests indonesian (the kebaya refers to the indonesian dress women wear) its more japanese/chinese style. food is ordered via the ipad which works surprisingly efficient, maybe a little impersonal. anyway, on both occasions that ive visited kebaya i enjoyed good and fresh sushi/sashimi. it really beats the regular burger or sandwich usually served at airports."
"kebaya is one of the hms host restaurants in schipol airport, this one is an oriental restaurant and i visited twice in the space of a couple of weeks (outward and return journey). both times i had the shoyu ramen which was very tasty and a good sized porti "
good baguette sandwiches for under 7 euros and other choices that tend to be healthy. plenty of seating with area kept in good order. above average for budget eating in an airport.
"while at the airport, we had lunch at hms.  the prices were reasonable.  the salmon on baguette sandwich was delicious.  the coffee was very good too."
perfect service - very helpful and working fast. the espresso tastet perfect and so did the sandwich too. flaguette chs/ham!
"this place proclaims it is promoting pure flavor and setting the path for the future of fast food. foods are reasonably price. we ordered a falafel (roasted sweet potato) rice box and two charbroiled chicken and pork rice box. great taste, delicious. the lemonade drink was refreshing, a great thirst quencher. fast service, friendly staff. "
"nice environment and good sushi. the price/quality ratio is not exciting, but being inside the airport acceptable. very good service and nice waiters"
had a hour to kill and had not eaten breakfast. had a tuna melt panini which was quite good along with a cappuccino which was great. e6 for the sandwich and e4 for each coffee so typical airport prices but at least the food was good
"quick and easy coffee bar waiting for your airplane to arrive. coffee and a fruit juice for under a tenner, brilliant.."
"if you are worried about being safe, i guess anything could happen but they certainly take a lot of precautions; there were at least 7 checks.  compelling architecture and artwork throughout the airport.  lot of places go eat and great shopping."
the place is nice and modern; clean and have excellent pastries and coffee! they also have fresh sandwiches and fruits. i had the greatest cappuccino ever!  good service also!
"schiphol is a great airport in many ways. the 4 hours free wifi, comfy halls to rest from flight to flight, very friendly crew, fast and efficient passport control, safe, clean, beautiful and so many shops to take a look and good spots to eat. sadly, i found that now theres a mc. donalds in one restaurant area, but well, nobody is perfect. "
we ate here before catching our flight home. the fish and chips was under 7 euros and freshly cooked. they do splendid cakes and the wine was cheap by airport standards.
"if you have time before going through to departures then this is a great place to stop. good range of food and cooked well, the chicken satay is really good. best place to eat if you dont want a sandwich in the airport."
nice food and service for a reasonable price.  plenty of seating including an area you can charge your phone/computer and/or work while you eat.
"cant stop talking about the kibbeling & fries for 8.50 euros.  perfect fish and chips, just what the heart wants before boarding another flight.  nice staff, clean kitchen and service area. hey, its dutch."
had eaten a lot during the day and didnt feel like much other than a dinner snack. decided to try this place and were pleasantly surprised. we had one ham on a rather delicious roll and one with 2 generous slices of cheese for a mere euros 9.40 .. inside the airport. plenty of room to sit or you can take it out. ask how to find this place at the info booth if you cant see it right away (its inside).
hms is on the lower floor and is easy to find. nothing spectacular on offer but the good plain food is reasonably priced. seating is fine and the wifi is free.
spent a very happy hour here en route back to the uk. what a haven before your flig 
"we tried chicken pizza, sandwich and soft t "
"i was looking for some breakfast, and got quick service!  my egg and ham sandwich was tasty and filling.  the service was very friendly and in english, although im sure they speak dutch as well as other languages."
"this cafe coco was our best experience at amsterdam airport while having a long layover there. good service and absolutely artistically made salads and sandwiches! they were a piece of real culinary arts. and very delicious! if i remember the name of a guy who made them, it was daniel. i wish i know more places like that around my house in la. if one day im back there, cafe coco would be my first place to go."
"we arrived en spec for a late evening flight and quickly found a free table  the service is slow and the menu limited , but given the few restaurants to choose from we were pleased to have stopped here  the food was delicious"
a really lovely positive team that can‚Äôt do enough for you. the food is delicious and prepared with love and flare.   you may wait a minute longer‚Ä¶but good things come to those who wait.  i‚Äôll be back.
"given the wait line and occupancy of the restaurant, we expected good food was the emphasis. we were not disappointed with my wife ordering the hot goat cheese salad and me ordering the salmon sandwich with tempura crips. the sandwich was the best i have had with precise layers salmon, cream cheese, and crust-removed bread drizzled with a light mustard sauce in a presentation that made eating with the eyes before devouring with gi track. just excellent savory."
"i never mind a long layover in amsterdam. the airport is lovely and clean and made even better by cafe coco. i abhor being served coffee in paper cups; cafe coco uses beautiful cups and saucers. they‚Äôre pastries not only look enticing, they‚Äôre actually delicious. the high-backed chairs are lovely as well. treat yourself during your next layover and check this place out!"
"good for all day breakfast, excellent selection with additional bubbles if that‚Äôs y fancy. service not the quickest  but it‚Äôs much quieter than most places in airport,"

"i never write reviews, but this is truly the exception to my rule. we had a couple of hours before our flight departed out of amsterdam and were looking for somewhere to eat. cafe coco, looked cute and the menu looked very appealing for ‚Äúairport‚Äù food. so, we tried to find a seat. it was very busy, and we were warned that it may take a while to get our order. however, with time on our hands we decided to stay. we found a seat at the counter and we were able to watch the food being prepared by a very talented chef. what an experience!!!! dilman was a true pleasure to watch. he is truly an artist with his preparations and the food was truly amazing!!! i wish i could have tried everything that we saw him prepare. he is an absolute pleasure to talk to and even though he was incredibly busy, he found a few moments here and there to converse with us and based on our conversations provided some pairings that were better than many top tier restaurants we have visited world wide. the staff were very pleasant and so polite even though they were completely snowed under. dilman, thank you for making our final moments in amsterdam so pleasant and memorable. we will definitely be back and hope to experience your hospitality again. blessings to you and all the staff at cafe coco."
weve been dining here for years now during our travels. the food is very beautiful in presentation and superbly executed. what creates a problem at this restaurant is the naming of it as a cafe. the limited staff and number of seats poses a challenge for those looking for a fine (airport) dining experience (and willing to pay for the privilege) because most travelers decide to come here for just a cup of coffee or hot chocolate and spend a lot of their time waiting for their flight. of course this is an important option in any airport but when other guests would like to spend their time and money on a wonderful full course meal (breakfast or lunch) it becomes an unpleasant destination. perhaps it would be a better choice to maintain a section as an actual restaurant for dining (and not just one person in a group of 4-6 ordering a croissant...thats not dining) and another section as a specific cafe destination for those who want to save their money and remain sipping their one coffee and surfing the web for the duration of their wait time for their transit.
"visited here on one of our transfers through schiphol, service from all staff was very good, as always service with a smile, keep it up, we will call in on our next visit to schiphol airport."
"this was a fantastic breakfast to kick off our trip. the baked eggs were excellent. even better was a seat at the bar to watch them being made, over and over again. i would definitely recommend this for a coffee and breakfast ( not to mention the bonus chocolate!)"
this would be a treat for breakfast anywhere even at a 5 star hotel. thank you for a pleasant moment on a long travel day.
.... which says it all really. more comfortable and less rushed than the other cafes - a little oasis of peace and style. try the truffle and parmesan oeufs - truly delicious!
having coffee here after long haul flight. good coffee and deserts in the middle of busy airport. feel refreshed!
"during connections, at international airports, is very frequent on get too much time waiti "
"a chocolate and champagne bar that‚Äôs a cut above most of what is on offer in schiphol. an all day breakfast of eggs salmon and spinach was good value at ‚Ç¨12.  service was good, tea came with a fancy chocolate."
"pricey like any good airport food, but the salmon and rice was amazing.  photo does not do it justice. clean and open atmosphere with private seating if that‚Äôs preferred."
so glad we didn‚Äôt go for a coffee in starbucks. table service in an airport is rare but the staff here were wonderful. excellent coffee - we had two and a trio of sandwiches served with edible flowers and a honey dressing.
"lovely coffee and desserts.     excellent surroundings and service, and it was actually cheaper than some of the chain junk outlets.  i will definitely be back.    excellent ."
"a good lunch - cesar salad with a fine chocolate mouse and a caf√© cr√®me, in a wonderful and comfortable place at schipol airport! one si bemol - the staff a little more careful! but this may be because there was a lot of people for lunch."
"ok its not particularly cheap, but i must say that i enjoyed the food and the environment. also the location is good for flights from d gates. maybe it was a quiet afternoon at schiphol (?) but caf√© coco made a nice change from the normal hustle and bustle"
absolutely love it! warm environment! great customer service! unique presentation! amazing flavors! i always want to come back!
thought should have breakfast before my connection and this place delivered. food is delicious and quick. wait staff were helpful and friendly. price is ok as well. you should try it.
"fabulous coffee and nice chocolate on the side is ,for us, the number 1  at the airport. always a worthwhile stopping off spot.and one place  we look forward to during our regular stop over at the airport. pricy admittingly but do go here ."
i always stop here for a meal before boarding to return to the  
schiphol airport can be a maddening place. it‚Äôs huge and connecting from an overnight us flight makes for a very rough morning in schiphol. peace and quiet in a bust place like schiphol is a blessing ‚Äì and here it i 
"i had a couple of hours in schiphol so i was able to stop and grab some great hot chocolate here as well as great chocolate to take home for friends and family. i also picked up a little for myself. it is beyond amazing and while it is a little on the pricey side, it is totally worth it!!!!! the staff is very friendly."
i rarely review airport restaurants...but cafe coco is an exception. while i would not venture here for the food alone and i am not even sure if you could...if you happen to be in the airport it is a lovely spot. the service is excellent the food very good...with an eye for excellence and beauty. while i have certainly had better breakfasts...there are few i have enjoyed in as much in an airport.
"caf√© coco is our favorite place for respite after the frantic check-in process at schiphol. we always have a cup of their brilliant hot chocolate to accompany some other menu item. most recently we had their oeuf en cocotte with ham. delicious! also, their chinaware is beautiful."
"cafe coco is half chocolate store, half exclusive champagne bar and patisserie. very good coffee and a small selection of great cakes.  set out of the way so can be a bit quieter.  not cheap by quality is good."
"friendly service, good wiev, delicious good, nice seats. what can you wait more while spending your time at the airpo "
"not only does this place have the only real coffee behind customs, the coffee is of good quality and staff know how to operate their machi "
having tried a different cafe who had ran out of tea (!) and all but 2 types of cake we came across cafe coco and the experience couldn‚Äôt have been differe 
"after ten hours in airports, canceled flights and a terrible night, i passed by the starbucks and went into the beckoning cafe cocoa (a young man promised the best coffee in amsterdam), to the right of the escalator in the klm huge mall to the terminal on my international flight. it was restorative. like a different world. the expresso, divine, the cocoa served in fine pink and gold china, the salmon and croissant, both the freshest ive had in ten years! very attentive waitress. a free praline chocolate and a book on vermeer and rembrandt to peruse on a marble table helped me regain my equilibrium. as a single senior woman traveling, thanks, cafe cocoa!"
"this is an upmarket cafe located in the departure area at schiphol airport. it has a pleasant seating area with views of the aircraft. there is tableservice and all the staff are very polite and professional. the wine list is very good. also on the menu are teas, coffee and everything from a light snack to a full mea "
"slow inattentive service.  no toilets anywhere near. problematic.  crunchy salmon with risotto was excellent.  salad so so  priced like upscale restaurant, ambience was more like a side walk cafe  b-"
due to a flight delay i found myself with 4 hours to wait in schipol airport. i needed to eat something good and this was just the ticket. tucked behind lounge 2 cafe coco is a hidden gem. good views across the gate d apron and spacious seating. i had the crispy salmon and risotto which was delicious. then coffee and chocolate. a highly recommended way to waste time in an airport.
a nice and fancy location on airport schiphol. friendly and helpfull staff. good drinks and great chocolats.
perfect service and very nice people. fast services. have a good connection with gate departure. thanks .
"we went to caf√© coco for diner. the restaurant is in a quiet corner of schiphol airport and is quite spaciously set. we had a very kind and efficient waitress which was very pleasant. i had the salmon steak with crust while my husband took the steak. both were incredibly delicious!! still salivating when i think of the food. what a way to start your holiday!! a small warning: prices are quite high, but the quality of the food is up there."
"it looked like a champagne and chocolate bar, but we could order cupachino and hot chocolate. delighted it was served in vilroy and bosch china. the seating and view was great."
"nice food, desserts and service . steak and solmon has small portions for a man but taste was good . coffee and chocolates are good too. nice to sit in retro design chairs ."
friendly staff who help you as soon as you sit. love their interior styl 
some friends of of ours always eat here when in holland so brought us for lunch. i‚Äôm sure most won‚Äôt look past the ‚Ç¨33 set lunch but break it down and i‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd spend nearly as much upstairs at starbucks drinking awful coffee and eating nasty pre packed sandwiche 
we ended up in here almost by default as the catering facilities at the airport are limite 
a lovely spot to relax while waiting for your flight. we were made very welcome. a good selection of snacks and drinks are on offer in elegant surroundings.
this was our 2nd stop at cafe coco in schipol. espresso drinks are served steaming hot and flavorful in real porcelain cups with a wonderfully tasty praline on the side--exactly what is needed sometimes when youre traveling to gain a sense of cal 
my friends and i enjoyed a champagne toast with chocolate and croissants. we had a long layover and this quiet corner was a perfect place for us to relax before our flights home. food was excellent as was the service! lovely and sunny and bright! i will stop in again!
sophisticated quiet corner of the airport. excellent coffee and spectacular chocolate deserts. very pleasant with attentive service.
"found a new place to frequent at schiphol. if you are looking for something with a little more quality with your airport experience and have an hour plus to spare try this place. very small selection, 4 mains reasonably sized and what appears to be a modern high tea available amongst other things like starters and desserts. i had the ravioli, nice and fresh, served in a very pretty dish with gold detail. service is a bit too relaxed for a place that knows everyone has somewhere to be but all in all a nice experience! "
"a great little find is cafe coco a great place to unwind before a flight in a 5 star environment. beautifully created chocolate, afternoon teas and desserts to savour. i had english breakfast tea served with decorated china tea cups and with real tea leaves. i succumbed to a light creamy and mango dessert that was heavenly. highly recommend "
loved the dishes all served on china and crystal! loved the quiet area tucked beside windows away from bustling lines of people rushing to their respective destinations. loved the great service & the great food!! it was definitely worth paying a little more for this relaxing esperience! 
"after an awful experience at a different schipol cafe this place was a nice find. the service was very slow, the queue for coffee was long and the prices were expensive however this cafe has a nice and cosy seating area to relax in, and the coffee was actually not too bad."
"very nice place , good location in the information airport in amsterdam city  the attention is faster and the worker are friendly  good option for q coffee or sandwich in your connection here"
"i think you can get away with sitting in the cafes comfortable perimeter chairs without ordering. but i went mad and spent 12.70 euros on mango iced tea (lots of fruit and mint) and a coffee (little praline thrown in). food and cakes all looked excellent, but prices to mat "
what a peaceful oasis in the rolling sea that is schiphol. comfy chairs in a quiet area. i had a delicious seafood platter with a delicious fruit iced tea (mango & mint). lots of champagne if thats what you fancy and plenty of delicious desserts or chocolates. the staff are smartly dressed and friendly and polite.
"i purchased some delicious chocolate here last week to bring home from my trip. the women that helped my (name begins with a y) was very friendly and helpful. the price for the chocolate was a little on the high side, but the were delicious."
"with a tag line of chocolates and champagne you may be tempted to pass by, but i checked the menu, and am glad i did. i had neither champagne nor chocolates. after 2 gruelling days chasing around the benelux grabbing fast food when i could it was lovely to be able to sit down in pleasant surroundings, light jazz in the back ground and have a well cooked and prepared filet steak with a glass of red.they did not have the starter i wanted (a tomato tarte tatin with goats cheese) so i had the larger of the steak options -- lablled madame or monsieur ‚Ç¨23.50 or ‚Ç¨31 respectively. with broccoli and parsnip gratin (that i thought was potato-- not a parsnip fan) and a lovely bernaise sauce. good service and quality presentation-- even my tap water came in a cut glass. compared with all the other offerings on this side of the airport it was fantastic."
"cafe coco is one of the few places in schiphol where you can get table service. the coffee is expensive, but good and you get some fine chocolate with it. their yoghurt with granola is good and so are their other food options."
"our fllight had a 2 1/2 hour delay , so we sat there and had a coffee and desse "
"i had the unexpected pleasure of sampling dinner and breakfast (due to flight cancellation). the attraction was the fabulous pralines which are matched to the drinks on the menu for maximum enjoyment. however, the food i also ate was amazing! absolutely incredible - forgot i was in the airport. i had crispy salmon with lime risotto for dinner - and baked eggs for ham and mushrooms for breakfast. just delicious. i also had a glass of champagne with the smallest bubbles - giving a fabulous smooth taste. i cannot think of a better way to pass the time awaiting your flight."
"discovered this place by accident at the beginning of the year, now its my favourite place for a coffee at schiphol airport. great service, loving the crockery too!"
what an absolute treat for a layov 
"if your back is aching and your feet are tired after the miserable ordeal of schiphols security and immigration queues, why not skip the bustle and rush of schiphol airports many quick-serve snack bars, and look for caf√© coco in lounge 2, near the d gates. for an airport, the food was good: i had the encrusted salmon, on a bed of asparagus, and laced with caviar and cress. i savoured every bite. the ma√Ætre dh√¥te was quick to recommend a sancerre by jolivet as a companion wine. he was spot on: it complemented the salmon and caviar beautifull "
"beautifully presented and wonderfully tasty food - a lovely surprise in the hectic rush of the airport - we felt relaxed and able to enjoy the food, and retain our holiday calm."
"relaxed atmosphere, delicious food and desserts, beautiful food presentation and very friendly staff. thank you!"
"we had a tomato tart, quiche, tea and pecan tart before our flight. this was in fact the best meal we had on our trip to amsterdam - beautiful setting and good service - really worth the rather high prices"
"i like the lobster soup! is really good. i ordered steak which is really tasty except the portion a bit small. the cappuccino is heavenly... must try, cones with a piece of handmade chocolate."
"in addition to the deserts i took being delicious, i was surprised to find this level of  presentation and attention to details in an airport cafe.  i sat at the bar, and the service there was excellent.  definitely recommend wholeheartedly."
"the whole layout is a delight and the staff friendly, service with a genuine smile at last. the food is a delight to the eye and does not disappoint, with pricing very reasonable for an airport establishment i would recommend a visit if you are between flights or just waiting for yours. coffee in a very relaxed atmosphere is heaven"
we choose this little bistro at schiphol airport because it looked a bit more cosy than the standard restaurants and food shops. 8/10 the service was fine 8/10 the furniture and decoration fine too 8/ 
generally always disappointed with airport food . lunch was delicious. it may be a bit more than other places but worth it.
my flight was delayed so needed to get something to eat.  was happy with what i had and of coffee was great.
"i looked around schiphol for something other than fast food, i spotted the champagne logo and then the desserts. i had to stop  "
"located in lounge 2, cafe coco looks very attractive with the high-backed chairs and a good atmosphere in the busy airport setting of schiphol. the ambiance and service were gre "
i stopped again on my way through schiphol. service is better this time around. vega super food salad lovely as was montagne de babylon dessert.
"overall a bit over priced. waiters are a bit aloof not the best service in the world. but the coffee was good for buying it in the airport & it came with a little chocolate! i also got a chocolate croissant which wasnt favorable. it was a plain croissant with chocolate sauce dripped on the top of it. i personally prefer when the chocolate is inside. i didnt have a meal, though others food looked good."
"our flight was delayed by 2 hours, so we needed a place to chill out and have dinner. cafe coco was a welcome alternative to all the other restaurants in the vicinity. we had the vegetarian option, mushroom tortellini for ‚Ç¨18. it was delicious and very usual. i also had the tartetatin tomato for ‚Ç¨10.90. "
best flat white and best service accompanied by the best chocolate and absolute best crockery. please please offer it for sale to customers!
"our profound thanks to our waitress alice for her excellent service in the restaurant coco, schiphol airport on 12th of may 2016 kind regards solange and martinus from brazil"
"this is a pleasant spot to wait for your flight. its tucked away from the crowds and overlooks the aprons. food is very good. i had the mushroom tortellini which usually but also rather pleasantly surprised was served with long stem broccoli, butter squash, parmesan cheese and truffle oil. it was wonderful. service was great. the only slight complaint is that despite being table service one has to go to the till to pay. "
excellent espresso with complimentary chocolate. i enjoyed it so much i ordered a second one. its a bit more expensive but quality is good.
"cafe coco is a new addition (?) to dining experience at the airport. the lobster soup is good; tea and sandwiches tasty, porcelain service and table cloth, and attentive service. however, it takes a while to pay, so watch your time."
"restaurant located next to reception area. the menu selection is not big; however, food is delicious."
very nice experien to enjoy some very good dishes. eccellent and friendly service and helped to stretch our weak currency a bit. recommend it definitely!
"i had a caesar salad with prawns and lemongrass soup for a lunch, then a rib eye and fries for a dinner. while i was a bit disappointed with the wine selection the food was superb and the atmosphere relaxing. all the staff was pleasant, polite, and helpful. perhaps a bit more expensive than similar dining experiences but very convenient as a hotel restaurant for a weary traveler. "
"we were staying at the radisson blu for one night and, since we were car-less, we decided to try the hotels restaurant -- and were certainly glad we did. otium has a smart/casual atmosphere with its expanse of windows and its modern decor. the bar staff was amazing (even fixing a drink that they had to look up) and the wait staff was efficient and very friendly. the food was superb and just the right quantity. if we lived closer, we would definitely go back!"
"we were staying at the radisson blu and wanted a quick bite. the area around the radisson is a large mostly tec oriented business park and devoid of restaurants, so it was the otium or the shuttle to the airport. we sat at the bar and ordered from the dinner menu. mostly appetizers and finger food. it was very goo "
we reserved a table by the window and had a pretty view of the grounds. it was our anniversary and the staff treated us like royalty. i had the filet and my husband had the tuna - both were excellent. hightly recommend.
"went there for my birthday, we didnt book in adance but still our waitress was really accomodating and find us a very good tabl "
this restaurant is in the radison blu schiphol airport hotel. we were staying at the hotel for the last 2 days of a 29 day european vacation... our 2nd visit to amsterdam during that tim 
"we had requested different food items to the ones mentioned in the menu. the staff were very courteous and adhered to our tastes. the food was customized to our requirements and was delivered fast. we had the best pizza and curry! would highly recommend it,"
"very good service and surprisingly good fare for a restaurant lounge at an airport hotel. its a bit pricey, which you expect, but a good value in a nice atmosphere."
the staff her are always friendly and greet you with a smile the food is presented very tastefully by the chef good selection to choose from a very enjoyable evening that is never rushed
"very good food and you can eat all day ,price is okay a good menu and personal service aftera long day travelling itsa good place to be"
"we were looking for a light meal after a long travel day. at first we thought the menu prices were a bit high. however, after enjoying our meal we thought it was worth it. we had the tuna starter and the caesar salad with prawns. both were fresh and delicious. the tuna was seared perfectly. the caesar salad was large and definitely enough for a main meal. our server (kimberley i think) was perfect. she recommended a chardonnay to accompany our meal and it was very good. we were very pleased with the food and the service."
"breakfast here before heading down town was a great experience. delicious, varied menu, at a fair and reasonable price. you wont be disappointed."
the restaurant is in the radisson  the waiters are nice but service can be a bit slow the food is good and there is a good variety of drinks thomas
burgers in the bar were very good if pricey. not a great choice of bar snacks. table service for drinks and food. staff very good.
"great welcome and very tasty, delicate fo "
the food presented was excellent and so was the taste. drinks were excellent too. the staff were superb and very friendly and efficient. visited here twice during our stay and found it 1st class at both occassions.
"helpful staff and very tasty food. i really enjoyed eating here.the hamburger,club sandwich, and the falafel burger were excellent"
the food was really good nice steak nice it a bit princely but what to expect for a restaurant in a radisson hotel.
superb food and very friendly service. brilliant steak most welcome after 3 hour delay getting from gatwick. puddings were very good indeed. great start to our holiday.
"others have unfavourable review of this place about service so i thought to check it out myself ! i did not find it bad service i think they give you enough time to enjoy the place and relax , the service is not as fast as other restaurant is but we find it quite relaxing after a busy day to enjoy the wine while waiting for our food ! great rustic ambiance , they grow their herbs in their balcony garden , its located in the prime of la besides the new broad museum, 300 ft from the disney concert hall , in front of moca and 500 ft to the dorothy chandler opera house and 2 blocks from the la cathedral!! a great treat for any tourist !! the food is awesomely good , you can try anything and you cant go wrong ! energetic bar , great selection of wines and exciting clientele !!"
"the otium restaurant is situated in the radison hotel about a 10 minute drive from schiphol airport. we looked for a casual business diner at a close distance to the airport and were very pleasantly surprised. a tasty otium salad and perfectly prepared steaks were served most promptly. no hassle, superb service. perfect for a pleasant and efficient business diner."
"had a table for 4, for a dinner with 3 of my colleagues, whilst we stayed in the hotel. i though the prices a little high, but the customer service was excellent. sand choices, steak burger and chicken but my colleague ha date fish and thought it was good."
"we had a very nice dinner. excellent food, nice tasting and the service was very correct. wine was served adjusted at the different course. outstanding restaurant!"
"had a dinner here while staying at the radisson blu hotel. i went for the 3 course option with winepackage. it was very price worthy. the langoustine-mousse as starter was a bit blend in taste, the skrei for main course was so much better. but the flan for dessert is what i remember mo "
"when we first stayed at the radisson blu hotel amsterdam schiphol airport in 2014 for a 2 days board meeting we were astounded by the quality of the food and service provided at otium lounge & restaurant. returning to the radisson blu again in december 2015 we booked lunch at otium. to say it was one of the best meals i have eaten is a bold statement but i can confirm this is true. the new ambience and design of the restaurant is world class. our food was perfectly cooked and the wine advise was excellent to compliment the food. i cant recommend otium enough. all i can say is that if you appreciate extremely good food and wine you have to dine at otium, trust me you will not be disappointed. i look forward to have lunch and/or diner their again when we return to the radisson blu. keep it up!"
"the food was ok and staff was friendly. the starter ceasar salad was good but a bit too much. the ribeye was perfect. the food was not that hot, little bit on the cold side. also the lobster soup."
"my husband had a caesar salad with chicken, pinon nuts, capers,anchovies and was a standard american size serving. i had a blue cheese burger which was cooked exactly as i ordered and the flavor of the angus beef was delicious. the tomato relish was an added accent. the service was cordial and the atmosphere relaxing after a long flight. the prices were moderate and in line with other hotel restaurant pric "
"this restaurant is in the radisson blu hotel at schiphol. the menu presented a decent variety of offerings from snacks to multi course meals. my wife and i shared a salad and then split the burger and a risotto. both offerings were very nicely prepared and presented. we also shared a serving of fries and a bottle of a very decent spanish red wine. there was a definite dutch touch to the food preparation. the server was pleasant, helpful and attentive. the cost was just over 80 euros."
we had a light dinner.  the food is very expensive comparing to the rest of restaurants in amsterdam.
we ate at this restaurant on the day we arrived rather than travel in to amsterdam. the food was very tasty but quite expensive and portions were not large. the menu was quite limited but we only ate here once so that wasnt a problem.
my husband and i went there yesterday for my birthday. impressive food and service!!! such a big surprise:) will definitely go there very soon!
much better than a lot of hotel fodder. the restaurant has an interesting menu with various options. i ate here twice and both times enjoyed everything. service was very good as well.
food was really good with several selection of wine from the list. those who attended our table were fantastic. very attentive!
after a long flight home i came to mc donald‚Äôs drive through located close to schiphol airpor 
"i normally wouldn‚Äôt be hitting the mcdonalds for breakfast, but was in a hurry at the airport and it was great! despite being very busy, they served the food very quickly and everything tasted great! i would have thought i was back in the usa eating at a local mcdonalds! they do have a very nice seating around with plenty of places to plug in your electronics before getting on the plane as well! :)"
"really, i was hungry and tired, i had no idea that in holand there were shrimps in mcdonalds. it was so amazing!!!!!"
"a mcdonald such as you should expect, easy order and pay by selfservice kiosk, fast ready and taste as usualy in the netherlands. we took a quick quarterpounder menu and chicken crisps. typical mcdo service, friendly and efficient."
"rated very good for the overall experience as you can order and pay for your food using the self service kiosk machines. you can customize as you wish. they do have a vegetarian option which actually looks like chicken. it was nice of the staff to confirm to me that it was indeed vegetarian even though it looks like meat. was just average tasting though. if you are looking for a quick reasonably priced meal, this is the place to eat before going on your flight."
"i dont eat much in the mcdonald, but when i go to other countries, i would love to try one, and yes! there are some different taste and quality of food, and that the beauty of traveling around the world to get a variaty of taste."
"we found the food to be good and the prices to be reasonable for airport food.  we live in africa, so we dont get fast food very often."
this is your typical mcdonalds restaurant at schiphol. food is served quick and thats what they should do.
"waiting for a plane home its always good to have a mcdonalds,and this was no exception, hot and lovely and the frites klein were as good as they come"
convenient location close to the ibis hotel and a bus station with direct link to the city center. also good to do some spotting as it overlooks a big part of the airport.
we stopped  in for a late night snack and to my surprise the food was fabulous!!! we americans love our burgers but dam  knows how to  make a  burger! fresh and fabulous!!!
it seems like it was very popular among tourists at the time we were waiting for our flight. we dont eat at this restaurant in the us except for smoothies and lattes but didnt mind at all to grab a bite. plus that portion of the airport was under construction and didnt look very inviting and accommodation :(.
my order was served very quickly but after waiting a while to actually being served by the staff who seems to be stood around doing not alot!
i cannot remember the last time i had a mcdonalds but it must be many many years ago - over 10 at lea 
mcdonalds is always good for  quick & cheap bite. so we needed eating up here.  the food & cleanliness was good
"schiphol is huge and when rushing from gate to gate, where time is limited, it is great to see the good old mcdonalds sign, and small restaurant. great to grab a snack or coffee as you pass b "
we have been in panda some 10 years ago frequently.when visiting family and friends in the netherlan 
nice modern terrace with comfortable seating and friendly service. they served me a delicious spicy tender chicken sandwich and good coffee.
"whether you use their terrace or use their restaurant, youll enjoy a proper meal from a menu with plenty of choice. we come back every now and then if we want to be sure to have a good meal and a good time accordingly."
the restaurant is located in the center of heerde. the food is very good and tastefully prepared. the atmosphere is cozy and the service is quick and nice. the vegetarian can also eat here very well
"i went for a high tea with my mom and sister, it was vedy well arranged and the bites were very tasty. also the tea was very special, with a carrousel of flavours explaining whats what. i will definitely come back next time."
"always with smile and good service from tim and maikel. this spring they introduced a new menu...very nice and good choices, value for money. great place to go !!"
"nice place e, friendly staff, good simple food!   very good price/quality !   nice cosy atmosphere.a must for a modest budget."
on the outskirts of heemstede with enough parkings spaces in front of restaurant you¬¥ll find this restaurant easy going and good value for money. good service and very good food.
"after a wonderful day at the play ground we walked out and tried the fries right by the entrance. these were the best fries i have had, crispy with skin on and soft from inside. eaten with a dollop of mayonnaise these hot crispy golden potato fingers made me feel guilty with pleasure. wish i had picked up one at the beginning of the day as well."
"a small, un-pretentious italian restaurant in heemstede serving tasty italian food for a very good price. the surroundings are modest but the food is very good. service is very friendly."
"more than passable italian food with a dutch-touch (this is holland so manage your expectations!). pizzas are reasonable (not really what you would get in italy), and the rest of the menu offers a good choice. decent wine choice. very polite servi "
"this is a great restaurant for people who love pizza and pasta.  the pizzas were great, and you just had to finish all of it.  i would definitely recommend this restaurant to others."
"this was a great restaurant near where we stayed.  there was very friendly service and great food.  we were seated right next to the pizza oven, and got to watch our pizza get made."
nice and cozy place. on the main street of heemstede. fine ambiance and very good service. ideal place to meet with friends.
"my wife realy enjoys this italian restaurant, it is child friendly and the staff is very helpful. there is also an older italian man which is really focusing on details and customer experience so all with all this is our favorite restaurant near our home!"
"weve been to la via numerous times and have always enjoyed our meal.  homemade, tasty, and at a very reasonable price.  the service is very good and their menu selections are many."
"i was there on business dinner. menu is real great, but without english translation. so some of meals you have to guess as the waitress also didnt speak english. anyway nothing to claim about food, it was fresh, wonderful scallops and real well made ravioli. i think it is right place for family dinner , but fits also for business lunch or dinner. parking is possible on the street free after 6pm."
"i take out every other week and love their pizzas! my wife always takes the parmigiana. when eating in, the pastas (gorgonzola) saltinbocca and salmone diavola are my favorite. limoncello as dessert. :)"
"i have been here a few times over the last 4 years and it hasnt changed much. the menu is authentic, the bruschetta is awesome and so is the melanzane parmiagiana. the pizza and other pasta offerings have also been appreciated by my companions in the past ( i have been here with real italians and they liked i "
went here as we were looking for something different. firstly the ambiaunce of the restaurant is excellent with a mix of internal and external areas. the 5 course taster menu was excellent with an a la carte on some australian dishes. will be back in large numbers! the only thing that would make it better is ink gin on the menu!
"the most beautiful food and restaurant we‚Äôve been to recently. start to finish it was incredibly fabulous, food is so beautiful and we only wish we weren‚Äôt just visiting so could return! couldn‚Äôt recommend highly enough, def worth the trip!"
"had a  fantastic evening catching up with friends  . the  tasting menu paired with some incredible wines was excellent . a wonderful menu , good  impact and good wine . despite the snow ! yes unexpected snow the evening wasa real success"
"bloody brilliant üíû 3rd time ive been here and it seems to only get better. from the delicious food to the excellent wine arrangement. from the hospitable personell to the hard working owner herself, everything is excellent üëå"
"absolutely one of our best dining experiences in the netherlands, the food is delicious and exquisite. we had the 5 course tasting with matching wines. service was impeccable. if you haven‚Äôt been or are thinking of going you should! we will definitely go again."
"we visited the restaurant last night for the first time. the service was excellent, friendly, attentive staff make a world of difference to an evening. the food was delicious, everything was cooked to perfection."
"it is a long time ago we rated a restaurant with 5! stars. but here its earned easily. perfect staff, perfect hospitality, great accompanied wines, perfect dishes, for this lhigh evel of cuisine a very good price rate. beautifull tasty dishes with suprising sometimes mindblowing combinatio "
"wonderful degustation menu. kangaroo, crocodile, a remix of a golden gaytime. super fun evening with lovely wine pairings. good selection of australian beers as well. expensive but worth it for a special occasion. who thought australian food could be so fancy. 10 out of 10 night. "
"on a regular basis we have dinner at southern cross in heemstede, like last saturday with frien "
"great, innovative dishes, with a wonderful selection. other reviewers have noted that it can be noisy and we found that to be true- even with just four of us around the table. service was very friendly but really slow- we didn‚Äôt care because we were catching up- and when we did alert the wait staff that we wanted to leave by a certain time, they hurried up our dessert ord "
"we went there, in this rather noisy restaurant. it has a really atmosphere though noisy. the restaurant is frequenter a lot therefore a reservation is necessary. the servants are professional and aquinted. the menu is australian based though adapter to the european taste."
"you may be wondering why i am writing a review again, as i have written many reviews of southern cross over the years. it is my favourite restaurant in town "
"southern cross is located in heemstede, just outside the city center. this makes it an accessible location for any transport. the interior of this restaurant is modern and trendy designed with comfortable seating "
"the fish is the best thing they have on offer, i would recommend this to anyone who is in the area. even if it‚Äôs for a quick bite to eat."
"we decided to try this restaurant thanks to the positive reviews and we were completely satisfied, the staff was kind and welcoming, the 5-course menu in february was very tasty and creative, and wines were just perfect"
"ive eaten here many times to celebrate birthdays and what not, and every time it is a treat. the menu is very tasty, with some very australian dishes (kangaroo, ostrich or crocodile anyone?), always prepared to a very high standard. the wine selection is amazing. the menu changes often enough to keep this restaurant fresh and innovative. staff is always kind and welcoming. looking forward to our next visit!"
we are very regular visitors of southern cross as it has a consistent high quality and an excellent price / quality rat 
the dishes look beautiful and taste good. price menu e35 and quality is go 
"we are regulars at southern cross, first and foremost because it serves excellent and creative food, and also because it is very close to ho "
"from the moment we entered the restaurant and the owner welcomed us until the end of the evening and we went home, we had an amazing evening. the knowledge of the wines, the enthusiastic stories, the fantastic food and the brilliant attendance of the serving ladies was the best experience ever. do go there!"
"what a great pleasure to visit this restaurant! delicious australian mixed with asian fusion food. choose the 6 course surprise menu and every course is a huge pleasure to taste, see and experience especially with the well chosen wine "
"southern cross always delivers on quality in food and service. if you are into modern australian with oriental influences this is a great place. after several visits we are always pleased to return to the warm and personal welcome of the host, of a level you do not often find in the netherlands. we find the price vs quality well worth it and will return time and again for sure to discover the changes in the menu.."
"we enjoyed a 7-course menu tonight. it was fantastic. from the start with a sparkling shiraz on the terras until thw coffee with sweets. beautiful entourage, super friendly staff and the food and wines are just perfect. we are looking forward to our next visit!"
"we discovered this fantastic restaurant thanks to friends of us who live in heemstede, and we have been here many years over the last 10 years and we love it every single time. fantastic food with great wines in a beautiful setting, and highly recommendable for any aussies who would love a top notch australian food experience whilst abroad. australians will be even happier to know that the menus are priced half (or less than that) of what they would cost at a similar restaurant in sydney or melbourne (35 euro / 50 aud for an amazing three course meal). even though the place is packed every night of the week they havent raised their prices which proves all the more how highly sympathetic the staff are. heemstede is only 15 to 20 minutes by train from central station and from heemstede-aerdenhout station its just a 5 to 10 minute walk. you wont get australian food this good down under, so get it here - but be sure to book ahead!"
its often hard to reserve a table. i often tried but failed. this time i was lucky to book my birthday dinner there with fami 
"this restaurant is one of my favourites since 2002. the cuisine, the service are perfect, never had a mediocre experience, always high level and absolutely consistent, thanks to the focus of the owners and the very very determined staff that make this place so loved!"
"we visited this wonderful establishment last night, and i am still glowing from the memory of the experien "
"on of the few real australian restaurant in the netherlands. owner peter, his wife and the rest of the staff make you feel very welcome. food is out of this world, perhaps from another planet. on warm evenings you can dine outside."
"although acoustics are not great, this is a restaurant to come back to, for the quality of the food, the excellent service and the nice atmosphe "
"when you tell someone they should visit a restaurant because its good, people assume youre talking about a pleasant place with decent food for good pricing. this restaurant deserves more than the label good: its absolutely outstanding. the food is extraordinary, the flavors are a thrilling experience for your tastebuds. they have various fish and meat options and one vegetarian option, each with totally different taste panels. some dishes are spicy and make you think of the asian influences in the australian area, other dishes are typical australian. the service is also on point: friendly without being clingy."
"this restaurant combines flair and excellence in all it does. its difficult choosing from a menu that includes kangaroo, emu, crocodile and also guinea fowl. all the meats are very tender, flavorful and have touches of unexpected flavors and textures, the mark of a creative kitchen. the welcome is warm, like friends who havent seen each other for a while but pick up where they left. the waiting staff knows how to pair australian wines with the dishes. leave it to them."
the staff are attentive with excellent suggestions. the wine list is quite extensive and the food delicious.   highly recommended
"a great experience all round. good food, no pr stunts, good service and general feeling of being welcome. recommended for a good evening out with friends or family. you cannot go wrong, whether a meat eater or a veggie!"
"first time trying australian dishes and i do not regret. great experience! service top! wine pairing excellent! hope to visit you soon again, guys!"
"nice and cosy, easy going service, perfect food, perfect service.  food is excellent on the flamboyant side, just like its chef ;-) go!"
outstanding service and a warm welcome when we came back again. southern cross has constant quality changing a menu to choose from and once again we were very happy. our hostess natasja is such a warm personality that the outstanding dinner can hardly be beaten. natasja also selected the wines accompanying our dinner and this what you should do. she knows so well to choose the right wine for the dish. in short...go and experience yourself !!
"amazing food and wines and fantastic service. a great place for small and bigger anniversaries, the southern cross has been offering the same outstanding quality for years now."
"for mothers day we had dinner here. it was our first time. some of the dishes are a little complicated but always well thought out and tasty. great wines too and excellent service. no worries if you dontt want to eat kangaroo or alligator, there is beef too. delicious cr√®me brulee."
"allways fully booked but when i reserved a place on a warm summerday they had held two tables, one outside and one inside, apart for me and my friends. so we could choose. the service and the food on that day and other days was excellent. rarelly been served better elsewhere!"
"i always make sure we visit this great gem of a restaurant. its a great looking place that has a easy going vibe, a superb menu and the best staff. the owners are welcoming couple that always make you feel like home. this place holds a special place in my heart and our vacation is not complete with at least a few appetizers in this place. the prices are more then reasonable especially considering all the food served here is of the highest quality/flavor/presentatio "
"living in the uk myself but fortunately haveing family living nearby this is our/my favorite place to visit for a wonder dining experience. from the very exciting taste combination to the high quality of ingredients, the ambiance and the very attentive staff, all details are covered and you will leave with a great smile on your face. my dietary issues are dealt with a smile and great ease. so the only problem will be what new excuse you can think off to book a return visit : ) thank you natasha, peter and all the staff x"
i started wi 
been there with friends - big family - 2 adults and 3 kid 
good australian food reasonanable price. it is a nice place to have dinner with friends and family not too far from our home.
"during our 5 days stay in amsterdam, we ate out for most of our meals, including some pretty high end restaurants in the city proper. little did we know that our universally favourite place would be this australian restaurant! being adventurous, we tried the crocodile, ostrich, and kangaroo among other things, and most of us ordered the 3-course meal. we were not disappointed - the food was incredible, prepared with care and every bite was a dre "
"we found this little pearl on friday to learn there are no free tables. managed to get a booking for a next day though and it was worth it! 3-courses menu give you a curious choice of dishes you would never have a chance to try anywhere else. we went for a crocodile, an ostrich and some fish, finished by cr√®me br√ªl√©e and a chocolate cake. ostrich was a highlight of the evening, a fine meat, better than any beef i have ever eaten. cozy interior, great for family meetings, dates and parties. lovely and friendly service as well. we will surely get back if we get a chance! well recommended! not a surprise it has such good reviews!"
"what a lovely restaurant! we went there for my grandmother-in-laws birthday and the experience was brilliant! a nice selections of diverse meats all cooked to perfection with great tastes! the service was also very good, polite and friendly! great experience will go again!"
"this is a wonderful restaurant. the service is impeccable and personal. the items on the menu are unique, creative and fabulous. i almost hesitate to give such a positive review as i dont want crowds to find out about it!"
very nice atmosphere.  nice staf and real aussie food make sure you have a reservation specially during friday saturday
"eat kangaroo, ostrich and the ever changing deserts! this is a must go to restaurant. great food great service. house wine very acceptable. the ‚Ç¨35 dinner is very good value. book in advance for weekends!"
"fusion so new exiting combinations of food with a perfect presentation nice wine and good service, give it a try"
a very good australian restaurant. the wines are very tastefull and the people are great. make sure you have a reservation and you will have a great evening.
"3 course dinner, amazing tastes and choices, really exceptional !! the atmosphere in this place is so awesome, the personnel so friendly and attention full. the kitchen produces each and overtime high quality food...go there and try for yourself !! recommended !"
just great! attention to detail is very high and this australian cuisine is very well met by the great australina wines they are able to serve! really a great night out in a lovely atmosphere. certainly when you go for the menu du chef tasting menu with wine package. however also the 3 course menu has some superb specialtys like the venison. just love to go there!
"the variety of dishes is excellent, and some of them you wont find inn the area. always busy, good sign for fresh food. have been there twice now and for sure will go again. one of he best places in heemstede and perhaps haarlem"
"great australian food, well presented and prepared, friendly staff and cool atmosphere. what can i say more..."
"constant quality, wonderful food and great service. our favorite for years already. great valse for money!"
"kangaroo, crocodile or tropical fish. southern cross always has very  good australian food. exotic, but tasteful. staff is friendly and helpful. ample space and good seats."
"southern cross in certain ways is hidden from tourists, it is located in a little city 30min from amstetdam. it is very typical and has very good food. i was amazed with the menu, literally. there was everything- duck, crocodile, kanguru, crab - between many others. other comment about the food is that not only has a big variety but it is very well prepared- maybe bigger portions could be advisable. for a starter,main course and dessert the price is ‚Ç¨33 which is a high price based on other restaurants in the region. to conclude, i strongly recommend the best australian restaurant in holland. "
"every time we visit is great food, nice people excellent wine and a very good price go there and enjoy"
"it was not the first time that we had a wonderful meal here. the food keeps a constant high quality and the menu is always surprising. we had steak tartare and chicken liver parfait for starters and as main course rack of lamb and the vegetarian goat cheese dish, all very good. of course we finished with a great desert a chocolate mouse plate and pavlova with lemongrass ice cream. friendly staff and a good atmosphere, you can sit in the garden or inside. highly recommended! "
"great food, unique food and a great experience. one of my favorite restaurants. its possible to eat all kinds of different authentic australian animals and it taste great. only complaint that it is a bit noisy. but that is mainly because it so popular"
"we went there based on the good critics on tripadvisor, and were quite lucky to get a table for two on the saturday evening, as the restaurant was packed. we wrote an e-mail in the morning, they called back and proposed us a table, very efficient and nice. we decided to try a 5 course surprise menu. the first course was good (scallops with pesto and parmesan), but not extraordinary, but after that it got better with every course. the cod, the lamb and then the kangaroo were really good, the lamb being probably the best lamb dish we ever had. we would not have chosen it from the menu, but we definitely would have missed something there. the surprise course has a very decent price for the quality served, but the wine card is quite expensive, but you get some good wines. service was impeccable and the atmosphere is good. unfortunately it will be difficult to be back, as were not living close by."
"a little taste of australia in heemstede! we went with a group of friends and we all had the tasting menu... absolutely delicious! food & wine were great, service fantastic and the place itself had excellent atmosphere. have recommended to several friends and we will most definitely come here again! "
"great restaurant with an indoor garden, great food an wines and normal prices. in the weekend you must make an reservation otherwise you have to wait at the bar for a table."
"great value for money,  very friendly service. the menu is unexpected and suits all tastes. the crocodile bitterballen are to die for...and the wines too. make sure you book in advance."
"that is what the title of this review is. and southern cross definitely went beyond my expectations. i was with a friend whos from ozzieland herself and she was surprised. all the food is imported from australia and the chef gave a dutch twist to the bitterballen with crocodile in it, and the kangaroo was also delicious to the fullest, and my ozzie friend thought the angus steak she had was also perfect. perfect wine, ambiance, food and prices too! (70‚Ç¨ for two pax, one 3-course menu and a starter and maincourse "
"we had a great evening here together. we filled the online from for a reservation, where i said we had not been there for a long time, since we do not live around and more. but we were in town and would love to come to diner while and grandma and grandpa would babysit our son. there was actualy no room left, be this is such a great place with two tables at the entrance / bar where you van normaly not eat. he aside us whether we wanted to start there, and go to another table later. great! we would love to. super service! we went for the surprise menu and had 6 super delicious courses with very diverse food. so tasty, kind people and allahs worth it to go back here!"
"great food, great service, great staff. we devoured our meals, then (half) joked about the small portions. 10 minutes later...2 extra main courses, served with a smile! but dont just take my word for it. go and find out for yourselves."
"weve had dinner at southern cross several times a year, since it has opened its doors in 2002. chef peter and his wife natasja run a perfect place. youre welcomed as soon as you enter. atmosphere breathes australia, staff is experienced, friendly and knows how guests want to be treated. it is fine-dining at his best. the menu has a choice of fish, meat and vegetarian. anyone will find something he likes. bread/butter and table water are complimentary, just the way it should be. i must say ‚Ç¨ 33,50 for a three course dinner is a bargain by any means for a restaurant in the west of the netherlands. presentation and taste of the food is on a michelin-star-level. keep up your good work! well be back."
"we have now been to this restaurant a third time and we are simply amazed at the consistency with the customer experience we received. the food continues to delight albeit we missed some of the the dishes in the previous menu. the service was warm, friendly and prompt as usual. it is proving to be a hard act to follow by other restaurants we have been to - several of which have had the same good reviews. but nothing beats consistency - and this is where its thumbs up for southern cross for us. "
"we walked in on a monday night while the restaurant was nearly full. luckily there was 1 table left for us. the staf is well mannered, experienced and has knowledge. we waited for some time before the menu and drinks were served. the menu exists of some 8 starters, 8 mains and 8 desserts. we had crocodile and melon as starters. we had lobster and steak as main course with a superb red wine from longhorn creek."
"we were hooked from the moment the starters arrived. beautifully presented, created with care and completely delicious. main course had a tough act to follow but did not disappoin "
"a colleague recommended the restaurant to us and given it was close enough to where we live, we decided to give it a go. we made a booking on the day itself and was lucky to get a table. we were running late as our grocery home delivery arrived later than expected. we called the restaurant to apologize and they told us not to worry about being late, and i our table would be ready for us. we got to the restaurant and were immediately served and made to feel very welcome. we ordered the 3-course meal and were treated to a truly marvelous dining experience. the pork loin and steak dishes are to die for. this has clearly become one of our favorite restaurants. "
"this restaurant is a favorite of ours. the menu changes frequently, but always indicates original australian cuisine. there is a good guidance to choose the appropriate wine. the service is excellent and very friendly."
real fine dining. peter has an excellent creative mind. and everything tastes wonderful!!! and natasha is a great hostess. best restaurant in heemstede
"southern cross is a badly kept secret. for those of us who have discovered southern cross but still have to book well ahead of a table, their success is our loss ! the restaurant is located on the main road from heemstede to zandvoort. in the summer you can eat outside when warm enou "
"social business dinner, including wife and son of one of our colleagues that had earlier lived in melbourne.  great menu -- interesting choices including crocodile and kangaroo for those that want to try something different from half a world away."
"fantastic menu with australian and european dishes, well-prepared, beautifully served. many interesting appetizers, creative desserts, strong main courses. price-value is very good.  wine selection is excellent. tru the wine arrangement. on a saturday night completely full. located in a quiet neigborhood near haarlem."
each and every time we went for dinner at southern-cross we had a choice out wonderful dish 
good food with sometimes the australian touch and fair prices. sometimes a bit noisy when there are groups around. nice wine list.
"challenging mix of foods combined to wonderful courses in which the diverse cuisine of australia can be tasted. attentive and well trained staff. dutch style house with typical australian elements and aboriginal art. personal touch by owners. definately worth a visit even more visits, even when you have never been in australia before. "
you can be sure that everything that you will order going to be a perfect match on the plate. moreover wines are excellent and the prices are correct. from the guesting till serving everything is well organised. everybody was helpful and friendly.
"a fine restaurant, going strong for the last 5 or 6 years. we have been here several times with australian friends and relatives. both the dutch and the australians enjoyed the food and the friendly service."
"very tasty food and good atmosphere. the menu is not very large but it includes very special dishes like crocodile, cangaroo,  but also very nice traditional plates, like an excellent rack of lamb. the house wine was perfect too. very friendly and attent service"
"i came across this restaurant in a bizarre way as i was sent a voucher by qantas airways after a bad flight; but i am very glad they did it. this is an exceptional restaurant in the netherlands, and the only one where the canadian who accompanied me ever commended it on its service in over two years in the count "
"we have been visiting southern cross frequently for the past 10 years and were never disappointed. the food is adventurous, tasty and prepared with great care. plan your visit well in advance as there always seems to be a rush to the restaurant. once youve been there you will understand why! cheers to natasja, peter and staff...keep up the great standard!"
once again we went to southern-cross and again it was very a very enjoyable experience. we choose the set menu offering six choices per cour 
"i ate here with some ducth friends who loved the place. i had some reservations about an australian fusion restaurant in the netherlands. however these were unfounded. it sources good quality ingredients ( which is a theme that i see in other good dutch restaurants), and the quality of presentation is top class. i enjoyed the meal from start to finish and really enjoyed the wine that we had with it. pity i cant remember the brand "
"as we associated australian food with kangaroo and crocodile, we had not been here before. we heard that they also served excellent fish dishes, so we tried it o "
"try southern cross in heemstede, the netherlan "
"while the modern australian cuisine is receiving a lot of (positive) attention lately, there seems to be some confusion about what australian cuisine really is. and even after having dined on several occasions, i am still looking for differences between the modern australian cuisine of southern cross with other fusion cuisines. typical australian ingredients like crocodile, barramundi fish and kangaroo are used for some dishes but other dishes are mixtures between european, chinese and indian food, which is nothing new. perhaps, that is what australian is, an amalgam of various culture "
"this is a restaurant that cannot be beaten for great food beautifully presented by extremely well trained, delightful staff price,quality it is excellent. the wines are well chosen and to be honest there are no down sides to this restaurant. it is so popular with the locals that you would be wise to reserve a table well in advance, even up to 2 weeks at peak periods! during the week you maybe able to get a seat on the spur of the moment. "
"as you can read in the other reviews aswell this is a great restaurant. friendly service, different menu (kangaroo, crocodile, emu, etc. and a very good relation between price and quality (35 euro will get u 3 courses). australian wine, australian beer. don¬¥t forget to try the pavlova dessert accompanied by the 20 year old museum dessert wine."
"good menu. starter - main - sweets one price, great. you have to reserve a long time in advance as it is allways full. no wonder great value, service and wine chart. its worth the wait mate!"
"while walking down a street in heemstede, close to the main dutch airport, i saw the southern cross... while living in africa, the crois du sud gives me a total different idea, but i was curious and went in. it was a restaurant and we got a table outside in a pleasant gard "
"i have been quite often now in this restaurant and everytime again i am pleasantly surprised.....the food quality and variation is excellent, the price is very very friendly, the staff the best i know in this region! friendliness, knowledge and professionalism are key words. the owners peter and natasja work in the kitchen resp the restaurant and you really feel among friends!"
australian cuisine is not something you see around haarlem and heemstede. what can i sa 
i was surprised when one of my local colleagues recommended southern cross. id never been to an australian restaurant though ive been to australia a couple times. the food was great. had my first skate wing and tried a colleagues kangaroo and both were superb. who would think to look for australian food when visiting the netherlands? now i would. highly recommended.
"for only you 32,50 euro you can choose from a three-course menu of australian cook/owner peter. his dutch wife and her staff give your good information about the wines, and excellent service in general. menu withvery nice fusion choices and many good suprises. but one warning: try to book in advance because even during the week this favourite spot in the haarlem region often full-booked."
staff was super friendly. we were there with a bunch of kids and they immediately came over with pencils and paper. our order came fast and the pancakes were yummy!
"been here many times, our favorite pancake place.  we had the homemade asparagus soup which was lovely and very tasty. of course we had pancakes, and one of use had the sate with chips. all very nice.  yet another great visit, and well be back."
this is a family restaurant serving a wide variety of delicious pancakes. the restaurant was reasonably empty during our visit. service was quick & efficient and the food tasty. it is well worth a visit for people who want to indulge in good pancakes.
"impressive list of pancakes that appealed to all members of our family, but if pancakes aren‚Äôt your thing there‚Äôs other options such as salads, burgers and hashes. we sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere on a sunday evening- lots of local families with small children. pancakes themselves were huge and tasty. "
this is a lovely neighborhood restaurant that i try to visit each time i am in heemstede. it is warm and friendly with good food and service. this was my first visit in summer and the outdoor seating was perfect!
"have visited many times, the food is always excellent with a wide range there is something for everyone on the menu.  easy roadside parking.  the pancakes are large and filling.  would definitely recommend a visit."
"sunny weather, so we could sit outside on the couches, enjoying our beers after a hike in the kennermer waterleiding duinen area. busy place, good for pancakes. little childrens playing area, enjoyable little stay"
after a long walk in the woods it is a niceplace to eat pancakes a great assortiment  offcourse different dishes
"we have been here for dinner after visiting keukenhof. the savoury pancakes we had were good and the tiramis√π i had for dessert was fine. the price was honest, though not exceptionally low."
one of the best pancake restaurants ive ever bee. you name it theyll make a pancake of it. across the road from groenendaal forrest.
"my family and i with inlaws and aunt went here for pancakes at lunch time and really impressed. good portions, fresh made and scrumptious food. one can see why its been around so long - def worth a visit"
"on a sunday afternoon  it was very busy   nearly full service friendly ,in a few minutes perfect pancakes with a smile"
"been there 3 times this year, and prefer the pancakes from this restaurant above t panneland and de oase which are also close  "
nice shadowed places to sit  good pancakes and tiramisu parking no problem nice walking area oppposit
"the pancakes were delicious, and we were seated with a great view of the flower parade that, coincidentally, was happening at the time that we were eating."
"the pancakes were great here.  we did need to wait about 20 minutes before we got a table, but it was worth it to watch the flower parade!"
the pancakes at de konijnenberg were delicious.  the kids enjoyed the pancakes that they ordered.  i would definitely recommend a visit to this restaurant.  we also went during the keukenhof flower parade.  we could see all of the flowers through the restaurant window.
"really enjoy the food, nice menu... our kids enjoyed the evening too. very good service and very affordable prices. stop and eat something at this place"
"i have eaten here many times. it is a good place to visit after a walk through the groenendaal domain just accross the street. we usually had pancakes (it is a pancake-restaurant after all), but also try the sat√©, which is also very good. the restaurant is decorated with reproductions of old duch paintings. a great place for birthday parties with the kids. dogs are allowed in."
"this typically dutch restaurant, just across a beautiful walking-forest, you find this gem. known to every one in the surrounded area and... from much further away. i love this place. very friendly staff, nice visitors + (dogs !) and great, very great pancakes. try it.....!"
the best pancakes of the neighbourhood of haarlem. all sorts are possible. specially with children a good environment with on the other side of the road a park to walk.
a sunday afternoon favorite for dutch pancakes after a nice walk in the adjoining forest.  other options are available.  friendly staff and quick service.
"this is a so-called pancake house which is a common phenomenon in the netherlands, serving many variations of the dead-simple pancake primarily aimed at kids as all kids love pancakes. but the restaurant serves other typical dutch dishes t "
this restaurant was a real surprise to  
our dutch friends took us to this chinese retaurant because it is their favorite. it is now our favorite too! we were given a table overlooking the rear garden which was very pleasant. the food that came blew us away. the food was beautifully presented and was delicious and there was alot of it. the chef will also recommend sauces to go with the various dishes. i would go back here anytime.
"first time visiting and dining here.  the staff were very welcoming and friendly.  enjoyed a wonderful meal, it was excellent and would certainly go again!"
"delicious meal,l had the fried dumplings and mandarin duck,husband had soup and a beef dish which all were outstanding,husband said best chinese meal he has ever had!!"
"the food stands out. the service is impeccable, in the center of heemstede. and last but not least.. take away !! (believe me, you have to wait in line)."
"came here on the first night of our trip on the recommendation of our airbnb owners and we were not disappointed!! food was great. we had the sharing dishes (cant remember the name of them, sorry!) but im sure if you ask they will be able to tell you. everything tasted amazing and was very filling too. staff were also super friendly and helpf "
"this restaurant has, for years on end been able to invariably deliver the authentic indonesian rijsttafel experience. i can always smell it coming in. great !"
"the quality of the indonesian food is profound, very taste full and well proportioned. it is always a treat to eat at sari, i have got fiends you come from the south of the netherlands and must eat at saris"
"ive had the small rice table and ive felt bliss at every bite.  closing my eyes i really felt back in indonesia.  will definitely be back, best indonesian restaurant so far."
"the real idonisian cuisine like we dutch prefere this.  choice of spice , normal spicy , very spicy. do not hesitate to ask for spicy or very spicy. your mooth and lips will  tintle the friendly staff wil explain this perfectly."
"looking for a great place to have authentic indonesian rijsttafel? look no further! the dishes here are absolutely superb and tasty, and there are many side dishes to choose from to supplement your main course. the most difficult thing here is to choose what to eat!"
we had take-out from sari a number of times now. food is good quality in general. really liked the freshness of the gado gado vegetables which often is a mush covered in sate sauce.   great to have as your local indonesian around the corner.
"every time i visit the netherlands, a visit to this restaurant is included.  the food is excellent and the quality always remains the best."
we had a small rijstafel and extra sat√©. all the different cooked portions of beef and of vegatebels were of a different taste and were just like it is cooked or grilled in the original kitchen of indonesia. it is recommended to reserve in the restaurant.
"for years sari is named one of the top indonesian restaurants in the michelin guide. its been at least 5 years i enjoyed the famous indonesian rice table at sari and been telling my friends to go there. last saturday it was d-day for sari. i took six of my friends to the restaurant and we all know what indonesian food should taste like. it was more then delicious, we took a rice table for six and was more the enough. four different sate dishes and 4 different rendang, just tasted as how it should. the restaurant it self is still comfy and small. although they could renew the interior a bit. another thing i was a bit disappointed about was the missing of the traditional staff, the cute indonesian waitresses. though the dutch waitress was very cute too in her traditional batik dress. though like to see indonesian faces in an indonesian restaurant. maybe they had a day off haha. i really recommend sari as one of the best indonesian kitchens available in the netherland "
"great indonesian food,  authentic and well established.  in a small space but very cosy.  rice table is their specialty and they know how to do it.  service extremely friendly."
"a great place to order and take out indonesian dinner as we call it rijsttafel. this is one of my dads favorite meals. and at times we go for take out 3x per week. very good service, large quantity of food. great price"
"excellent quality, nice staff, really great choice, in one word...... jummy!!!! had dinner with grandchildren and they loved it."
both the food from takeout and restaurant are of great quality. this is and will probably always be my favorite indonesian restaurant. take away tip: nasi goreng rames speciaal

"the food is fantastic.  this restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  i had a wonderful brunch at the restaurant.  the staff is friendly and professional."
"a creative and playful set of courses (you can choose from 5, 6 or 7) presented in a cozy 8 table, tastefully decorated setting. cautions: they do not accept credit or debit cards! also, for international (non-dutch) travelers, they do not speak english. total cost for a dinner for two (6 courses) with one glass of wine - 80 euros."
"you were so enjoyable today! tender, juicy, cooked to perfection. accompanied by tasty mash, vegetables wrapped in bacon and a salad, you were exactly what i wanted to bite into. and your price was right. thank you (and the cook of course)."
"nice restaurant in the heart of assen. very friendly staff, good food, relatively good prices (for the netherlands)."
"i come to holland to visit my partner, every time i do come here i come to noyas it‚Äôs good and the price is well worth what you spend, it‚Äôs a shame they don‚Äôt deliver to smilde."
"im writing this review while dining because i just have to get it off my chest. this restaurant is  great, the owner is an amazing host and the food is absolutely delicious. good flavours, great menu, good beers."
"in a view words: perfect! the tastes are so good, every bite is an sensation. happy nice owner who took the jump to start in coronatime. he knows what food en drinks are about!  a must go!"
"exactly what we missed in assen, a good tex-mex restaurant! great food, lovely place and friendly service! love the tacos! you gotta try the churros as dessert!  just dreamy! ü§óüç¥"
came here to eat on an extremely busy night. the night before assen tt. service was excellent. lots of waitresses. food came within a reasonable time considering how busy it was. it was well worth the wait. i had a rib eye steak. it was beautiful. would definitely eat here again. would recommend a visit. famous for ribs 
witterbrug has the best food in town. the people are very nice and friendly. we love this place. sparerips and sate are my favorite. best food for a normal price.
"we ate here saturday night. it feels like a typical english pub inside, very cosy. the two men in the group ordered ribs (sweet ones on a recommendation from our server) and they declared them the best ribs they have ever eaten. the two women in the group ordered steak which was perfectly cooked and tasty. the only slight disappointment was the dessert of dame blanche which was served in a glass dish rather than the normal flat plate and didnt have enough chocolate sauce! but other than that the evening was perfect and the young lady serving us was lovely! "
"we go every year when in assen for the world superbikes. some of the best food i have eaten and the people that work there are excellent. good beer, good service and good food all round. thank you for looking after us when we visit."
"we found this restaurant just off the centre of assen a few years ago and visit at least once every time we are in the city. great atmosphere and service, good choice of food (menu available in english) 2 minute walk along the canal in to assen and reasonable pr "
"the best indian restaurant ive been. excellent taste!!!!! when order in you get chips, union-saus and chips extra."
when we go out we mostly choose indian restaurants. we visited new delhi in assen for the first time and it was an excellent experience with tasty food and generous portions.
"we enjoyed a meal at new delhi on may 10. the friendly host/waiter made us feel very welcome. we ordered some favorites and were surprised by the size of the portions. the food was fantastic, fresh and served with a smile, though we couldn‚Äôt eat all of it. the prices were lower than we expected also. we would dfinitely recommend this restaurant."
"it is a nice, family restaurant. nicely decorated and with a good atmosphere. very cosy. the restaurant offers a big menu, a lot of choises! great tasting food for a resonable price. a perfect place for an evening out or take away."
ate here on the eve of assen motogp so not unsurprisingly were the menus targeted at set rather than a la carte which were reasonably expensive.  tasty dishes however and prompt service unlike another restaurant we walked out of.
"really nice indian restaurant. staff were very helpful and polite. food was excellent, tasty and warm."
"went there with a few friends. the chicken vindaloo tasted like heaven. the peswari nan was ok. very friendly staff member asked if the dish wasnt to spicy which, for me, was right on the spot. will definitely come again."
"small place with a typical atmosphere. very friendly staff, but best of all, great indian food. and for a decent price! much better than most indian restaurants which adept roo much to local taste."
very nice restaurant! very good quality of food and decent service. very recommended for a nice indian meal!
"delicious indian food. small restaurant, very good service. the restaurant is located near the drents museum and the brink in assen, the oldest piece of this town."
"been to this place many times over the past couple of years and love it. food is great, service is friendly and the price is right. having compared this place to british indian restaurants i feel it is very similar and can definitely compete with the best indian food ive had in the uk. they do take away as well."
this is a very very good adress for indian food.  the staff is helpfull and the food is so good......check it out
"hubby and i have been going to this restaurant since 2008. since weve lived in india (new delhi) for four years before, we were in search for authentic indian food when we arrived in assen. this restaurant did not disappoint! we love the food and the owner is a really great guy who loves to chat each time he sees his regular patron "
"nice indian restaurant in pleasant location in assen, opposite the italian ice cream restaurant (probably the bet dessert option ;-). the food at new dehli is straight indian food as you know it from british indian restaurants, good quality, very reasonable prices. love their garlic nan but also the chicken tandoori is very good. recommended."
"the restaurant serves high quality food and drinks. the staff is friendly and professional. if you one is not interested in a full meal, one can always order snacks and drinks. the restaurant terrace is also a wonderful place to sit and enjoy a meal and drinks. "
good accommodation and friendly staff. good food in restaurant; only problem is having to park some distance away from hotel.
"staff first class. rooms very comfortable, large and very quiet. the room we were in seemed to be a newly refurbished"
myself and a group of friends stopped here to eat as they have a very nice terrace where you can sit and watch the world go by. as it was motogp weekend the restaurant was very busy but the service was very good and the staff were friendly. food was reasonably priced and very good. we did end up visiting again before the weekend ended.
"nice hotel in centre of assen. clean, bright and the staff are friendly. food before 9 am can be an issue as all the local establishments does not open till 9am"
"we chose this hotel restaurant as our first in the netherlands because we wanted to use a credit card and it is one of the few in the town that accepts them. it is located on a busy square in the town center and is a wonderful place to pass as much time as you please enjoying the passing parade of bicyclists and pedestrians on their daily errands. no cars are allowed in the center of this charming town. there are many outdoor tables with umbrellas as well as a glassed-in area at the front of the establishment. because it was a chilly october day we chose to sit inside under a roof section of skylights, surrounded by windows looking out onto the square. it is quiet and the wait staff is excellent. on our first visit we ordered from the less expensive lunch men "
a very busy lunchroom in the middle of assen they serve typical lunch time food sandwiches and soups service was good as the place is very large and busy has a nice heated terrace!!
"service is nice, there¬¥s a lot of place to sit (in- and outside) and the food tasted nice (i had a hawaii bread)"
"great coffee, amazing apple cake, homemade tasty crunchy and fresh, great choice of teas, gift packages"
nice little coffee and chocolate shop with great tasting treats. the interior decoration gives the place a warm and  welcoming atmosphere. would revisit!
the terrace we sat on was cosy. i had a brownie and ice tea and it tasted good. the service was well. nothing to complain.
"i absolutely loved it so much here, i had a hot chocolate which was amazing, there was the choice of milk, dark and white chocolate. it had such a nice atmosphere and there was a huge range of teas and coffee. i also had a cup of tea because i didnt want to leave !! i ventured upstairs and found a more isolated area that would be great also, i am in assen for another month and i am sure that i will be spending a lot more time at coffee & tasty. "
"great coffee, nice ambiance and good terrace in spring/summer. friendly staff and a good selection of coffee and tea (also to purchase for use at home)"
they have very good coffee beans from different places. you can choose one to have an espresso and buy some to take home. very nice place!
"the coffee & tasty in assen is a combined coffee and lunch cafe, with a shop to buy premium coffee and tea. they have seating downstairs in the shop but many visitors venture upstairs where you can sit more privately. they also have outdoor seating in summer. the decor in the shop is a nice mix of modern and classic. prices are quite reasonable with many lunch dishes around 6 eur "
we had a great meal to take away from the balkan restaurant. fresh meat from the grill and luxurious portions. it could use a bit more vegetables though.
"friendly staff members and generous portions of food. we had the seckani biftek	and the balkan plat. the meat was cooked well, very tasty. good place for meat lovers."
"for me, who likes balkan cuisine this place became a unexpected finding! they cook almost the same dishes as you can find in me beloved croatia"
"we went to celebrate a birthday, and ordered the sabel dish. tons of meat, all very well prepared. side dishes were nice and fresh. great experience. we will certainly go back here."
"small chinese restaurant with really kind and perfect service. very tasty and good prices.  ordered a litle starter and a really great one for only 6.90 euro. main menu:  unbeliveable great taste, great portion. great great great. absolutely to be recommended."
visited happy gardens last weekend with 5 friends. we had a lovely meal and the staff were excellent. bit of the beaten track. if youre staying at dr binge weber hotel its only 10 minutes walk.
"i ate here on a quiet thursday night in march. the restaurant had only one other family dining but that didnt impact on us at all. the service we received from our young waitress was fantastic and the food is definitely the best chinese ive eaten in assen and probably the whole of holland. chinese in holland is different to what we have in the uk (generally a lot better in the uk) but we managed to order dishes that were tasty, fresh and full of flavour. my mum said the pancake roll (loempia) was the best shed ever eaten and the spicy sweet and sour chicken was delicious. i definitely will be returning. "
we went here for a meal when at the superbikes. the restaurant was empty when we got to it at 8.30 pm. the young waitress couldnt speak english and our dutch was nil. however we were offered and banquet of different dishes to which we accepted. it was all very nice and tasty. pudding i bit poor in choice. drinks as usual price 
"good service, great food, and decor that turns chinese restaurant decor on its head. make a beeline for this place, you wont regret it."
"little price, wonderful foods, very nice people ! dont hesitate !! by french people came for assen tt"
never been to this restaurant before and we arrived when the heavens had opened and we had to dash to stay dry.  service is a little slow but the menu appealed to us.  not pretentious but good food.  we will certainly be back here.
visited here with husband and 2 children while staying in ass 
had a pancake here of an evening. boat is quaint and large. staff friendly and service was quick. pancake with mushrooms onion and bacon was delicious - the beacon was very tasty and lots of it. only down side - no tap water only bottled which is charged for.
amazing place with a great ambiance. very nice that your eating in an actual ship what is completely rebuild in to a restaurant. we were very impressed with how the ship looked like and the location. the quality of the pancakes are as far as our experience goes above standard made from biological and quality ingredients. this place has an child friendly environment because from the moment you enter until you leave the wait staff is taking excellent care of the children. really a place to recommend when you visit assen or even word too take a little detour before you go somewhere else.
very good food. very nice people who serve you. you order wine and without asking you also get a glas of water! for children its perfect there! everyone is helpfull !
really good atmosphere in the boat. the staff is nice and the choice is great. i took a banana pancake with cinnamon and sugar. its a really thick pancake and worth the money. enjoyable for lunch or dinner.
it is a good place with great range of pancakes. we try both salty and sweet one. nothing can beat its apple cinnamon pancake.
"the restaurant caf√© is located in the centre of diever next to the ancient church, at the brink (center of the village). we had bife tartare, smokes forel pat√© and mustard soup as first dishes. very tasteful and large portions. as a main dish we have chosen drents weide rund prime steak (2) and ratatouille with brie cheese. all dishes were tasteful, the staff very friendly and nice good cold draft weizenbeer. all in all a remarkable location and wonderful food. highly recommendable"
the food and the drinks tasted fanatastic! very nice staff helped us and provided information regarding the menu. really a beautifull view over the fields next to the restaurant.
"visited the restaurant for the christmas dinner special. the grazing table was absolutely terrific with a bounty of finnish bites, the pickled herring was to die for. from the warm atmosphere to the polite and multi lingual staff, one of the best places to spend an evening enjoying some fine high cuisine."
"vegan food at nordic restaurant. this unique combination is possible here. the food was tasty and well seasoned.  situated near forest reserve, lovely place and interior"
wonderful food and atmosphere!! we will surely be back!  it really seems that all the staff are really taking care of the customers!
"we were here during lockdown at a time where we were only allowed to have dinner in our room. dinner was truly wonderful, surprising combinations, lovingly prepared and served with great attention to hospitality. the owners are very friendly and understand how to pamper their guests. and i fell in love with their dog ;-)"
"few mistakes were made during our surprise dinner here, and we enjoyed each meal and accompanying wine. the staff is very friendly and eager to please, and the chef has created some original and very tasty dishes. if we had to critique something, it would be that one of us had salmon as first √°nd main course: a different fish would have been more interesting but then again, both dishes were fantastic. this is fine dining and not cheap, but worth it if you want to spend on a special evening and good food and wines."
"we, our whole 2+2 family, had a pleasure to visit blauwhemel right after new year eve hassle and just before they went for winter break. it is difficult to describe the feeling when you don‚Äôt expect much, but receive a whole l "
"me and my girlfriend came here on a saturday evening, we were instantly made to feel welcome with great service and great smiles from all the staff. we waited no longer than 10 minutes for our table to be ready which gave use a nice amount of time to enjoy one of there cocktails that were also very enjoyab "
"great welcome with warm hands and lots of enthusiasm! great atmosphere and good for for family of business. good music in the background and spacious table setting and delicious and well balanced dishes. experience enthusiastic service, ambiance and excellent food! enjoy!!"
"great place for a lunch after a biking tour. fresh and tasty sandwiches, nice and attentive owners and beautiful view. inside area looks fantastic as well. worth a visit"
"about 16.00 hrs we landed on the terrace in the center of beautiful diever, a place where quite some traffic is passing but meanwhile a cosy place to be 4/5. there were some more people, the terrace was almost occupied. we ordered a tea, hot chocolate with cream, mushroom soup and apple pie with cream 4/5. the service was friendly and the waiting time short, about 6 minutes 5/5. refreshed we continued our journey 4/5."
we were very friendly helped by our waitress to find a table in a very busy restaurant. the choice of beer and wine was very good and the service was excellent. always somebody available to take your order and it was delivered very quickly. the only negative was the naco‚Äôs which were burnt but our waitress sorted it out. the other food we saw serverd was well receiv 
"very good atmosphere. lots of different beers to choose from. highly preferred by the locals. terrasse, conservatory, and cafe/restaurant. good food at reasonable prices. once experienced, you understand why it is so popular."
enjoyed mustard soup which included buns on the side. also some iced cappuccinos on the side. price was very reasonable.
"centrally located among great shopping and parks with a large patio. i recommend the brasserie salad with goat cheese...i went back the next day for a second time just to have it!! the service is a bit slow, but they do have a english menu. the wait staff do their best to speak english for you as well. i absolutely loved sitting outside and watching the people and bikes pass by. "
"if youre in the neighbourhood of emmen, go here for your evening mea "
"good food, nice atmosphere. most notable was the staff: friendly, fast, knowledgeable. we also found the restaurant family friendly and having good vegetarian options available (same quality as the meat dishes). some reviews here mention the big portions, we found them large as well but not impossibly big. the fact you get good quality food in decently size prorations scored points with us. in short: worth a visit if you are staying in the area!"
"cosy amenity, steak done right, side dishes could be better. overall a good choice and we had a lovely dinner."
friendly service and reasonable pricing. i‚Äôve ordered the salted caramel brownie which was decent and an espresso.
"well, the headline says it all, doesnt it. this is a place that you just have to visit a few times to really see how original and good the food is. not only is it very tasteful, but the presentation and mix of flavors is always of a very high standard. it is hard to keep that level of quality in your restaurant over and over again. to come up with new and exiting ideas about your dish of the month ( this month its a pulled pork sandwich to die for ! ) everything is fresh, service very good and welcoming. and you can see that they are all very proud of their restauran "
this is a fantastic restaurant - which ticks all the boxes - great service; amazing food; great ambience. i have eaten many curries in my life but none beat the indian food i‚Äôve eaten here. i highly recommend this restaurant.
"we eat here nearly every week, or do take out during covid lockdowns. the interior is outdated and in desperate need of modernization, and the service can be slow. but... the food makes it all worth it. real authentic food, with intense flavours. fave dishes are the shabi kurma and chicken madras. the owners are incredibly kind, and another reason we keep coming ba "
"this is a real indian restaurant (i guess bangladeshi), not the usual indo-china establishment you mostly find in the netherlands. food is excellent with a large choice on the menu. forget the wines as none worthy is available but indian beer is available."
if you like indian food this is the only place in emmen to go. the food is good but nothing special. the service is ok as well.
"great food, super friendly, humble, young staff. good atmosphere, good prices, will visit again soon."
"we were pleasantly surprised with this indian restaurant. after all, emmen is not too exotic a town. for those not tamiliar with the indian sub-continent kitchen, the menu states clearly what to expect: mild, hot and very hot. we liked it so much that we went back twice in quick succession. on both occasions, we were not disappointed. they cook authentically here as one would expect in a bangladeshi run establishment. for those who like alcohol with their meal, there is a good selection, including kingfisher beer brewed in indi "
for a modest price you can enjoy a delicious diner here. the menu gives you lots of choice. decoration is basic and the service is ok.
"for me and my girlfriend it was the first time at an indian restaurant. the atmosphere is cosy and the staff is nice. because of our first experience, it had been hard for us to decide which dish to take. we decided for chicken meal matched with rice and bread; i was satisfied and full! at the end i can say that the restaurant is also relatively cheap."
we gave this indian restaurant a chance to prove itsel 
the currys are great and the staf friendly. we enjoyed the nanbread fresh made out of the oven. the lam tasted very smooth. enjoy!! o yes for the dutch people good  prices!
"please.. watch your fingers, as the food is just beautifu "
"wow! what a lovely restaurant, we realised this was a great place to eat when we walked through the door and it was full of local people. interior of restaurant was lovely and the staff were absolutely fantastic . food was amazing and plenty of it. not the cheapest but happy to pay a little extra for quality and lovely surroundings,would certainly visit again if in that area again"
"coming from denmark, we amed to eat here, as we had good memories from years a "
"just as simple as that. best chinesse food in emmen. i recomend the cantonesse menu for 2, we couldnt finish it and was really tasty."
"i live in china for more than 3 years already,... so i clearly did not go to this restaurant for the chinese food. i feel the chinese food is not authentic. however i do really like the indonesian food. take away is fast and the portions are gigantic! if in emmen,... this is a good place to eat! the pick-up is closed for lunch,... that is a pitty!"
"had a takeaway meal last month for my staff. as with all chinese foods you always get more then you can eat, and the taste of most of the dishes were grea "
"friendly restaurant, good food and a great place to eat with friends. nice surroundings with no complaints from us at all .... except the awful background music! mind you, when we mentioned this to the waiter, it did make him laugh. menu in dutch (of course), but waiter very kindly helped us choose our food as our dutch is limited to hello and bye bye! will definitely go back again for more good food in the future. well worth a visit if you are in the area."
"altough it was the high season bussy and very warm, the food was tasty and service excelent. the outside sitting area is also a nice place to sit."
we enjoyed our lunch with a group of 10 in the restaurant part of t knooppunt. service was fairly quick and the food was prepared under our eyes in the open kitchen. coffee and tea as well as the lunch dishes were of good quality and also good value for money. the airy restaurant room was attractively decorated and properly heated as well. the only remark could be that we were not asked if we wanted drinks with the lunch dish 
"we were going to lelystad haven and on the way we always eat something at this d√©lifrance. the waiters are friendly. the food is good, sometimes a little bit much but thats ok√©."
"tasty food, good choice. good value for money. high chairs for kids. hope there will be more vegetarian options in future."
"our family of 3 adults and 2 kids had lunch at la place restaurant when we visited batavia stad fashion outlet on 23rd april 2019. there is adequate parking. the restaurant had a large dining area. there was a wide choice of meals - soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza, stir-fry meals, juices, tea/coffee as well as desserts on a self-service basis. the meals were healthy and wholesome. although the meals cost an average of about 18 euros per person, all of us had a satisfying meal."
"we were pleasantly surprised to find a la place in the factory outlets of batavia stad. they are upstairs, next to a small playground and queue-free entrance to bataviawerf (with its replica voc sail ship "
ideal restaurant for a quick lunch in between shopping good selections of hot and cold food and drinks!!
la place offers a good lunch with sizeable portions of fairly healthy components. did not see any deep fried stuff. it is a large place on the second floor of the outlet mall above a number of shops. good views over the mall and the very impressive replica batavia ship outdoor in the harbour. better be early like 11:45 because it gets busy.
"when i had time to relax after quite a bit of shopping, i decided to come to this place and glad that i did.. iÃá had one of the best pizzas ever and the prices are very reasonable too.. they have all kinds of foods here, great place.."
"so we were hungry went up the stairs to see what la place is all about perfect, self service, fresh food great food eatery we had a sandwich, apple pie and a beer (or two)"
"very pleasant, open, flooded with light coming through the large windows. in this way the march√© like restaurant offers fresh food, including smoothies, salads and fresh soups. although it remains a self-service model, its a good choice."
we enjoyed a very delicious indian dinner. the host is extremely attentive and very kind. the food was very tasty and we loved our evening. very recommandable and reasonable prices.
visited here with friends. we had a lovely mix of starters to be shared among us and then main courses for each of us. everything tasted good and we definitely had enough to eat. naan with garlic was great choic 
"fantastic restaurant, good food and good ambiance, friendly staff. pls try jhinga tandoori, in my view one of the best. truly indian cuisine."
1st time we visited this restaurant in lelystad. it certainly was a pleasant experien 
nice place to dine. good and tasty indian food. easy to reach and a very clean place. pleasant background indian music. lots of choices in the menu. clean toilet. fast and friendley service.
"great local indian restaurant. friendly and attentive service, very tasty dishes. i hope that town residents support this very well run gem. highly recommended."
"highly recommended ! as first time customers we ordered two main dishes (chicken tikka and garlic chicken kebab), with average expectations. the food was very well prepared and fresh. it was not overdone as well. there was not too much focus on spices or gravy, just spot on. the portion sizes are fine, but due to the taste my wife and i had difficulties to keep away from taking more than needed! the extra that came with the food, aloo mutter, was surprisingly well prepared and would qualify for a full main dish. this gave me the incentive to add this 5th star to this wonderful establishment. keep up the good work!"
"we went there, knowing that in the netherlands food is generally a little toned down. had the dinner for two with spinach, lamb, tandoori mixed, basmati rice and lovely milkrice dessert. very nice and prompt service. food was delicious! we sat outside in the shade. totally enjoyed it and will go again."
"very welcoming, especially as we know, no dutch.  we both had a coffee. the restaurants customers all see to be enjoying themselves in a hushed kind of way."
the menu was clear and contained all the items applicable for lunch. the food was excellent. the service was very friendly and efficient. the atmosphere was pleasant. the decoration was cosy.
"harrels is in my top-3 of favorite places to go to when im in lelystad, because the ambiance is very cosy and the choice of foods and drinks is excellent. they do have flevosap, which is organic apple juice, and other organic foods."
excellent choice to dine to close down the busy workingweek. every friday night a special dish of the day. it comes with french fries and always a very tastfull mixed salad dish. the staff is very hospitable and pays well attention to all guests.
always happy with the food at de cantine and the staff is friendly and makes you feel at home. for me this is my number 1 restaurant in lelystad.
second time weve been here. first time was about a year a 
"we live in france, a country which prides itself on its cuisine, a claim weve found to be - at best - overblown. certainly it is possible to eat extremely well there, but only at a cost. in the netherlands by contrast we found the restaurants to be generally superior in many respects, and this restaurant is a fine example. the service is fast, the staff attentive, and friendly. the food is beautifully cooked (the steaks are spectacular), clearly the ingredients are sourced and selected with care and attention. the location and ambiance lovely, and the final bill much less eye-watering than its french equivalent would be. whats not to like? we love it and go there every visit"
well actually rebuilt from the 1950‚Äôs original (that had to be demolished in 2008) and brought up to date to comply with modern building and health and safety regulations. the original frames have been reused and ‚Äì based on the original drawings - the new building is as close to the original as possible. we walked in without reservation and there was no difficulty even for a saturday night. the food was typical dutch cuisine and very enjoyable. we did not go mad for drinks or starters but enjoyed good quality main courses. my wife sampled the slip tongue (sole) and i choose the spare ribs. certainly recommended and we may well visit again because this was good value food well served and very much enjoyed.
"pulled in for a break and light lunch on my own. this is what i guess we would consider a motorway service station, but it doesnt really feel like it. restaurant is pleasant and comfortable, staff very friendly and helpful (english seemed to be understood and at least one of the staff was fluent). menu provided with all options in engli "
we have stopped here several times as part of our trip through holland it‚Äôs really nice place with very good menu and food. i would really recommend the soups staff are lovely as well.  paul
love the dutch weed burger here. best vegan burger there is. good place for a break and have a lunch or drink.
a really nice restaurant. a.very peaceful and classy look. the red velvet cake was really amazing. the staff is friendly and helpful. a nice place to stop for a break.
this is a comfortable place to stop on the way. the staff is very friendly and the food tasty. you wont notice you are right by the highway.
"the second time we stopped by for quick lunch. tortilla chicken with cheese was pretty good, simple, warm and delicious."
they have take away and also restaurant. food was healthy and good size portions. also cater for children with a good choice.
"for decades already this is my favorite place to stop over, on my way to the northern part of the country, coming from the more urban southwest of the netherlands. you know that you will always get a nice meal here, with friendly staff and good service. try the chicken sateh, a classic..."
stop over restaurant en route giethoorn... good place to buy a hot chocolate or a coffee and to use the rest rooms next door. polite staff. make sure you have a credit card - cash is not accepted.

"we went to lemonakis last week. we had fun! listen to what happened to us. we were a group of four. we arrived at around 7:00 pm. after being seated, we received a welcome drink. that was awesome! we then ordered. fifteen minutes later, the group that had sat right next to our table left. some of these guests hadnt even tried their food. simon told me to take the french fries. i took them. the people at the table behind ours laughed. the fries were good. i went back to the table and took more, i also took another of their dishes. the waitress arrived. she saw that they hadnt eaten much at that table. she apologized for the delay at our table and at the table behind us. she asked if we wanted more of their dinner. we agreed. she also asked to the other table, the one behind us, if they wanted one of the untouched plates. they agreed! we laughed. such an awesome mome "
"i go there regularly with my family for a delicious greek dinner. the food is delicious, typical greek cuisine, big portions, excellent presentation, a complete variety, nice & fast service in a typical greek style decorated place."
"first time placed order at asami sushi. very fast delivery, good price/quality, tasty sushi. will definitely order again."
this place is great. generous portions of excellent fresh sushi. the take away delivery service is friendly and fast. we are regular ordering from here and have not had one bad experience!
we eat here very often. we also order by home delivery. the owner-chef prepares the sushi and the other items fresh after receiving the order. no frozen food and the quality is comparable with any luxury sushi restaurant elsewhere. the delivery is always on time.
"their sushis are nice and fresh. a bit too european style maybe (with mayonnaise,...) but very good anyway. good place to go if you want a take away and have dinner in front of the lake :-)"
"small restaurant where you can eat or order home, fresh and tasty sushi in reasonable price. not in center, but they do home delivery."
"we had a steak and a meatball for lunch. the steak was tender, the meatball was juicy and spicy. we both loved it. the staff is really friendly and attentive."
waiting time: satisfied service: loved it food: stunning (best burger)  overall: it‚Äôs a must-go restaurant. everything was fantastic!
"we visited het broodhuys in leeuwarden recently. the food was good . i ordered a rare steak which arrived more medium than rare, however , it was tender and delicious. the staff were helpful and efficient and i would return."
the restaurant was very busy we ordered and it arrived very quickly. my husband and i both had the burgers they were well cooked and the chips were nicely cooked and crunchy. the burger came with a delicious sauce served separately along with mayonnaise for the chips. this resturant is a smooth running and well organised resturant . pleasant staff and would definatly eat there again.
"my first visit to this place and looking for a small lunch , i love croquettes so the decision was easy , in dutch style with a slice of bread too, lovely service and nowadays so easy to pay just swipe and pay using your credit card , i remember the old days and that is not long ago that credit cards were not accepted anywhere , well thats history "
"very good food, nice breeze, wifi and nice birds. i named one of the birds wayne rooney. over all, very nice place :)"
"stumbled on this while looking for somewhere for breakfast on a cold and deserted sunday morning. most places are closed on a sunday, so we were grateful to see this welcoming and warm place nearby. very cosy interior, fantastic coffee and the best bagels ver. add to this fantastic service and this is the place to go for breakfast."
"had a soy milk latte and vegan bagel, was lovely! sat in the sun and had a wonderful time here. would visit again"
the atmosphere was good and perfect for a late lun 
"friendly staff but you got to be lucky to get a place as it is quite tiny, cosy and always busy. interesting bagel menu, everything delicious and the coffee is just amazing and i am quite picky when it comes to coffee"
"a really good option for having your favorite bagels! the products are fresh and tasty! the service is very friendly and fast! at that day we had life music, so it was a really enjoyable breakfast with a wonderful atmosphere! thumbs  "
think relaxed classical music combined with great coffee and fresh food! the setting is cute and just minutes from the heart of the city and canals. a perfect start to the day.
coffee is great and the girls who work here are very helpful.  one of the best cappuccinos i had on my visit to leeuwarden!
nice relaxed place to eat.  have tried several of their bagels - all delicious. love their mint tea with honey.  coffee is served in delightful unusual cups.  no pressure to leave.
"nicely located on one of leeuwardens canals in the city center, it is lovely to sit both inside or outside on the cale. the inside is quite alternative, but very cosy, and we spent many hours there with friends- either just for a good coffee, a fresh juice or lunch/breakfast with some bagels."
"sooo if you ever see bagels and beans just go inside, sit on a table and just open the menu! its difficult to decide between all these types of bread and the flavors but all of them they are delicious! the prices are a little bit expensive but still its worth it!! take your friends and go there.......!!!"
we stopped into bagels & beans because it looked interesting and we were just trying to find some breakfast. this little place was really excellent for coffee and healthy snacks. we had a bagel treat and a yogurt dish. the food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly and fun.
what a pleasant surprise this cafe ! it is a shame i did discover it only on the last day of my trip . i sure will be back on my next trip to leeuwarden . thanks for everything !!!
"this was the first caf√© i was on when i came to the netherlands. after that i always come back to it. they have excellent food, smoothies are delicious and fresh, and it is possible to get hot chocolate with soy milk (which i appreciate, that is lactose intolerant)."
"we like to have the slow-breakfast deal in the morning, its always a nice treat (and more or less healthy). all the combinations with bagels are delicious, and made with fresh ingredients. we also love the smoothies, but especially the coffee! caff√® delizioso ;)"
everytime we have so much fun at beagels and beans !!! :) ;) the food offered there is great !!! the staff is really polite and easygoing !!!
on my search for the best coffee in leeuwarden - this place has been the best so far. dobbel cappucino :)
"bagels and beans is a dutch bagel-restaurant chain which is famous for its relaxing interior and great bagles. you can choose form a variety of bagles and add your own ingredients if you feel creative. moreover, there is a wide choice of juices which are all delicious. bagels can be eaten at the restaurant itself or ordered to go. a perfect place to meet friends, stop by during a busy shopping day or have lunch when in town. although its based on a fast-food-restaurant concept, you might have to wait a while before youre served your order."
"we stumbled across this place by accident and were absolutely delighted that we found it.  despite the simple interior, the food was freshly cooked and delicious. we were made to feel very welcome. would definitely return if ever back in leeuwarden."
"i was there 3 times and each time was a great experience- the service, home-like atmosphere, and of course the food. as a vegetarian you have a choice between 7-8 delicious dishes. i like the feeling how through ethiopian food you understand the culture a little bit better. as an improvement i would like the drink menu to be wider and contain organic tea/ coffee collection."
just love these special places that make you feel like you‚Äôre in another worl 
this is a no frills ethiopian enclave in the city center of exotic leeuwarden. i had the vegetarian injera but theres also meat on the menu. the owner/cook is a lovely lady. just check it out!
"really friendly staff and great food. we went with teenagers and a 7 year old. we requested the food wasn‚Äôt too spicy and we got exactly what we wanted - very tasty, not too spicy food and lots of variety (we opted for the tasting menu). the service was helpful, talking is through our options and packing up our left overs when we couldn‚Äôt finish it al "
"everything for me was good. the waiting time to receive my order was ok, not short and not long. the delivery male was friendly and has good attitudes. both food and drink were better than i expected. i ordered the ikan pepes medium menu. the white rice portion was perfectly enough for me. but the fish was so big so i left it for my next meal. althought i am a person who eat a lot. and the vegetable also was much but it‚Äôs a good thin "

it makes sense to start with mentioning i lived in indonesia and have a fabulous meal in atambua as a reference. a couple all the way from sumatra went to timor to cook padang foo 
"i visit ondel ondel regularly because the food is always prepared and served perfectly. the service is always very friendly. ive tried indonesian dishes for many times in asia, but the quality at ondel ondel is great. my friend and i recommend you soto ayam. also gado gado and (for those who are keen on spicy food) daging rendang is a recommendation."
"we are new in leeuwarden and like asian food, so we tried this little cosy indonesian restaurant. the staff is very friendly and offered us a table on the firstfloor or on the groundfloor. we chosed the ground floor. we ordered nassi goreng, telor cocos, rendang, spicy beans, daging smoor, chicken sate, fried tofu, spicy chicken etc. the chicken sate was good but the peanut sauce wasnt the authentic indonesian peanut sauce. the taste is authentic but the flavour could be more specific. the dishes were spicy as ususal for many indonesian dishes. we enjoyed our dinner but as said, the flavours could be better. we are a couple, malaysian/dutch with much food experience in the far east."
"wide range of offers, lovely staff. can be a place for lunch, dinner or take away. besides they have interesting snacks worth trying"
"lovely, friendly little place off the high street/shopping area of leeuwarden which we stumbled upon quite by accident. having eaten in some of the best indonesian places in amsterdam and london, this little gem is unpretentious and in my opinion (and my daughter who‚Äôs never eaten indonesian fare before) .. ‚Äòthe best food i‚Äôve ever tasted‚Äô. the beef rendang is fragrant and tender. best of all the food is authentic and honest and has not been altered to suit local taste. generous portions, reasonably priced. we couldn‚Äôt read the menu (was in dutch mostly) so went with what was recommended by staff - which was brilliant! highly recommended!"
we went here on the recommendation of our indonesian friends. they told us that if we wanted realy indonesian food we should visit ondel ondel indonesia in leeuwarden and oh boy did it taste good. the food is exactly like in indonesia and i wouldnt want it any other way.
"amazing food, very friendly staff (owner), we had very good lunch with plenty of food en vegan options, you should try it out"
"we like to mix it up and go looking for something that is not peoples first choice, like this korean restaurant. it was quiet (one gentleman) but the food was excellent. kimbap was really good, japchae with bulgogi also. try the korean beer when you are the "
"good food, spicy and healthy! we enjoyed our korean meal here. less busy than the main tourist areas."
we spent ages trying to find a cheap restaurant that had some gluten-free food. the staff spoke brilliant english and offered to adjust some of the dishes to give us more options. amazing food and incredible staff!
"happened upon this hidden little gem of a restaurant while walking downtown with a friend and decided to give it a try. small card, always a good sign of a restaurant owner knowing her business. great tasting dishes and friendly servide. on the way out, i decided to purchase the home made kimchi which is light, fresh and gingerly!"
"decided to finally try stek with my friends. besides the little embarrassing entry moment (we entered through the glass door instead of the regular one) everything was delightful. very nice stuff provided us with a menu containing quite a few options. i personally has a cappuccino and a muffin (and the muffin was delicious, especially for those with a sweet tooth üòâ) the place is very aesthetically decorated and conveniently located near the city center. all the products seemed fresh als "
"i had a delicious ginger tea, banana bread and fries. the house cat is very friendly and likes to be petted. all in all a nice stay."
i did not expect this place to be such a w 
we passed this restaurant when we were visiting the center of leeuwarden. this place is close to the bridges and the canals somewhat west of the city center. its a busy area with lots of traffic but they still offered some nice seating both inside and outside. when seated inside you can look into the kitchen and its clear that this place is run by a female-only staff. they also are only open from thursday to sunday for dinner. the other days they close at 6 p.m. they also have an open counter on the street side for take away. their menu is not very extravagant but they serve honest food and it is clear than youngsters feel at home here. the wines were not very chilled but that was quickly solved with some complimentary ice cubes and the food was quite ok. the prices are really modest here which adds to the attractiveness for the youth of leeuwarden. but we also felt at home here and this place deserves a higher ranking on the list for this nice city.
"a favourite spot of mine in leeuwarden.   the location is fantastic.  the service attentive, food is ok but the surroundings make up for it and the price reflects it.   perfect for a lazy brunch."
"the all you can eat menu has a variety of appetizers, sashimi, rolls, and rice dishes. there‚Äôs a dessert bar with a variety of ice crea "
"we just had dinner at nihon88. what can i say? excellent, delicious, worth every cent. five rounds to order per person for ‚Ç¨25 each. we were rolling in super sushi, tried soup, ramen, bacon - actually we couldnt eat as much as we could hav "
you choose  between  a lot of small  dishes  with all kind of very delicious courts. very nice staff. we will for sure come back.
"this is one of my favorites in leeuwarden. i am from america but i live here now and one thing i was sure to be giving up was mexican food, but no! yucat√°n is amazing and makes me feel right at home again when i need a mexican food moment. everything is delicious, the staff is always friendly. i‚Äôve never had a bad moment her "
"our bike group descended onto yucatan to celebrate the accomplishment of our frisian 11 cities bike tour - no accidents, no breakdowns, no arguments, et "
"for an uncomplicated, relatively affordable meal yucatan could be a good choice. had the yucatan mix and i loved it. washed down with a few mexican beers i had a ball. uncomplicated and tasty,  recommended"
"after what took my friends and i about 2 hours to choose a prefect place for dinning, we decided on trying out yucatan. little did we know this place would come to blow our minds with their amazing food and beverage... we ordered the rib eye and 4 different sides and of course a nice frozen margarita.. the meat was succulently juicy and the drinks on point. let me not forget to mention the amazingly great service of the kind staff. compliments to the chef and you will be seeing more of me.. "
"ive been here with some friends, the restaurant is located in the city centre, so it is easy to come here. the atmosphere is really nice, the staff is kind and they have also english and german menus and they speak englis "
"it was very busy in this restaurant and as we got seated, i was surprised that it was a big restaurant. service was excellent and our waitress spoke english as was the menu card. we ordered nachos for a starter, lovely and cheesy! then we ordered quesadillas and onion soup which was all very tasty! we finished our meal with lemon cheesecake, vanilla ice cream and what a way to finish off for the evening. my husband left behind his glasses and we were are about 150 metres up the road and our waitress flagged us down to return his glasses. service above and beyond. "
"being from the western usa, i was craving some mexican in a foreign land. very pleasantly surprised to find good mexican in the nl. had several good regional beers, nachos and a burrito. all very very good. staff was friendly, menu was in english and i was very satisfied. its not the same as in the american southwest, but pretty damn good!!"
my wife and i have been coming here for many years and have consistently had edible happiness every time. especially the nachos todos and burrito picada mixta are spectacular.
"we have been to this restaurant multiple times and will keeo going back. the food is delicious. i lived in los angeles and had been missing good mexican food since my move to friesland but yucatan goes above and beyond my expectations every time. the food is delicious, the people are friendly, the restaurant can feel a bit crowded at times but it actually adds to the atmosphere rather than takes it away. my favorite thing to get: their burrito mixta. half chicken half meat burrito, best of both worlds. "
"our group ate twice in the yucatan restaurant during a two-week stay in a leeuwarden. on both occasions, extensive menu with great food, large portions and efficient friendly service. it is a popular place to have dinner, and not being the largest restaurant in leeuwarden, booking is recommended. would definitely eat here again."
big portions for a nice price. the waiters were quick and welcoming and the locale was cozy and family friendly. the have some really nice tequila! would go again.
"very good mexican food, it was very busy, but the service was good just the same. the menu is extensive, and you are sure to find something you like!"
food was good but the service was rather slow.  cuisine is cooked correctly and theres plenty of spices. i would eat here again.
if you ever had real mexican food than this is so so. 
as we were in the neighbourhood and felt like mexican we decided to give this restaurant a try. the staff was friendly although later on the evening it got quite busy and then they stressed out a little (just the body language not how they communicate with customers - that was still well enough 
"i‚Äôve been here on a saturday with my girlfriend. the entrance was quite strange, with a big curtain at the door. personnel were really friendly and made us feel comfortable. the restaurant is not too big, i think it‚Äôs for 30 people or something like that (there were stairs going upstairs, maybe there are more tables "
good deliciuos food and nice people. nice sitedish  very busy with al lot of other customers who also were eating and enjoying.
"lovely food and very friendly staff. would recommend this place to others! in the city center, go and find out!"
"great food, definitely recommend! i went with my boys, 5yo and 8yo, during a 4 day stay in leeuwarden. staff is very friendly, food is good quality. the kids can play in the speelhoek. both nights only about 20 mins waiting time. we will return for sure! "
"i was together with my man an daughter. we have had a very pleasant evening. the food was good but it took a while before we got it. there is a nice little space for younger children to play, very pleasant. the staff was also very hospitable"
"we had a pleasant dinner there a couple of nights ago. the staff was extremely welcoming and helpful. the food was, as expected, tasteful and beautifully plated. the waiting time was the only thing that didnt stand well with me. it is a pretty big restaurant so it makes sense, however, the food took longer than expected to come which was not ideal."
amazing service with friendly staff and amazing desserts. the food was satisfactory and absolutely filling out to the belly!  would come again!
"good food! servants are very kind but a bit slow, a ‚Äúwait & see‚Äù attitude. no problem for us though :)"
"you can‚Äôt make a better choice then going to eetcafe ‚Äúhet leven‚Äù . nice service friendly and fast. the food is excellent. i had a nice steak tartare, not something you eat everywhere but here you can give it a try!! my wife took the fish trio which was outstanding. the plates not only tasted well but also looked like a picas "
"nicely furnished and decorated restaurant in a former industrial building, good selection of interesting dishes, all perfectly prepared and nicely presented on the plates, all dishes are served with homemade fries and a salad"
cozy atmosphere. good value for money and tasty food. i had the club sandwich. big portion of food and very tasty.
went for dinner with my husband. because of the nice weather we got a table in the garden. personnel was very friendly and provided very good service. the food was excellent!! we will visit again.
"stopped there just because of being hungry. fortunately we got a nice seat outside in the sun and ordered without seeing the menu, just by the waitress recommendation. i got a tasty cheeseburger: fresh and juicy beef. my wife got the vegetarian burger: the best one ive ever go "
"we hadnt tried het leven before, but went on the recommendation of one of our hotel staff members. great recommendation. it has a pretty laid back atmosphere, reminiscent of a country cottage restaurant. its not big, but clearly popular, so dont expect to get a table straight away if you havent booked. we hadnt, but just got lucky! i get some of the poorer reviews, but many seem to be a result of getting a table on a busy evening and expecting immediate gratification. its not that sort of pla "
"apparently a very busy evening, so it took a while before we were seated. however, once we were, friendly service, nice not too long menu, well cooked. and all for a friendly price, so recommended!"
"eetcafe het leven serves delicious food in a cozy environment. it is a large restaurant but with several rooms that are all uniquely decorated. we each had salads for lunch. the salads were large, delicious and healthy and we all left the restaurant very full and satisfied."
very nice people. the food is very good value for money. the atmosphere is layd back en casual. also recommended for families.
"excellent food, with dishes you do not find elsewhere, all at a reasonble price. very kind staff. for childeren there is a play corner."
the food is good ( but dont expect fine dini 
"it started to rain as i was walking around leeuwarden and there was eetcafe het leven. i decide to try it and stepped inside, asking for a table for one for dinner.i was shown to a nice corner table with room for two. the surroundings were charming, casual, and rustic. the service staff was charmingly friendly, service-minded, and professional. they made me feel that i made a perfect choice when i stepped through their door, not having heard of them - this was my second day ever in leeuwarden. it was quiet when i arrived, but buzzed with life shortly afte "
"the decor is farmhouse chic, very casual and cozy. we had the soup of the day, a chicken cream soup served with big chunks of homemade breads. i had cheese fondue, served with more wonderful bread and a variety of fresh veggies and fruits. my husband had what we would call a pot roast. with all entrees, they serve a salad, chunky french fries, and a veggie mix of peas, beans and asparagus in a mint sauce. everything was top notch. i would go back here again!"
"i love their meat plates, always cooked to perfection. and the broodplank de lux, yummiiii!! well be back soon :)"
what a wonderful experience in our town! the food was the best we ever had. so full of taste and color. a true experience we wont forget!
"great service, historical atmosphere and perfect menue for a good price. we paid 70 euro for two people (3menu, 2 wines and 2 likour). every meal was handmade and the soup was amazing!"
"beautiful setting. lots of choice. very good food. tastefull menus, even a local fries menu. i can recommend it. nice wine. staff is very friendly and extremely helpfull. price is correct."

"the restaurant is located in an old palace, where some members of the nassau family lived in the 17th and 18th century. us heit ( our dad ) was william louis, the first count of that family in charge of the northern part of the netherlands. there portraits show strong men and women, the alpha persons of that peri "
you know that feeling that you get when you just have to close your eyes when eating something good? that is what you get at this restaura 
"we had a 5 courses dinner deal for ony 25 euro. every drink that you get will add up to the price though. surrounded by portraits of the nassau family we had a royal dinner in restaurant us heit, really good."
"only ‚Ç¨25 will get you a 5-course fantastic meal; throw in ‚Ç¨23 for a bottle of wine, ‚Ç¨4 for a bottle of water and ‚Ç¨4.5 for a really nice coffee with home-made chocolates and you have a 3-hour diner experience you wont forget for a real bargain!! combine with a stay at the hotel, and a pair will have a great weekend out!"
"monday evening‚Äôs dinner here was very good! i don‚Äôt eat meat often but when i do i want a good quake. the quality of the meat - perfect, the waiting time for our meals - normal. good servi "
very nice place. the dinner we had was good and you easily stay longer for drinks. friendly staff. i would recommend to make reservations when you want to eat there in the weekend.

we had a big group dinner recently and were very impressed with the food etc.  good wibes and they did a great job with their food presentation.  we liked how they served their main dishes on a wooden board etc.  definitely will be back.
"i came here for a drink. first i was thinking of taking a cup of tea but there was just tea on the menu, so i decided to take a hot chocolate with cream. with it i ordered an apple pie. service was very quick. almost immediately the hot chocolate arrived together with a very big piece of apple pie, also with a lot of cream. i can tell that i wasnt hungry for dinner. :)"
"favorite grand cafe in leeuwarden. most of the times here for a nice drink on their outside terrace or to overcome a hangover with their terrific 12 uurtje lunch option. great food, large proportions. ever tried a salmon uitsmijter? go for it."
"we always went for a couple of drinks and some food, several times. it looks like a nice old, dark pub and has got a lovely environment. decorations suit the venue and warm and friendly service rounds it of perfectly. i never had any complaints and i went a couple of times during the day and at night. if you eat something there, order inkvisringe :) amazing "
this restaurant has a good extensive menus on offer. the food is served by friendly efficient staff. i had a pepper steak which was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend this restaurant.
a charming place with friendly service and an excellent choice of dishes for lunch. food is good and plentiful. id come again.
we ate there on two separate occasions. the ribs are fantastic! a member of our party had the lamb chops and said they were very good. next time i am in town i will be sure to visit there again.
"nice restaurant, friendly staff and quite big food portions. also a generous amount of cream comes with the appelcake :d"
"in the centre of the city near the central canal there is a fine place to eat, drink and look at the people passing by. young and friendly staff serving nice food."
"my experience here was great. i came here alone. even so, i was accepted to take a seat at one of their tables. took tagliatelle with chicken and a glass of white wine. service was great, food excellent, people were friendly."
was looking for a place to grab some food and spotted this italian place. so decided to grab a pizza and glad of wine.  the combination was good. the pizza was very tasty. too bad i had to leave leeuwarden the next day .
we stopped by here one morning for a few beers and looked at the menu for dinner optio 
"pleasant spot on a square, well patronised by locals, enormous drinks menu, so if you are into gin or cocktails definitely a place to visit. some good drinkable wines at reasonable prices, and the same for the food. italian biased but other choices too, food equally enjoyable at sensible prices. tip try the cheese board plank to go with drinks. note this restaurant only accepts credit cards in payment!!"
i recently visited the fellini city lounge with a large group of friends ( 36) the staff catered well with the large number of customers. the food was delicious and well presented. the drinks menu was also good. all 36 left having enjoyed good food and an enjoyable experience.
simple menu but super tasty food. service very friendly and quick. good relaxed vibe for a city centre lunch.
"nice service, could speak perfect english and had english menus as well. ordered tea which had a wide variety of flavours and the club sandwich which was huge and the ingredients tasted lovely and fresh. would go there again for sure"
went here with a large group of people. still they managed to give us a nice choice of food and service. have an allergy? no problem! even tho its not originally in the set menu they still managed to help out and create a stunning replacement.
this is a very good italian restaurant. the staff were helpful efficient and friendly. the menus was good and the food was well cooked and delicious. i would highly recommend a visit.
nice atmosphere familie feeling in combination with good food and normalprices close by museum and parking
been here with friends in a raining day of summer. we sit outside anyway and we have great time. the food was really good and the service good also. i will come back for sure.
after visiting the fries museum we went here for an early dinne 
before going to a concert we decided to have dinner close  
"this is a pleasant place with generous portions and cheerful staff. the restaurant is relatively centrally located in a town of very walkable size, and the frisian museum is just next door."
we needed a hand with some of the translation of the menu and the waiter was fabulous. he wasnt sure of a couple of the words so he came back in seconds with his i pad with google translate on it. what service. we had a superb meal too. cant fault the place at all.
"the space in the restaurant allows for comfort. the restaurant has a great atmosphere and good ambience. i went with a party of about 14,- service was good and fairly speedy. though the food is good, portion sizes are far too large and should be cut in half. great cappucino to end off the meal!"
"we spent an evening here with a large group on a busy friday evening. food was fantastic, very authentic turkish cuisine, great lentil soup. service was a bit on the slow side, but given that it was a friday evening and packed, i guess that is understandable."
"great taste and logic price! its one of my fave restaurant in leeuwarden. hidden gem. very good service, good location. this place very good if u come with large group or just with friends. big space dinning area."
food is of excellent quality and taste. friendly staff. certainly recommend this restaurant. they also have a selection for people unfamiliar with the quisine so you can taste different dishes
"inviting ambiance ... relaxed, intimate, easy - well organized - food was serverd quickly and yet delicious  - easy to find, only 10 minutes walking from the station of leeuwarden."
me and my boyfriend went to saray on a saturday night. it is a big restaurant er there was still room for us fortunately! the staff is very friendly and the food is great!
"its not excellent, but its okay. and it really is. shop is clean, waitresses are polite, coffee is allright. dont expect haute cuisine, i think nobody does. but again, it is really okay and a nice spot for a short stay with a hot coffee when youre cold after a city walk or need a rest. "
after the exposition in the fries museum it is very nice to have a goof cup of coffee and dutch appeltaart at doppio.s.
we ate here with a little over a year old and a three year old. and even though id been there before i never realized how kids friendly it was. happily surprised.
"lovely choice of coffees and teas. and not unimportant the food (lunch) is nice as well. quality ingredients, good service."
"doppio is a modern cafe right next to the market place in leeuwarden. it is rather pricey but the food & beverages are amazing and the employees are super friendly and they have great english skills. only neg point is that the cafe has an almost sterile feeling (white tables, arranged in rows)."

"the staff were all friendly and welcoming and spoke english to me throughout the evening, i was also given the english menu. we paid 22.50‚Ç¨ each and could order 2 dishes at a time, and when we finished them, we could order 2 more etc until we were full. there was also a nice cocktail menu. unfortunately you had to pay extra for desserts but you can just fill up on the tapas dishes instead! very good value for money and really loved the whole evening!"
"we had a great evening at la cubanita in leeuwarden. even though the place was busy, the staff was very kind and attentive.the food was delicious and the whole ambiance with the latin music was great. special thanks to the manager, amanda dekker for taking such good care of us."
what can i say but just great! all you can eat tapas for 22.50 euros (drinks not included) on a saterday evening. (17.50 euro from sunday till thursda 
"monday evening, looking for a place to eat and on recommendation of my daughter i visited la cubanita. the place was not full, so a table without reservation was no porblem. the staff was nice and willing to explain the ordering procedure; select your 2 dishes at a time and write this on a beer mat! when the beer mat is taken, 5 or 10 minutes later your order is being served. fast and very tasty. atmosphere is nice, busy and in spanish/cuban atmosphere. the staff works fast and asks everytime if they are allowed to take the empty plates. the next order is picked up every time they pass your table. cost is low during the week its 17,50 only the drinks and/or cocktails are separate. if you like spanish tapas and you are looking for a relaxed and nice atmosphere surely a place to put in your diary!"
cosy atmosphere.  great price. and an enormous choice of tapas. friendly personel. had a great time with my colleagues
"la cubanita is a great restaurant, one of my favorites. their unlimited tapas deal is decently priced and i love the variety of dishes. i dont appreciate that they dont serve tap water though. i can understand their biggest income is from serving drinks but i wish they understood how bad it feels having to pay 2/3 euro for fancy still water. in terms of customer service i would really start serving your customers tap water. my only recommendation as your food is great and your servers are always very friendly. the water is just a big thing for me. "
great value and such a wide range of cute little bite size tap 
very good pizzas and good service. we ordered our pizzas on the phone and they were ready on due time. the quality is very good for pizzas that are not that expensive.
"apparently these guys just won the best pizza of leeuwarden competition! well, i couldnt agree more! very cozy place, with a lot of great italian dishes on the menu"
"we wanted to order a bottle of whine and we got an excellent recommendation, so ask them about it! the pizzas had a true italian flat crust. we had an amazing dinner, partially due to the lovely waitress."
"lovely atmosphere, had to wait a tad for my food because they were baking it fresh but it was soooo worth it. ordered the lasagna with mozzarella and it was one of the best dishes ive had in my life, my friends both ordered a pizza each and both were really satisfied, would recommend without a doubt "
known mostly by the locals this italian restaurant is one of the hidden gems the city has to off 
"if you want to go for a good pizza and dont want to spend too much, this is the place to go! the pizza is a good size and often the food is ready in no time!"
"made an unplanned stop for pizza.  pizza was authentic italian, a was the wine and service. will be back"
"this is a great restaurant, with amazing food for a decent price. the service of the students is very genuine! can only recommend!"
i have eaten at wannee a few times (for as well dinner and lunch) and it was never disappointin 
absolutely amazing.  a 6 course menu with vegetables at the star. looked like all locks ingredients too.  the staff were absolutely fantastic. what a fantastic introduction to the city.
wonderful in every way is how i would sum up my experience at this restaurant. it is part of the hotel school in leeuwarden and is one of five in the count 
the wonderful restaurant that combines quality and professionalism. great breakfast and magnificent dinner paired with the perfect wines. we are extremely happy with the service.üòÄ
great service with a smile and delicious combination of flavour 
it was delicious. the dishes were well thought and a real discovery. excellent quality and the service was perfect. the staff is very kind and helpful. we had breakfast and lunch there and both times it was awesome. each dish was beautiful.
"not in the city centre but in the middle of a modern campus-like area this is a true surprise. modern concepts both in interior as well as in the (choice of) food. greet looking and tasting dishes , 80 percent vegetable based and typically dutch. even a very nice and good appetizer based on the traditional rustic ‚Äòsnert‚Äô soup. the young student staff provides exceptional professional service."
the menu changes regularly so its not so hard to come back again soon. we had the six course fixed menu which was totally full of trea 
"this is an amazing restaurant, one of the most creative ive ever ate at. we had the six course tasting menu. first we were seated in the bar and given three snacks, more like amuses: freeze dried vegetables, a one-bite fish taco, and a cucumber based drink. then we were seated in the very spacious dining room which had two tables for groups of 10 and maybe 8 tables for couples. it is very modern style, with very high ceilings. at night it is very atmospheric, with low lightin "
"good food, nice wines and great service, we had a six course dinner in a nice and cozy atmosphere, we will come back after the seasonal menu will change"
we got a warm welcome with some amuses. the food is beautifully presented and there is a good explanati

looking for a new experience in leeuwarden i stumbled onto this restaurant. initially i didnt know it was part of the leeuwarden hotel schoo 
"a couple of weeks ago we went to wannee. it was a surprising experience, in it‚Äôs most positive meaning! we were welcomed in the bar with a glass of cava and several appetizers, among which the beetroot dim sum üëåüèΩ. the restaurant has a very open and modern design that suits the atmosphere. the diner menu is based on the 80/20 principle and surprises you with very tasty and appealing dishes such as kfc cauliflower (better than the actual kfc ü§´) and a beautiful beluga style version of potato and leek. cassian served us some great wines (and some great stories!) and j yoon and irene served us in a very hospitable and professional way. we stayed in notiz hotel, so we were lucky and got to enjoy breakfast in wannee as well. wannee serves a standard breakfast √°nd an a la carte breakfast. on this a la carte menu you find both local and international bites, which are a great contribution to your breakfast! we especially loved the french toast and the miso soup. during breakfast we were served by mark, who was just a natural. long story short; when in leeuwarden, visit wannee. the food, the drinks, but especially the hospitality of the students guarantee a great experience!"
modern restaurant at the higher hotel school to train the future hoteliers. we had the 4 course menu with the wine arrangement that serves typically dutch dishes in a modern version; we liked the taste of the food and the friendly service. tip of the day; order the coffee service with chocolate surprises! 
"this restaurant is at the stenden hotel and managed by the students. rated one of the top 100 vegetable restaurants in the world. yes they have also proteins, but the focus is 80% vegetables and 20% proteins. very nice to see students under the leadership of this amazing chef who runs a very large f&b organization. with some 3,000 students and many different outlets, this is one very large organization. bravo!!"
"never found better service. the staff was very helpful, nice and friendly. the food was of an unexpected quality. a place to come back!"
"we were extremely surprised at the quality, creativity and variety of the light four course and six course menus availab "

"we have visited wannee for breakfast staying at stenden hotel last august and were so impressed decided to come back. well, fine dining delivered! their values are quality, health, value, organic and local. delicious food and wine, relaxing atmosphere, lovely staff and the whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable. we will be back once in this neck of the woods. thank you, great job! "
"i have stayed at stenden hotel numerous times and breakfast at wannee is always excellent. the restaurant is clean, service is very good and variety of buffet is excellent. additionally omletts, egg benedict and other breakfast items can be ordered. coffee and juices are of excellent quality. the buffet station is user friendly in that it is divided into two sections, thus uncluttering any guests who take from the buffet simultaneously."
albert kooy is a champion of the new dutch cuisine. on the basis of sometimes old and forgotten vegetables he creates real amazing dishes. with this he inspires (and teach) the international hospitality students who run this restaurant. they do so with great enthusiasm. it was one of my best (and i have been in quite a few) restaurant experiences in holland. at a price level just above fast food you eat and have an experience at michelin star level.
"okay, we did not expect this...but what a find! located in the training facility of the stenden hotel, this restaurant serves a killer meal for a extremely friendly price. they use the 80-20 concept (80% vegetable-20% protein) and still manage (üòâ) to produce excellent dishes! we will be back!"
"wannee is a food adventure in a beautiful dining room. in the centre is a fire element circled by rosemary citrus and chili plants. lots of wood and space to really enjoy the amazing creations in which local veges are the heroes. yesterday the 6-course meal included venison, sweetbread, jerusalem artichokes, salsify, chicory, and they were prepared with so much passion, it was such a joy to eat. we chose a 4- course wine menu too and the wines just perfected the dishes and the other way rou "
my wife and i ate here and found it to be a great restaurant. i was a bit skeptical because it is in a university and all of the servers are students. this turned out to be a big plus. what any of our servers lacked in experience was made up by their enthusiasm and genuine care to ensure we were treated well. we each opted for the multicourse menu - i had the 6 dish and my wife the 4 dish. each of us opted for the same number of wine pairing. each of the courses was outstanding and the wines complemented each. our servers explained each course and provided details on each wine. our entre 
"as we owned and ran restaurants a teaching restaurant is fun. here food is also excellent and wine is interesting. very reasonable price. service young but professional, we had business to talk and did so effectively. no muzak. good acoustics. recommendable!"
"as an alumni, stayed in the hotel for one night to celebrate my graduation. came for lunch in the restaurant and me and my girlfriend had 4 courses with the wine arrangemen "
"the food was excellent and imaginative. the accompanying wines carefully chosen. the service was perfect. all of this for an incredibly low price. if we had been staying longer, we would have gone back!"
"the service at wannee is very good, considering that most of the waiters and waitrons are students doing real world learning. i had breakfast at wannee for 5 days recently and the breafast buffet variety is excellent. the variety of various egg dishes that can also be ordered in addition to the buffet, are absolutely magnificent, and the young chef who was on duty 4 of the 5 days is extremely passionate about the entire experience of food preparation which follows through in the taste and presentation of dishes. the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. particularly recommendable are the eggs benedict. the restaurant is very clean and the aesthetically pleasing environment creates an all round gastronomic expereince. the best is the variety of deliciously prepared breads and rolls - real comfort food!"
nobody should left leeuwarden without a dinner or lunch in this restaura 
"charming, original and beautiful dishes. friendly and authentic service. very affordable with the course options. what a gem of a place!"
"i had a lunch with 2 friends, the food was good and the price is not high. friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere! i recommend restaurant wannee"
"excellent food, excellent plating, excellent service, excellent prices. i will return to this place for sure."
"we ate 5 verry tastefull courses in this teaching restaurant. the studentes explained with every course, in good english, what was served. the ingredients use are very green and pure. the decoraties is like cousy industrial. i liked it vera michael. if i had not known, i would not have noticed it was a teaching restaurant. would go here again!"
"searching the best restaurant in leeuwarden through the tripadvisor app, it led me to this restaurant, wannee. we had to walk a bit because it is located outside of the centrum, but it was worth every step, this is why "
"its been a pleasure to eat in restaurant wannee. great food, nice service by young professionals. also the atmosphere is really fresh. will definitely come back next year"
"6 course delicatessen matched with 6 wines for a total of ‚Ç¨53,20 best value for money ever. everything was perfect. a must when visiting leeuwarden"
just be mindful that if going to breakfast late thet will not necessarily replenish everything do have the taster mennu!
"nice place to be, good food, diets are no problem at all. its a school and restaurant in one. you notice that but its not annoying."
my wife and i stayed at the leeuwarden school of hospitality hotel. attached to this is their restaurant wannee. the entire complex is run by students and if their efforts are any indication then the netherlands can look forward to an excellent level of service in the hospitality indust 
a pleasant restaurant with fine ambience. its a student run place as part of the university hotel. highly recommended as is the local wheat beer!
fantastic echte dutch experience for breakfast - everything from boerenkool and nasi goreng for breakfast plus the best freshly-baked bread with all the toppings youd expect in the netherlands: hagelslag and jam!
"i was in leeuwarden on business staying in the wtc hotel and a german colleague of mine took me to this restaurant. outstanding from arrival to departure. its a training college for the hotel trades and most of the staff are trainees. i was a bit dubious upon or arrival as the restaurant was very quiet but my attitude soon changed. our waitress - miri - was from budapest- and she was brilliant. she was smart, articulate and explained all about the meals and wines. we opted for the six course taster menu with wines and each and very course was a taste explosion absolutely stunning. from presentation to taste, tip top in every way. the supervisor - angelina and the restaurant manager - yannich (i think thats how you spell his name) - were extremely helpful in every way. i cannot understand why the restaurant was so empty as it was only 30 euros for the six course taster menu - absolute bargain. we went the next night and the place was packed and due to staff shortages they were only doing the 6 course taster menu - but yannich had a word with the kitchen and we could choose from the normal menu. you have got to visit this place ts brilliant. well done to all the trainees and the experts in the background."
wannee is overseen by a master chef and run by the hospitality students at stenden. we had the 3 course with the 3 wine pairings. portions were small and creatively plated. service was impeccable.
"the restaurant is run by the students at stenden university with input from expert staff. chef albert kooy has devised a menu heavily focused on fresh, local dutch food and cuisine. the intent is to represent dutch food (min 80%) and local produce. the menu is planned emphasizing seasons, health, taste, and local traditions keeping animal protein at 20%. they offer a fixed-price menu allowing for 3-6 courses. wines have been chosen by their resident registered vinoloogs (rv), mr. douwe wiersma and mr. shane de bruijn. rv is a certification offered by the dutch wine acade "
we had 6 courses. each course was good of taste. very attentive service by students of .stenden. nice place to sit. in summer you also can have dinner outside.
"the menu formula is orginal, each course comes for 6 euros.  nice, open restaurant with lots of daylight.  very attentive service."
"this restaurant run by students of the stenden university is one of the best restaurants ive been to. the portions are rather small but with just 15 ‚Ç¨ for a 3 course menu you cant go wrong. the dishes are very tasty because the restaurant places importance to each ingredient they use as they hold a 80:20 concept. 80 % vegetables, 20% meat. definitely recommending this to anyone who prefers vegetables over meat and rural ingredients. the staff is very friendly, attentive and makes sure that all is to your satisfactio "
"i went to dinner at restaurant wannee with a friend of mine and it was an absolutely amazing experience. we had the 3 course menu for which we chose the spinach salad with mullet, the chicken wings with stars and stripes and the strawberries desert with basil sorbet which blew us away. the dishes are designed so that the natural flavors of the ingredients can be tasted and experienced ful "
"we had 2 top evenings having dinner here last evening and today. very friendly staff. students from the stenden university. they do this more than ok. food was very good. small portions, but if you take the 6 course diner( only 30 euro )very tasty and special sometimes :) and the accompagnied wines, you will have a very nice evening. enjoy, i know we have :)"
"small portions make one great meal with lots of varieties. real hostmanship, high quality! good wines. it is only the location but with a good walk you easily end up in this great place."
this was my 2nd time dining there and it was even more delicious than the first time. despite that students so the cooking and serving you feel like you are in a high ranked restaurant with pretty low prices. we were lucky to taste new menu of 6 courses. each of them was surprisingly tasty and rich of flavours. portions were small (cannot be otherwise with 6-course menu) but at the end you feel pretty full. this restaurant will definately stay in our list for the future.
"first class dining on a budget. this restaurant offered a surprisingly fresh, modern and engaging menu with an even better value. we enjoyed a 8 course tasting menu with a variety of dishes, most of them with local ingredients. i like the focus of vegetables and less on meat and fish."
"this is a good restaurant if you come as a couple, but also with a family. it is cozy, relaxed atmosphere, and the personnel was very friendly on both times we were ther "

"wonderful atmosphere, friendly and quick service, the pannekeoks were very, very good and the pricing is ok."
"we visited as a family of 6 and my elderly parents requested small pancakes as they couldnt face a large one. each one of us enjoyed the experience, although we almost had to be rolled out of the ship as they are so filling. in the heatwave it was a little stuffy, but the staff are friendly and our waitress thought we were german before serving us in english - amazing to be accommodated in our language with such ease. well done to the manageress who served us, i only wish i spoke dutch as well as you spoke english - thank you."
"restaurant in a boat, beautifully decorated. good pancakes, friendly staff. tons of pancakes to choose from."
"i really like this place to have lunch or dinner, especially to go there with people who have not been in the netherlands or groningen. the restaurant itself is in a ship, which by itself is an experience and a great environment. they serve a lot of different pancakes: from the typical sweet ones to the pizza like pancakes."
we went with 8 persons (including 4 kids) and had great pancakes. service was friendly and fast. the pancakes were excellent! the restaurant is in an old freight-ship which is located in a canal just outside the city centre. this gave it a very special atmosphere.
"the baby and i shared a lovely, big apple and ginger pancake - think pizza size. the staff were all friendly and accommodating, bringing high chairs and a toy. its quite dark inside and the canal your window is next to might not always be the cleanest but definitely recommend for food and just enjoying being on a boat. "
this is a great place for families. good food and a cosy atmosphere. ill be making regular trips there with my 2 young boys.
"a great budget buy. had the bacon, ham, and cheese pancake and could not finish it all even though i wanted to try a sweet pancake as well as a savory. quick service. very very family oriented so expect lots of children and the accompanying noise."
great find catering to every taste. also had gluten-free selection for everything which was really great. staff was friendly and very attentive especially with children. definitely worth a visit.
i love this ship. big and good pancakes in a ship with pirate decor. the restaurant chef is really kind. if you have just a little hunger you can share your pancake in two.
"a dutch pancake is a treat ... and ours were huge - larger than the plate they were served on. i had the ginger and he had the apple, we could hardly finish them - good value for the food and a novelty to be aboard a real ship and looking out the portholes at the various boats passing on the canal. service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere laid back and unfussy - we were not disappointed with our meal or our service."
the pancakeship is not only a destination for our little friends. also adults can enjoy an adventure on the pancake ship. lovely (huge) pancakes that can be either sweet or savery.
"there are many choices for the topping, and they dare to combine with asian taste such as pecel with sate sauce. and they give discount for students, too. nice! :)"

"just back from dinner here and in a euphoric state. every mouthful made my eyes pop, full of superlative flavours especially the pear with citrus ice cream and the thing with goats cheese and sea lettuce - ooooooh! a fabulous and memorable experience. thank-you to the kitchen and friendly front-of-house crew at eindeloos, i will remember this night of happy foodie highs xxx"
"my wife and i have known the chef and owner willem schaafsma ever since he started here 9 years ago. under previous ownership the place already had a good reputation and willem has been able to not only keep it up, but improve further. while using much local and biological ingredients he time and again knows to surprise with imaginative and creative dishes. even the amuse bouches are special and delicious. the, partly new, staff was very friendly and knowledgable. no wonder, since willem enjoys training staff himself. his jre membership is certainly warrented."
"this restaurant serves delightful and very creative dishes, abundant with flavours and texture made from seasonal and regional ingredients. the menu is a surprise, but dont let that stop you from visiting. every course is intelligently designed and as their flavour strength and their volume increases so do the matching wines. the rhythm and pace of the courses are perfect, giving you the chance to savour the experience. staff is very polite, helpful and friendly."
we had a 4 course surprise menu accompanied by some amuses. all the courses were creative and well prepared. all the products are sourced local and the staff can tell where they come from.
we came to leeuwarden for business and it‚Äôs rare when you have a beautiful time as a family while traveling for work. incredible two hours to rest and immerse yourself into conversations while kind and warm people help you to understand how different tastes are combined within the most delicious mousses and main courses. beautiful evening with incredibly welcoming and kind people who work at the restaurant!
"a warm welcome,we selected the 6 course meal with the wines.good service throughout with fun explanations of the wines that accompanied each dish. also the dishes were fully described and were all very enjoyable.attention to allergy details for one of us was very professionally dealt with and did not distract the enjoyment of the meal. we couldn‚Äôt wish for a better celebration of our 35th wedding anniversary. when visiting holland again, we will definitely come back."
"eindeloos is an exclusive dining experience in restaurant. i heard they have one michelin star, but im not sure about th "
"we were so lucky that our bed & breakfast in leeuwarden recommended eindeloos. it came highly recommended and did not disappoint. you choose the number of courses you want (we chose 5) and then the menu is a total surprise, and up to the whimsy and imagination of the chef and his use of locally sourced seasonal ingredients. there is no written menu; you can mention anything you do not want/like to eat. then you sit back, and prepared to be wowed by fabulous course after course, starting with 4 amuse bouches, followed by our faultess, well-executed 5 courses. we chose the wine pairing to accompany our menu, and the pairings were excellent. we speak basic dutch and the attentive staff went out of their way to meticulously explain each course in english. the entire evening was a culinary adventure. we look forward to returning to eindeloos/leeuwarden to experience the chefs gourmet exploration of ingredients in another season."
we were in leeuwarden for business and we like to combine these trips with culinary adventures. leeuwarden is an historical frisian city and is a great destination in its own rig 
we are not usually multi degustation peop 
the particularity of this restaurant is that it offers various surprise menus of a chosen number of courses taking into consideration the clients food preferences. we chose a three course fish menu which going along became a four course menu inserting a delicious selection of cheeses before the desert. the dinner started off with a number of delicious amuse-bouches and others to follow in between the various dishes. everything was prepared with great care and inspiration. a fair selection of wine was available by the glass so to combine and taste different wines with each dish. overall a different dining experience. service was very good with perfect explanation of what each dish consisted of. no idea though beforehand how much any given menu would cost (they propose up to eight courses if you wish meat dishes to be included). thus also the total charge will be a surprise. in this case we both agreed that the ratio quality to cost was very reasonable. i definitely would recommend this restaurant which besides the surprise of the food also offers a pleasant and calm atmosphere.
"its not an easy task to find a good restaurant when visiting the northern dutch provinces and although there are some good ones, eindeloos is really the best. cooking is on michelin star level, and service is good and quirky. the menu options, we took the 3 course but you can take more, are easy to understand and the options offered were excellent. reluctantly i ate pigs tongue, which was really good and soup with frisian dry sausage foam, which was a novelty for me and tasted very nice. we paid 60 euro/head (tips inlcuded) including wine which is a very good deal for the quality and the service offered. i will definitely come back to eindeloos."
we had the 5 course surprise menu wich in the end had turned into somewhere between 9-10 small and bigger plates of delicious food. be very hungry before you enter eindeloos because they will fill you up...the service was the best with several waitresses and the chef and owner himself serving you.  
"decoration is simple but the restaurant is full on a weekday tuesday: the kitchen is valued, and rightly so. no menu, 3, 4 or 5 courses with only fresh products. choice of meat or fish and the milk allergy of my partner is meticulously considered. every dish is a picture and all the flavors show to full advantage. the waiters are very attentive and informative. good choice of wines by the glass and unusual: a white portuguese turns to be perfect and the red italian is a hit. here you will gladly return."
"this restaurant received very high scores and we can only agree with these evaluations. although the interiour is not quite special, we appreciate the different photographs on the wal "
"we spent an evening during the week in this restaurant and ordered a 5-course dinner which was accompanied by a wine set. the food was fantastic and got better after each round. the wines perfectly suited the food. service was very helpful, friendly and provided handy advises. a must when in town! make sure to reserve a table since it might get busy depending on the season."
we had booked for lunch but were not advised that we could only get a set menu. menu was enjoybale and we had a very long and also enjoyed the french wines.
"as one of many restaurants we enjoyed during a gourmet tour of friesland by boat this one stands out! first of all, there is no menu. one just selects the number of courses youd like to have and the food starts coming... one of our party is restricted to a gluten free diet but the chef accomodated him as readily as everyone else. the meal began with three elegant and delicious amuses and their promise was maintained throughout the dinner. two of our dishes included both meat and fish, which is unusual, but they were beautifully paired to great effect. if you decide eat at eindeloos set aside the evening to dine. the courses were spaced well apart in time, we would have prefered they move along a little faster. dishes were appropriately sized - not overwhelming but we certainly felt well fed by the evenings end."
"if you would like to visit a great chinese restaurant, to have a big fantastic dinner and enjoy of nice atmosphere, i recommend this restaurant definitely. you will find here delicious chinese cuisine, big portions of any dishes, very attentive host and very nice prices. enjoy the garden of china in wonderful leeuwarden!"
this place has been around since i was a child an visited my grandfather its has lots of memories an still the ‚Äúbami with noodles‚Äù taste the same that must be a plus that food travels with time. had a lovely meal an the price is still good. found out that is now owned by second generation of the uncle our family knew when i was teenager. would definitely recommend
"i went to leeuwarden for business ,and chose this restaurant to have a diner after having the meeting .the waiter is very friendly when we walked into the restaurant,we said we want to try some real chinese food,they recommended some food ,and i want it cooked very spicy ,it turned out the chief didnt make us disappointed,the food is very amazing !i come to here again next time !"
"everything was very tasty. we ordered indonesian rise table and house rames. this gave us a large selection of small dishes to try. each one was delicious and beautifully presented, being kept warm on heated trays. with both rice and noodles a great meal. coffee or tea included."
"this is a really wonderful place after i tasted all chinese restaurant in leeuwarden, the food is always fresh and well-portion, the owner has very good manner and welcomed us, also it was a rainy day, they even offered us cup of warm drink and tissue ! at the end of my trip , i organized a party with my friends with a buffet. the food was really good and had a really good experience in leeuwarden ! the owner always came to us to ask if the food is good, i really cant understand that person who said the worst food and service how it comes, maybe he went to the wrong restaurant? i m really appreciated that had a good time and knew those lovely people in leeuwarden! üòä definitely will come back one day! "
"we enjoy their take-away menus, they are good in flavors and absolutely fair in price. the service is always nice, and normally quite fast. whenever feeling for a dutch-chinese meal, this is the place to be! see you soon."
"i discovered this restaurant when i was studying at stenden many years ago. my partner and i have been going regularly ever since. we went for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic last week and the food did not disappoint! if youd like to eat there on a saturday, i highly recommend you make a reservatio "

"we came here with the four of us, we had reservations (recommended!) and over some nice glass of indian red wine we ordered chicken masala, trout, dal and another dish i cannot remember alongside with garlic and sesame naan. the food was delicious, i had medium spicy and could easily go with hot spicy. the restaurant was very nice and the service was tops. if you in leeuwarden and feel like indian food, i highly recommend this place. you won‚Äôt be disappointed."
"great atmosphere, friendly and keen stuff, delicious food -  what else needed for perfect dinner with family!?!"
"being a real indian food lover i visited many indian restaurants. this one suprised me with really tasty dishes, cooked from fresh ingredients. even on a weekdag, the placement is busy and you better make a reservation! really recommended for taste, price, friendly staff."
"we had a meal with large group pf 14. food and service vey good! nice presentation, everyone was enthousiastic, even those who never enjoyed and indian meal before"
"we found this place on tripadvisor and due to the positive reactions we reserved a spot here on saturday evening (which was necessary!). and the positive reactions were right. the food is amazing, the staff is friendly, prices are good and it is a cozy place. we took the chicken tikki masala & the korai gosht (which is a bit spicy). we can definitely recommend it!"
"the atmosphere there was quite great, the service (could be a bit faster) was very attentive and the food. the food was amazing, very flavorful and amazingly well prepared. the lamb as promised was tender, chicken was juicy. the only slight downside were the mushrooms in the dishes. they felt watery. overall anwell worth experience, worth another visit when i have more time"
"when you visit a popular busy restaurant inevitably you will have to wait a little to be served. definitely the case here but when the food arrives you realize it‚Äôs worth the wait. inspired menu with a choice of diverse dishes. warm plates, food warmers and generous portions add to the experience but the taste explosions are the star. "
"had the chicken tikka masala, just the right amount of spicy for me, my colleagues had the murg madras, warning, its very spicy! :-d"
the curry was just the right amount of heat. i regret not being able to go more than once. just beat the the crowd.
visited with young children and their grandparents with a range of languages - the whole family was made welcome and the service was relaxed and friendly.  food was very good and well presented. decor was themed but without being too cliched.  good vegetarian selection.
"food was very tasty and service was top notch. waitress was very aware of glutenfree diet necessary to our daughter. athmosprere, price and quality all deserves 5 stars!"
nicely presented and tasty food. the service was very friendly and efficien 
the best indian i have had by far and the best meal ive had whilst on the continent in the last two weeks.
"one entered the premises on the say so of a business associate. we were promptly met by a delightful lady (although her indian origins were questionable) who sat as in the corner whilst making a table for us. we approached our freshly laid table and as you do, sniffed the table cloth and immediately approved. like an indian meado "
"we visited this restaurant on a monday night and were almost put off by a party of 24 who were already seated. however, on the assurance of our waitress that no great delays etc., would occur we sat down. we had the usual popadoms and some lovely unusual tamarind dip. after which we had three curries between us. my wife likes prawns, and that curry was good. the fish curry was even better, but the lamb madras was really excellent. big pieces of tender lamb that had been marinated so long that the taste was right in the meat. hot and spicy and the best curry i have had for years."
"the food in this restaurant, especially the thalis, is very tasty! good variety and also lots of vegetarian options"
"we really enjoyed having dinner at this lovely restaurant. the menu was very varied, and the prices very reasonable. we opted for the set menu(thali royal) and it was delicious. every dish was explained by the hostess together with some cultural background, making the experience complete."
"very popular in leeuwarden this is the place to be if you crave for indian food in the netherlands, though the spices been mellowed down to cater to european platter it still is true to its country of origi "
"in december ive been to this restaurant with my family. its quite a small but very attractive restaurant. the walls are decoracted with indian statues, lights, paintings etc. the service was slow, in my opinion a little too slow. we arrived at 7 pm but the waiter asked just 30 minutes later what we wanted to drink. most of the staff doesnt speak dutch, but they do understand amd speak english. we ordered 3 different menus. one vegetarian, one meat and one mixed meat/vegetables menu. the food was absolutely delicious. the nice thing is that you can taste out of every little pan. so you eat a varierty of food served with naanbread. overal i had a great evening and i ate more than enough meals."
"i ordered the jamuna special biryani. and it was truly delicious. regardless of the price of ‚Ç¨15, it scored very high on my expectation looking at a small town like leeuwarden. really love the way they keep our food warm, so it doesnt get cold as few minutes pass by."
"if we go to leeuwarden, we always try to have a meal here. thank goodness we reserved, as it was full and busy like a beehive and people were waiting for a free table. we already knew what we wanted to order, same procedure as every time we go, the thali dish, and so did not need to look at the menu and then wait again for our order to be taken. the staff were all friendly, the meal served hot and we were not disappointed, it was still as good as the last time we had eaten here. if you go, i would recommend you reserve. mondays closed."
"this is my favourite indian restaurant in leeuwarden. maybe even my favourite indian restaurant ever! i have been going here for about 8 years and its always a treat. i love the atmosphere with the indian nicknacks and music. ive tried quite a few things on their menu and everything has been delicious. the last time i went it was even better than i remember! our go-to favourite is the spinach and chicken dish. the channa masala is also really good. oh and get some peshwari naan, you wont regret it! "
"this is a rare indian restaurant. i am a fan of indians but jamuna is one of the best ive tried. the starter was an explosion of flavours with a fantastic and light dressing, and i had never tasted something like the two main courses we tried. service was fast and effective and the setting avoids to much kitsch. will definitely retur (with clothes that can easily be washed, we still have a strong smell on our coats :))."
"we arrived back from the wadden island late in leeuwarden, and although it was saturday night, we could feel it would not be easy to find a place to e "
"indian is one of my favourite cuisines so i usually look out for a decent indian restaurant on my travels. this one, whilst not up amongst the best, was pretty good and ill come back if im in this neighbourhood again. the service was a little slow but its fair to say the restaurant was very bus "
"if you are from the uk and end up, for your sins, in friesland then head to leeuwarden and visit jamuna. fantastic food, atmosphere and wonderful staff.  well worth a visit."
"one of my favorite restaurants in leeuwarden. the food is excellent, and the owners are friendy.  would recommend it to all my friends and family."
"brilliant food in a relaxed, cosy and no-nonsense restaurant. both service and dishes are great: ranging from friendly mild to challenging hot. an absolute must-visit when in town"
"we love the spicy food and here it is very good. if you gonna eat here , you have to wait for √† long time before diner is served , but its worth."
"this is one of my favourite restaurants in leeuwarden. the food is delicious and i love trying different dishes (almost) every time i go. i would recommend the samosas, chicken and spinach (murg aur palak i believe), and peshwari naa "
"very good food. we always take the vegetarian menu. we never can eat dessert because we are so full. the food is great, fresh and smells wonderfu "
we are visiting leeuwarden for a shorter period and have had our late dinner twice from this place. both times we have been very satisfied. only done the take away part but been well happy both times.
a really hidden jewel of a restaurant! cheap but very delicious and tasty food! although the restaurant interior is somewhat tired this is fantastic value for money!
"third time to jamuna and this time slightly disappolinted, mainly due to the service. long wait for menus, to order drinks, for them to arrive, to order food and even longer wait for it to arrive. ok, it was a friday evening at 7pm and the restaurant was full, but theres a simple answer...get more staff if you cant cope!! another thing, i had booked a table for six which wasnt ready for us.... anyway, when my eventually food arrived it was pretty good. as always i chose two veggie side dishes, masoor dal and chana masala, with rice and an onion nan. the dal was a good consistency and nice and garlicy, the chana masala pleasantly spicy. the dissappointment was the onion nan. it was obviously factory made and looked like the ones you can buy at the supermarket."
"we just landed here for a quick dinner, and as it had 4 stars we decided to give it a  "
"i have been having dinner on jamuna several times over the years. i believe that the first time was back in year 2000 and when i am in town, this is one of the places i will return to. the food has never been disappointing, tonight i got murgh madras which in this restaurant is spicy. i once tried the vindaloo version and that was really hot. the menu card will warn you - as will the staff! if you are in town and if you like indian food, then this place is worth a visit. it has been in business for at least 12+ years so that speaks for itself i guess."
"i went to jamuna with colleagues several times and was always satisfied. once i took people from india, who told me they also liked the food and thought it was prepared very similar to the way it would have been at their homes. i suggest you order several dishes to share at the table."
"we had a lovely dinner at this restaurant. the setting is average and masks the fact that this is a quality restaurant. the staff is very friendly and helpful. once we got the food we loved it. great choice and everything we ordered was delicious but boy did we have to wait long for it! that would be the only reason dor us not to return with our 10 year old. if you like a long evening in a restaurant, this is the place ro be!"
we always treat ourselves to a meal here when we are in the neighbourhood. the food is very good and reasonably priced. we would recommend reserving a table as the restaurant is usually quite full. tel. 058 213 14 35. it is closed on mondays. open from 17.00-22.00 and also offers take-aways.
i think there should be many more indian restaurants in holland as it really is a treat! jumana has a good choice of food for everyone at very reasonable prices. the staff are friendly sometimes a little slow but i think the staff change quite often as i have never seen the same people there twice (apart from the managers.) i would defiantly recommend this restaurant as its truly delicious and a great way to end a nice day of shopping in leeuwarden.(the chicken pure as a starter is amazing and i enjoy the tikka masala as a main course it has a nice bite of chilli to it) all dishes come with rice but you can order potatoes and nan bread with it also.
"indian food is not as well known in nl as it is in the uk. in leeuwarden the jamuna offers a good introduction. well balanced flavours, and spicy enough for any taste."
"with our children we frequently enjoy their vegetarian tali. the food is of a very high quality, the service is great en the price is low for what you get. the restaurant is popular, so its wise to make a reservation if you are with a group. highly recommended, also for vegetarians."
"we got ourselves the meatball, unfortunately they did not have the lowcarb bread. however, the lunch was very tasty and the home made meatball with gravy and crispy bacon tasted delicious. service with a smile, even the cook brought the plates in herself and again appologized for not having the requeted lowcarb bread. when visiting leeuwarden, we will surely get another dish from the menu!"
great food and really fast and friendly service. we recommend it to anyone looking for a place to have a nice lunch and we‚Äôll come back for sure next time we are in leeuwarden.
"they serve a good lunch, much choise and friendly, efficient service. i went for beef croquettes and my wife ordered a snack plate. good quality and a pleasant plce to go."
amazing food local produced and sustainable and the people who works there are super nice :d we had the carpaccio and the healthy sandwich.... yummy üòã  sorry i just remembered i should have take photo once i finished the food üòõ

"whether you want a decent coffee, a cool drink or a nice lunch, this is the place to be. situated in one of the most picturesque shopping streets in leeuwarden, (currently cultural capital of europe 2018) it offers a friendly atmosphere that appeals to young and old. quality of everyting they serve is excellent, and staff is very friendly. most welcoming."
great to see so much attention in everything. its clear these guys are passionate for food. love this place. we will return here soon.
we were here for an quick bite before we headed off on our tour of leeuwarden. had good tasty food (vegetarian options as well) which was well presented and filling. the guys at the restaurant were extremely helpful - they clearly had a good taste for beer with an excellent collection and made a very good recommendation for o 
wonder full cafe   that speaks english   wholesome snacks serving a range of fortified coffees  and beers
barrevoets is managed by two young guys that spell hospitality with a capital  
"this is a small but very cosy place. it does not matter if you only want a coffee or you want to eat something, they offer various options! it is very nice that in the menu you can see if a dish has som alergenic ingredients (soya, milk, eggs, gluten, dairy...). the staff is very friendly and willingto help, reccomend something to eat or to visit. i had something like a hamburger (it had amsterdam in the title) because it was a reccomendation and it was wonderful. coffee is great also!"
"ive entered the barrevoets and was warmly welcomed in by a lovely lady. eventhough she barrels spoke english she waitressed my and guided me through the dutch menu. i was ging to visite some otter planes blut felt so cosy there, that ive spendt hours there drinking and eating. in you visite leeuwarden go to the barrevoets. its worte it!"
"located in an street filled with interesting little shops. barrevoets is a great place for coffee and a healthy bite. the service is really good. for the boys and girls who like a good beer. this is also the place for you, and if you are lucky they will tell you the story behind that pacific beer your drinking . or just ask ;)"
"went here for an early lunch on a saturday.  was quite nice.  had two sandwiches, of which one was the dutch specialty raw beef. would come back."
"happened to wander in to taste the dutch fries with a mayo dip, popular in the netherlands. the fries were cooked to order and very tasty! some places told me they fry in pork fat, so you might ask if you care."
"went to the place with a friend of mine on a relaxing afternoon and was more than happy that we chose that place ! very relaxing atmosphere, the guys working there were very friendly and they have great variety of tea and bio smoothies ! didnt try the cakes, but will definitely do next time:) "
"barrevoets is my piece of heaven in leeuwarden. the best homemade cakes i have tasted in leeuwarden, to die for smoothies and i highly recommend the wraps which comes with mouth watering homemade pesto. i appreciate that the food is fresh and one can taste the freshnes "
nice restaurant on the waters edge very pleasant and helpful staff we both had the pork loin with satay good choice .comfortable seats and pleasant location on the waterside. would definitely recommend
"eating outside at de koperen tuin is like taking a mini-break. surrounded by birds, huge trees and the sound of the fountain without any traffic going past is bliss. we had the flatbread with smoked salmon. yum! they also serve soy lattes and the coffee is excellent. "
we chose a sunny day so sat outside - the sound of the fountain softly splashing as we drank our queen g&ts with red fruit. just what the doctor ordered. the staff are very attentive and just want to make you happy. when we left they said they hoped we would be back soon. i will. my friend is heading to spain for at least a year but if she comes back to visit i bet it will be her number one location to catch up.
"great cake and coffee, good service and relaxed environment. first visit but will definitely not be our last."
staff very friendly ambiance very good location very good menu size good food portion good food quality average very affordable
we arrived in leeuwarden by boat and asked a few locals about good food for the 2 couples aboard and was recommended to de koperen tuin and was very pleased with the excellent quality of food and excellent service. i had the salmon with dill sauce and my wife had the beef stew along with a great vanilla chocolate dessert. highly recommend the restauaunt.
"with the nice weather on my daytrip to leeuwarden today i included a nice stroll in the citypark prinsentuin, where i stumbled upon this neat grand caf√© with a terrace, located on top of a little hill overlooking a pond with fountain and a small outdoor musicha "
before we visit the pubs for a evening with friends we started the evening with a fine diner at the koperen tuin. very good service en fine food. the price is right. they served fine wine and they have very good single malt wiskye.
the view and the tranquility makes this place a must... beautiful garden around with the river on the back.... good prices all around and amazing view to the pond!
"wonderful terrace, its flooded with light, theres things to see, the snack & beer menu is good, the local speciality beers are tasty, as are the crispy bitterballen with hot & sweet mustard. the staff is friendly and engaged and not at all pretentious. its a pleasure to go there after a visit to the museum."
"to enjoy a few drinks in the early evening i visited this new establishment housed within the zaailand mall building, by the museum and filmhuis arthouse cine "
great place to go for a cheap quick noodle based meal. eveything cooked fresh and lots of choice. its like a subway style selection process and then a choice of noodles.   well worth going and very well priced .
"went here for the first time with my friend and we loved the food. it was also fun to choose what we want for our bowl. although the portion was too big for us, its worth it! i tried the tokyo teriyaki sauce and will come back again to try the other sauces üòã"
lovely place to eat and menu easy to follow.  you can see all that is available on display.  very quick service and reasonable prices.  you can try chopsticks if you want!
i went to this wok for a cheap dinner during my visit to leeuwarden. they serve nice asian fast food with a friendly pri 
"great fresh food. the pom is delicious and the roti is very good, we tried the lamb (massala) and the stewed beef (soja sauce), it was a long time ago that i eat such nice surinam food, even in surinam. very friendly service. love it"
"our first ever taste of surinamese cuisine and it was a lovely surprise. quite spicy and made a nice change from the usual curries we tend to eat. we chose menu c, the chefs selection which gave us a taste of many different dishes. its a nice restaurant, friendly staff and pleasant decor. would love to eat there again."
"the boring snack is out, ken is in! lovely surinam food, and an owner that radiates passion for good food. i used the take-away twice now, and both plates were delicious in taste, and were kept warm nicely. another time we had dinner there. ambiance is not all great, with simple decorations. but then you expect something special from the food. not to worry! special wishes, spicy or plain, it is possible. you can really get a proper surinam meal for a friendly price."
this delightful little restaurant was highly spoken of by the owners of the b&b we were staying at in sneek. a little off the beaten track but with satellite navigation or town map it is not difficult to find and the effort is well rewarded by kens fabulous surinam cuisine. his son is a very friendly guy and speaks excellent english as does ken. the food is delicious and freshly cooked to order. highly recommended.
some might not be impressed by the no-frills interior but its very much the way i like it. i had the veggie roti with pumpkin & eggplant (aubergine) and its absolutely yum 
"if you are in for something different and dont mind a 5 minute walk from the famous sneek landmark de waterpoort in order to get genuine surinam food, which is made with all the love in the world, kens surinam eatcounter is the place you are looking for. all dishes freshly cooked, so they may take some time, but absolutely delicious and the portion size is overwhelming. really genuine surinam kitchen, with all the multi- culti influences incorporated in the dish "

"great place for coffee or lunch. very friendly service, good food, lovely decoration, nicely located."
"very creative sandwich with chicken, bacon, pesto, mayo and curry. hand crafted while you wait. i did take away, but it would have been great for a sit down lunch too."
"by chance we found an excellent coffee-restaurant/bar. they serve an excellent espresso, first class, good on temperatue, and great taste. well done and worthwhile to visit and drink at least one double espresso,"
"the food is good, flexibel sraff, nice and concerned/interested. the price is not too high. good and free parking place"
"we checked into the stayok hostel and came straight here, as it is next door.  the food was good and plentiful, although i would have liked more vegetables with it.  the restaurant has a lovely view, especially in the evening"
"this is the place to be if you are into real chinese cuisine (not westernized) with authentic flavours and combinations. interesting not every-day chinese dishes at very good quality/price ratio. restaurant is situated on the waterfront of the city of sneek, houkesloot, where in summer season you see all types of boats coming from or going to the sneeker meer. wonderful place for chinese dinner."
"since a few weeks, aqua village is working with a new concept, all u can eat sushi and japanese kitchen! this is more than worthy of sharing because the taste, ambiance by the water, caring and attentive waitresses and fresh made sushi is excellent! the presentation, taste and care for food is visible in each dish presented! next to the new japanese kitchen, cantonese and asian kitchen menu is delightful and worth for a visit! a great dinner and worthy for a return with my friends!"
"despite of being alone i had no problem to order a menu which is normally for two. great meal thoroughly enjoyed it. it is a slow eating experience, but definately worth the wait."
"fantastic authentic indonesian food. best rijsttafel i had in ages.  very frindly staf, great wine selection too. great quality price relationship"
"we had a wonderful meal here last night with a friend from out of town. the food was very good, staff professional and friendly and the portions were generou "
enormous variety of dishes. everything was tasty and worth its price. the staff was in a good mood and very friendly. looking forward to come over again üëã
"excellent service and the staff were very friendly. the food was fantastic, very delicious and extremely tasty. i highly recommend this restaurant."
"when in sneek and you would like some delicious indonesian food, make sure you visit klein java. various rijsttafel choices. friendly and helpful service. we all loved it."
we enjoyed a jakarta rijsttafel which was amazing! the sheer amount of dishes was surprising and all were very tasty. staff could be slightly more attentive to the needs of the customers as we were ignored a number of times when looking for some more drinks. its recommended to book as this place gets packed!
"we are lovers of indonesian food. the bandung rijsttafel was excellent prepared, nice serving and very tasteful."
it was the first time i ate indonesian food and i liked it. i already knew the thai food but i found just some similarities and especially a reduced use of spic 
we did enjoy a nice and cosy atmosphere with kind personnel and nice food. is a place where for sure i will come back.
"have been coming here for years. so good! the staff is friendly, the food is excellent and the price is good. klein java is officially one of the 50 best indonesian restaurants in the netherlands."
fabulous! my mother-in-law speaks malais with the staff. incredible food!  one of our family favorites!   enak betul!  terimah kasih banjak :-)
having tried the best rated indonesian restaurant in amsterdam and being rather disappointed we decided to try our luck again this time in sneek. a great decisi 
"we love the indonesian-eastern cuisine, and the restaurant klein java did not disappoint us. all dishes were very good, plentiful, scents and tastes amazing, just like we wanted!"
"on the way from arnhem to drachten, via boat. food was great, with a great variety of flavour. there was also a great service."
this restaurant has been in this location for many years and well established.  they are proud to use the authentic way of cooking with only fresh and original ingredients.  well advised to pay a visit!
"its saturday night and we left our riverboat cruise in sneek, friesland, northern netherlands, in search of either a pancake house or an indonesian restaurant with "
"visited this restaurant with a group of 5 and having lived 10 years in indonesia,i was hoping for authentic flavours. they did not let me down. obviously the spicy dishes were not as spicy as they should be, but i expect that when catering to the general european taste that would be unavoidable. personally i prefer more spice. service was on the slow side, which i actually prefer but if youre in a hurry, this may not be your best choice. i suggest being patient, relax and enjoy. nothing in the indonesian culture is ever fast so this is again authentic  "
"judging from all the good reviews we visited klein java with 3 people. we chose the rice table bandung, with meat and 3 types of satay. it took a while before the dishes came. as a starter were given a small indian loempia: delicious to taste. on the menu is indicated that you should be in a hurry at klein java, because many dishes are freshly prepared and that takes time. the dishes we‚Äôd chosen were great!! tasty seasoned meat, from sweet to spicy and very spicy. delicious gado-gado, the satay-types tasted perfect. highly recommended. very nice is that small java on request serves a bottle of ordinary tap water without costs. in our view, far too little restaurants offer that service. in addition to the delicious food klein java has fair prices: with a drink beforehand and the said rice table for 3 people we paid just over 70 euros. compliments!"
very good food! all ingredients are fresh!! this is worth to visit more than once! personal attention and the best chicken soup ( soto ajam) ever.
"delicious, delicately flavoured dishes. friendly staff. not pricy. the culinary highlight of our visit to friesland."
"we came with six people without reservation and they made it possible that we can sit together. the recommendation was a rice platter which we ordered. they brought 12 different dishes with lamb, chicken, fish and vegetarian. beside this salad, two different kind of rice and before a yummy starter. everyone of us had enough and they even asked to bring more. the food tasted excellent. absolutely recommendable!"
"the only true indonesian restaurant in friesland. superb food, all freshly made, so you have to wait sometimes but it is worth wile. kind and nice service. recommended."
"probably the most affordable restaurant in sneek. you can have dinner a la carte or choose the buffett. a varied choice, even if you are a vegetarian. there is a mix of chinese/indonesian cuisine. the portions were very good, and it was not overpriced, in comparison with others."
"i actually just wanted to post some pictures to give everyone a better impression of the restaurant, but id have to say that i like the food a lot and for me the servings are more than sufficient. if you are in for trying something new or the restaurants best dishes, id definitely recommend you to order one of the specialties or ask the waiter to suggest somethin "
"the all inclusive includes drinks and that includes wine and beer which are usually expensive items. if you drink less than a couple of beers or wines the price per person will seem high, if it‚Äôs a ‚Äòmerry‚Äô evening then it could be great value! good selection of starters and lots of sweet things too, main courses are supplemented by buffet with wok cooked make it up yourself dishes the central item(s). good even impressive decor and friendly service make for a good visit"
"also known as the wok restaurant, the jasmine garden is excellent. a huge choice of dishes already laid out on the buffet or freshly cooked. choose the ingredients... meat, fish or vegetables, take the plateful to the hot grill chef or the stir fry chef and he will cook it there and then, adding sauces of your choice. the ready cooked buffet is nice but the hot grill and stir fry options are better. highly recommended."
"i would recommend this place its very well priced the food is good its not expensive, the is a very good selection of food and drink i would definitely recommend trying this place out wether it be just to relax or have something good to eat, i will try this place again i enjoyed it , it was nice how there was an english menu aswell"
"went to ‚Äòt zusje in apeldoorn. i have visited other locations of ‚Äòt zusje, but never in apeldoorn before. the restaurant looks nice and cozy and the food is as good as in any other ‚Äòt zusje restauran "
we went with 6 of us and we all enjoyed the different dishes. you can order as much as you wa 
very delicious small portions of suprising dishes. nice and helpfull staff. the hard part is what too choice first
"based on the idea of ‚Äòdo not waste food‚Äô, they offer small dishes. therefor you order multiple small dishes for every round. the menu has different and several options and offers good choices. the restaurant people are very friendly and helpfull."
"for my birthday we decided to order in, instead of going out. we paid what you would expect bland got a great choice of foods and sauces and rice. it was all very tasteful and delivered exactly on time. it was many years we at india food and now we remember how much we missed those tremendous tastes!"
"my partner and i visited here with our baby and we had a lovely time. they moved us to a bigger table so we had more room and were very accommodating. delicious food, great vegan options and friendly service. would definitely return if we come back to the area."
"we came on a sunday evening, we enjoyed the ambiance from the inside but outside would have been a great option too. but anyway we had a nice experience. their curries are very good of taste and the fish tikka was very good too. we ordered a buttered chapati with it and the dishes came with a big portion of rice. small portion of pappadums are served as a complimentary starter. service is good but nothing special. the food however is quite close to fabulous. great rich taste, well served on hot-staying plates and big enough. we had to had some courage finishing it all, but we managed. left with a full stomach of indian cuisine."
excellent restaurant  saturday night exceptionally busy one of the best indians i have visited during my 35 years in the netherlands great menu choice friendly staff great value for money classic dishes with a twist

amazing indian food in netherlands.. 
"we had pappadams first with three sauces, one was like chutney,, not sure about the other two. not a good start. samosa was good for entree. mains were excellent. desert also very good for the four chosen. reasonable australian red served with the meal. average prices for great food."
arrived late and were greeted warmly and had excellent and fast service and every need catered to. food was excellent and so was everything else.
"the india palace restaurant is in the centre of apeldoorn and is what i would describe as posh. crisp tablecloths, tall wine glasses on the table draped with napkins, that sort of thin "
what impressed me the most is that the complaint of a guest (mine) was taken serious. a business that listens to its customers is one that will succee 
"i have been there as an solo traveler and with my non-indian office colleagues. all the time , the experience has been truly awesome . very good food- as close to having something in india. , nicely packed for the to go orders. everyone should absolutely be to this restaurant to experience it .!"
this is a best place for authentic indian food at genuine price with so much of variety. a must visit for everyone.
"i have tried almost every dish at india palace. if you ask me which one is my favorite, ill say, every dish. they have the best collection of indian curries. ive always enjoyed having meal at this place, especially their special india palace thali. and yes, dont forget to try their mango lassi and mango liqu "
"india palace has truly been my home abroad serving the finest indian cuisine.. i am so very fond of their chicken madras, biriyani and dal tadka. and will certainly recommend this place to anyone who wants to give the best to their tastebuds. i have taken several of my dutch friends to this place and theyve been suggesting that we visit over again !!"
i have been there in apeldoorn for a month and almost daily visited to india place restaurant. i have never felt like i am out of india. they are nice people and so food. whether you are indian or not you should try their food once.
"real good food, really nice service. we had a splendid meal, quick and more then enough.  great place to be. not very big but a nice location in center of town.  we will come back!"
good selection of traditional curry dishes. cater well if youre looking for something with some good spice like is served in the uk. accurate and fast service.
great service and food was first class. prices are reasonable and portions are good. nice selection of beers and i would definitely return.
"food was very good (dal soup and vegetarian dishes). also special beer availible . friendly service. not very cheap, but also not very expensive."
last day was very remarkable day for ate  delicious food with my friends at india place restaurant. specially india place special menu and vegetarian food. this food was very testy.they provide good hospitality and fast service. its really very testy food.                  recommended
"the owner moved from a small location to this one wich is much bigger, serving good food. friendly staff."
"great food & drinks. lovely place in the center of apeldoorn. stylish interior with committed and friendly staff. my go to place for lunch or, later on the day, a glass of great wine from their excellent collection."
we just passed this small lunchroom and it looked so inviting. the service is perfect and of course also their coffee and sandwiches. the owner explained very well about the different tastes of the coffeebeans. next time well stop there again.
the owner of rembrandt is very friendly and knows what he is talking about. this place is perfect for a simple lunch or having some drinks in the afternoon (they have great wines).
"tapas as much as you can eat for a fixed price, with a lovely mochito and nice cuban music, what more can you want! meat, fish, vegan, cold tapas, i will be back for sure."
"we, a friend of mine and myself, went to la cubanita on a sunday evening to try out the restaurant for the first time. it was very busy and we were glad that we reserved a table upfron "
"on a recent business trip, we struggled to find an open restaurant so came across la cubanita by accident. thank goodness! what a really nice experien "
"went here many times with friends and always recommend this place. if you like latin cuban style music and feeling, you are def in the right place. its very cozy and cute, great vibe and the food is good. too bad the all you can eat tapas is not in the weekend, but over all great! lots of choice in tapas and everything tastes good! always very busy, so youll have to make reservations."
we had dinner in la cubanita apeldoorn for the first time and we were satisfied. the tapas are good and the atmosphere is great: its a colourful place with matching music. the staff is attentive and friendly. one major point though is that the toilets were very dirty and are obviously not regularly cleaned. 
"as soon as you enter this restaurant you see the -of course- cuban influence; photos of cuban street life, che guevara and so... its fun that as a guest you are allowed to write messages on the wall "

"good food good service, great atmosphere, and not too expensive, would definately go back again. also parking available behind restaurant."
"we had a very nice dinner in the terrace.  food was great and service excellent and friendly. goof value for money. we had oysters and salmon, both perfectly cooked.  we will go back again."
this restaurant has been on our list for ages and so it happens that we finally booked a table he 
"very good food, amazing athmosphere. owners all the time talking care about guests. nice wine, so delicious starter and main course."
"poppe is an excellent restaurant. it can get quite busy, so best to reserve. the menu is good, although for vegetarians and people who dont enjoy uncooked meant/fish the choice is not extensive. the food is really lovely and well presented. the service is friendly and attentive. there is an excellent selection of wines if you are prepared to pay for it. there is (limited) parking behind the restaurant and a nice garden when the weather is suitable for al fresco dining. its also very good for lunch as well as dinner."
a great place with excellent food and great service. with the surprise menu definitely the pace to go
"i ordered the tuna dish as my starter. it was serve thinly cut with a asian soy sauce base. while the sauce was a perfect companion of the tuna as it did not overpower the delicate taste of it. for my main entree ordered the sea bass in a tomato base sauce with a basil aioli. fish was perfectly cook, moist and tender, sauces complemented well the delicate flavor of the fish. for dessert i ordered the chocolate dessert with ice cream, nothing out of the ordinary, maybe i was expecting more after having the tuna and sea bass."
"i use to dinner several times a year with different friends at poppe. this is in part to due the geographical location of apeldoorn as each of us comes from another part of the country, but this is mainly due to the good kitchen and fine wines, the friendly staff and the pleasant atmosphere. after an interesting lecture in the nearby synagogue there, this time i came with my wife. as usual, we had an enjoyable evening."
"we had the 3course set menu which was a delight. the staff very fery attentive. they accomodate our request to start outside then move inside. if i lived in apeldoorn, we would be regulars."
"upon entering , you look right into the kitchen of restaurant poppe . although we were early for lunch , there were already four chefs busy to prepare fresh fo "
"it was only by chance that we came across poppe for lunch and what a delightful venue this really is. we had a lovely set 3 course meal which was superb value for 25 euros. the service was relaxed & unrushed, which is a rarity in this day and age. our waitress was lovely & helpful and even explained all of the courses (in english) in detail to me. the complimentary bread & olives were a real nice touch. the place itself has a nice cosy atmosphere and the rest rooms are modern & clean. highly recommended indeed."
"our plan was to have dinner next door at martins, but after being seated and then ignored for 10 mins we left and went next door. a very good decision. we were quickly given a table and our drinks order was taken. when the waiter realised that i was not dutch he switched to english and bought me an english menu. the food was excellent. i ordered the goats cheese with mango chutney and the salmon in puff pastry with a lemon grass sauce both delicious. my only complaint is that there was not enough of the lemongrass sauce, but that is a small complaint as the salmon was beautifully moist and delicious on its own. my husband ordered the oysters and then the sole, both were very tasty and cooked to perfecti "
"never been to a vietnamese restaurant, but this buffet restaurant offers lovely vietnamese dishes, specialities from the grill and great service aswe "
"friendly reception, traditional food, though, it is adapted to local taste. if you know how to find your way, you ignore the buffet and go to the (lady-)staffed kitchen in the right-back corner. light, fresh and sizzeling."
went here with family who had been before and really enjoyed the food there. ate a variety of dishes and there wasnt anything i did not like from the main foods available. i did not try everything though so i have a reason to go back and eat there again. 
"we had dinner with friends here. before dinner we played dutch billiards and had a drink. people are extremely kind and helpful. we decided to stay for dinner which was good. nothing fancy, but is is a bar, right? excellent place for a drink and a bite after hiking in the surrounding area! "
at cafe de hamer you can enjoy your drinks and meal at the large terrace. they do not make reservations and it is always busy but you dont have to wait too long for a table. very friendly staff and good food.
"situated near royal palace on the way to vaassen, you will find this very local meeting point to have a drink or a pub meal. in summer time with possibility to sit outside in the garden."
"this local cafe just outside apeldoorn is not cozy, its not comfortable, its just gezellig. :) this is typically dutch word. it describes a mood, a feeling. just go and found out yoursel "
"we went here around dinner time on a friday night. the place was packed to the roof. all sorts of different types mingling which i found very interesting. many just come for a drink, and others eat. tables are hard to get, so you have to be lucky. the food is generous and of good quality but i wouldnt call it fine dining...it is more bar/bistro kind of fare. the kitchen closes early, i thought around 9 or so, so dont be late. service was very friendly despite it being so busy. overall, a fun place to go, watch people and enjoy the crowd."
"we are in town for a couple of weeks and our hotel does not have suites with kitchens so we are eating out much more than we prefer. that being said, we found cafe de hamer last night and we were very impressed!! i had the chicken salad and it was one of the best salads i have had in a very long time!! we will be going back to try more items tonight. another great thing is it is open all day. we had a busy morning so didnt make it there until 3pm and there was no break in the kitchen staff. we were served as soon as we walked in."
"i walked by this place a few times , decided to go in and give it a try , i liked the menu selection especially the wine list , the location is so good as well, sat out side as it was warm , id recommend the steak tartar i enjoyed that the most with red wine üç∑ "

i had eaten at martins some time ago and was pleasantly surprised how much it has improved. the menu was rather carnivore-centric but there are now vegetarian and vegan dishes on the menu. what pleased me the most is the excellent selection of wines; actually there are very nice wines available for a very reasonable pri 
was not the first time that we visited martins we were lucky enough to eat from the renewed menu which included a tuna specialty that well cooked that exceeded expectations.
"ever since i can remember, martins is an icon in apeldoorn. lunch, dinner, brunch, high tea or high wine... they keep re-inventing themselves and always serve quality food. you can be sure theres always plenty of food on your plate, whatever dish you choose. superb wine choice, even by the glass. good ambiance, nice people."
"on several occasions my friend and i ate at martins before we seeing a movie. martins is situated at the hart of apeldoorn, the shops, the cinema and the theatre are a few minutes walking distance. the staff is young and friendly and the food is great."
martins brasserie is a nice place in the center of apeldoorn .with in summer a terras in the front off the building and one in the garden at the back. the food and wines are well chosen .and the card is easy to chose from.
"i have had lunch and dinner here on several occasions and it was always good, although i prefer having lunch here. they have enough things to choose from, although the 12-uurtje is my favorite. its a plate with a small glass of fresh tomato soup, a mini-bread with egg-salad and a breadroll with kroket (typical dutch). they have an awesome fresh mint-tea with honey. i took my handicapped mom there for lunch on my birthday and even though we had to ask several people to move, we could get in with her wheelchai "
i had a simple lunch with a friend in this brasserie in the center of apeldoorn. the food is good and well prepared.
weve stumbled upon this little gem just before the holidays. we went inside and the place was pack 
"potjandorie in the north part of apeldoorn (walking distance from palace t loo) offers a wide variety of entries (eur 7,50) and mains (eur 20,50). the mains are stoves with meat (chicken, pork, beef, fish) and some vegetarian offerings. additional they offer a free amuse and some bread. also a salad from the salad bar is included. salads are well tasty. the service is ok. quality of the food is good, however the pork (varkenshaas) was leathery, unfortunately. hot served which is perfect. it took quite a long time before getting the food, so dont go for a quick meal. a restaurant worth a visit."
superleckeres essen... we recommend the gezonde pot quinoa and the spareribs... very friendly staff. cosy little restaurant.
"very well situated at the beginning of the park and close to things like the apenheul this is a nice place to sit and eat something, especially on a nice day when you can sit out on the deck overlooking the park."
food was excellent! the ambiance perfect!  the is an outdoor patio overlooking the lake with a huge fountain! just beautiful!
family dinner.  food and service was great.  3 course dinner was really enjoyable. great setting as well.
"the food is great and the prices are pretty good. chef dirk knows his stuff!  great atmosphere! also for meetings and weddings, the location is amazing!!"
"this brent new restaurant is situated near a beautifull pont and a lovely nature park. you can take nice walks in the park or just sit and relax. nearby there is also a zoo, called apenheul. there you can walk among all kind of free roming monkeys."
"this is a great place to sit outside for food and drink when the weather is nice. the terrace has a lovely view over a lake. the food is pretty good, although we tend to prefer it for lunch or snacks."
"we had a quick lunch outside on the terrace overlooking the large fishpond. the service was friendly, the food was good, offering vegetarian options."
this restaurant is situated in a beautiful park with a wonderful pond. after a walk it is good to a break for a drink and a meal. nice and professional service staff. quality of food is good.
"we arrived in apeldoorn to visit family and went for a walk around the park, stopping at the restaurant for lunch. it was a damp day and the restaurant was very inviting. the food was both good and plentiful and everyone enjoyed their meal in a warm and friendly environme "
"nice locaion with good view over the area outside, inside and from the terrace at good weather. combination with meeting rooms offers good possibilities for pleasant group meetings in a relaxed atmosphere"
pleasant location on the lake before or after visiting apenheul.  basic food and drink.  seating is in or outdoors - best outside if you can.
"me and my so had a very nice dinner in this restaurant. the layout of the restaurant is spacious, almost too spacious. if you want to have a private conversation, this is the place to go. the view from the dining area on the big pond of the park is very beautiful. it would be nice if the lights were on in the evening. during summer evenings it must be very nice to sit and eat outside on the terrac "
"you must go. in a small pretty netherlands town. a great local feel. part pub, part restaurant. tucked away. staff great and very helpful. food out of this world and served hot - temperature. beer selection great. local dutch people friendly. decor and atmosphere brilliant. great value. thanks for all there. hope to pop by again "
this small bar - restaurant has seatings in the back. its not a big place but more pub style if you like. the atmosphere is easy going and a lot of locals get to this place to have a drink or relax and some even after work to shoot some pool with beer and snac 
"this place a is a typical dutch bar/restaurant. the people, food and guests are just great. defo on my list every time i come to apeldoorn"

"you always get a very warm welcome when entering herberg het oude loo. the food menu is excellent and varied with some nice specials to choose from. duncan, femke and the staff are always very attentive."
really awesome dinner experience. well worth the time and expense and in a beautiful setting.  it is gourment food.
"we had a marvelous experience with the 6 course menu of the season. everything was beautifully served and everything tasted great. special compliments for the creative dishes such as the yellowfin kingfish sashimi ensemble. a wonderful wine pairing, a beautiful ambiance and outstanding service made it a perfect experience."
"my husband and i spent 5 days in the hotel and decided to try their gastronomic restaurant, we really enjoyed the experience! because when we go to this kind of restaurant, each time it is a different ‚Äúexperience‚Äù, one has to be aware that it needs a bit a patience because the dishes are extremely refined, require time and skills to get prepared, what is more the waiting is really nice since the atmosphere, the amuse-bouches, the service make it perfe "
"many years ago i visited this place on the occasion of an anniversary meal with my grandmother. the place burnt down , hence a brand new hotel annex restaurant. the welcome was exemplary attentive and energetic. the modern building runs the risk that you lose some authenticity but service makes it up. the diner we had was fine, but not exceptional. true they had pigeon, deer and all nature offers, which was good but not world-class. the room (well suite) was really superb. the shower (one tab 2 waterjets ) was great. this is a really fine place to stay. breakfast is average, but good. all in all, nice place, and you will feel welcome here"
"i could go into detail, but i think its enough to say that this food compares with all of my michelin star experiences. truly gastronomy the fact that game is the feature on the menu only adds greater attraction to my tastes; however, my wife was absolutely thrilled by the fish of the evening and the vegetables. the meal itself was underlined with fresh ingredients and spirits of tastes that challenged your palate but never overwhelmed. dishes would contain both elements that were both cool to the mouth and next to it something perfectly warmed and in between would be a foam or a glaze that would bring both elements together. what im trying to say is that a meal here is an experience and it will not disappoint. the wine list is extensive and has many reasonable finds with a lien toward french varietals. the thought of a pre-drink or an afgter-dinner drink is easily met with a deep bar, including a variety of regional beers. im not necessarily a beer drinker, but when in rome...the pair that i had were unique and delicious. and if anyone has a taste for bubbles, they serve veuve clicquot by the glass (and bottle) in the black topped bottle. delicious and reasonable. i cant wait to come back to explore the menu further."
"in the middle of the green woods of dutch nature area ‚Äòde veluwe‚Äô, the intimate hotel de echoput is located. we were given the opportunity to experience this hotel by having a very well-organized stay here while getting to utilize the facilities of this place such as the (grand) fitness area, the swimming pool and sauna. thanks to the calming environment, the great facilities and the attentive and hardworking personnel, we had an amazing stay at hotel de echop "
"my husband and i were spending the weekend exploring around arnhem and the veluwe, so it was somewhat of a last minute idea to enjoy lunch here (booking a table after we had already left home). consequently we felt a bit underdressed but we were still made to feel very welcome. the food was delicious and showed how good ingredients can be combined in amazing ways that really excited the palate. the learning came from the excellent wine pairing - i wouldn‚Äôt usually have a white wine with lamb but it was excellent. dessert was lovely, although it was a shame that the souffl√© was not available. this is not a restaurant that just churns out food though, so occasional sellouts are to be expected. we will definitely try to come back for an evening meal and maybe an overnight stay..."
"situated in the forest, this hotel is the perfect get a way from the city. during our stay we have encountered very friendly and well trained staff. the high level of service has made our stay very comfortable. the 5 course diner that was served was very tasty, even though a sauce was missing at one of the plates, the service team corrected this flawlessly. definitely recommend to stay there!"
"booked table for two at 19.30. the first and the second menu was excellent. the main course was served at 22.00 which is rather late. i could not enjoy my dish anymore because i was starving. when it comes to the dessert, i was not in the mood anymore because i want it to end. it is pity that first excellent impression is ruined by lack of time managemen "
"we had a tasting of wines like hermitage and less. after we had a lunch, very good!!!! in the evening wild eating in the brasserie, all right"
"very good restaurant (and hotel). we had an excellent 3 course-menu. rather small but delicious portions, overall quit enough for a good meal that was definitely worth the price. the service was extremely friendly and informative without being pushy. only (but quit annoying) remark was the horrible timing as we spent almost 4 hours for 3 courses. the planning took way too long to be acceptable, if not for that this would have been one of our top-5 restaurant experiences of thus year (but still top 10!)"
"last year we spent one evening at restaurant de echoput and the experience was so good that we wanted to explore this gastronomic temple more extensively.so we booked a 4-days 5-courses gastronomic arrangement. we had not a single major disappointment and in those four days every course was new, a performance ! on top of that the restaurant and the staff offer a rarechic friendly, polite and efficient servi "

"we visited the restaurant of hotel de echoput on a sunny,warm evening after booking online. upon arrival we were met by a distinguished young lady who was already informed about our horror for garlic. she escorted us to a nicely set table outside and proposed the surprise menu. the surprise was not very big as it was almost completely the proposed evening menu. nevertheless the courses were of outstanding quality and intriguing. a special visual effect of serving vegetables in a charcoaled cabbage on live charcoal was nice and fortunately the game served was as nice as the frills.the show part reminded me of el bulli.i had to drive 20 miles back to our hotel and intoxicated driving is not in my ethics. the young lady -i would not be doing justice calling her a waitress- proposed a small half glass of pairing wine,something i have not experienced elsewhere. in conclusion: the menu is very close to a michelin star if not above. reception and table service were flawless and the price was not that much above the normal eatery. adjacent to the restaurant one will find a small shop with local delicacies, cigars and win "

"for my wife‚Äôs birthday we decided to drive to apeldoorn and try the specialty ‚Äúgame‚Äù menu at the ‚Äúechoput‚Äù restaurant. we learned they serve ‚Äúin season‚Äù game all year round. they make it their mission statement to bring pure game and its pure flavor to the table. as we were a little early we were escorted to the fireplace for an aperitif. in the fire place there were some smoldering blocks of wood but not a real fire, so i took the liberty to rearrange the woodblock and put some small ones in between and within minutes we were looking at a roaring fi "

"me and my girlfriend stayed at the keizerskroon which king street restaurant is part of. it was a great ambiance in a luxury setting. we arrived late, around 9, but the waitress was still friendly and was happy to serve us a 4 course dinner even when the regular closing time of the kitchen was 9:30 pm. the food was really delicious, full of flavour, great texture and well plated. the wine served was very well. some of the were more complimentary to the dishes than others. overall, a great experience. well worth your bucks even though its on the finer end of dining."
the staff were amazing! they reassured me when i requested a gluten free option to the 2 course set menu and were so polite and friendly. i really felt welcome in a country that i have never been to before. the food was excellent and the decor extravagant. i really enjoyed dining here and will be back every night during my stay!
we dined at the restaurant during our stay at the bilderberg hotel. we ordered the set menus and were pleasantly surprised with the presentation and taste of the food that came out of the kitchen and overall friendliness of the staff. the sets were a combination of meat and seafood dishes garnished with the quality local produce. delicious.
nicely cooked fish and meat dishes. good wine. service was friendly and the waitress was experienced and professional. the waiter smelled like cigarette smoke following his break. overall the restaurant was a bit expensive but tasty. 
"great food, especially the meats on the grill. friendly service. some tables are too close to each other."
good restaurant which was in the hotel where we stayed. the only downside was the fact that we had a couple next to us who was really listening to us almost all evening. if the tables would have been a little further apart (or if we would have had different neighbours) it would have been perfect. the 4 out of 5 score is not affected by this.
"after reading reviews online i decided to eat here as i was staying in the hotel and i have to say it didnt disappoint. the food was amazing and full of flavor, the waiter who was serving our table was great and was so helpful with us as we were looking for recommendatio "
"we went to dinner here after the uci world track cycling and it was lovely. service was very attentive and the food beautifully presented and delicious. the prices are higher than normal so not an everyday experience, but a treat. when we were there it was quiet. the decor is modern and has a feeling of luxury about it. i would not suggest children go there as i have no idea if they could accommodate them, but it seems more an adult experience."

"we ate at king street restaurant last night with my european team. anouk, a young student took care of our table and it was a real treat. i rarely saw someone who had so much fun doing his job but above all, doing everything for his clients to have an excellent evening. the beautiful story of the evening was that in my team, there are english, italians, russians and french people. at the end of the evening, anouck took the time to write us a small postcard telling us that she had also had a good evening taking care of our table, in the different languages spoken by my team. it was super cool !!! i wish anouk the best for his future care "
"very good restaurant as for hotel standards. good choice of top fresh modern food, nice wine choice and excelnt service"
surprisingly for a hotel restaurant a good combination of quality and service. mains are either from the grill or slow cooked. setting is quite intimate. if you are staying in the hotel  an easy and tasty choice.
"the restaurant deserves the michelin star that owns. i can honestly say that it is one of the best restaurants in netherlands. the taste is so delicate and innovative that make the restaurant unique. we have had a delicious duck terrine, a crab soup and the most amazing pork wangs that i have ever tasted. "
"food is excellent, staff is extremely friendly, rooms are big, but a little bit dated. stayed for two nights. breakfast is very good. will visit again for sure."
excellent fish and dessert. nice service and good quality wines. especially sparkling wine was good. good value for money
"excellent meal, food was well presented, cooked perfectly and served with a smile. they offer a three course menu ( you choose your courses from the menu) servings are generous and tasty, the chef has an assured hand in cooking. we walked away very pleased and delighted to have dined in the hotel that evening."
"love the food here. its the best place to treat yourself. the food is tasty and staff is pretty good. great atmosphere. not to be over looked as what else you would look for going to a restaurant, amazing food and great service."
we enjoyed every minute in ramblas. the service and quality of food is great and the prices are absolutely moderate. a place to remember ‚ù§Ô∏è
"i went here for dinner , the food selection is good portions are generous and nice the price for the food and wine is very well worth the price , i went for the all u can eat i didnt run out of options and there was no time limit the food was very tasty too, i would recommend this place if u wanna enjoy some wine and flavourful food."
"we had a groupon voucher for this restaurant, so we booked  "
when you are a lover of spanish food then is this ramblas the most suitable place in apeldoorn. we took all kinds of cold and warm tapas and the quality was delicious. you also can choose for other food.

"we came with 8 kids , all found something to eat. the kids played until the food arrived. the food was tasty!!!"
"we had four different pizzas, each was delicious - basic and tasty, just the way a pizza should be. the kids loved their kids meal, even fries with ribs was an option. in short: great affordable place for a family meal."
"simple dishes but very testy and with very friendly atmospher. children can play till you wait for your portions and let you relax and rest after the trip.  they have discounted menus for children and regular including soup, mean course and dessert."
"we have come back many times, and each time we enjoy the atmosphere and the ordered food. service is very friendly and rather quick. the variety plentiful."
the location of this b&b is perfectly close to the center and close to the station. there is a bus stop right in front of the doo 
"we shared breakfast with our dutch family on our first morning in apeldoorn. we had a great spread with breads, conserves, coffee and egg. very reasonably priced."
this is a b&b located across the street from the central square. the central train station and the main shopping streets are an easy walk. palace het loo is a 20 minute bus ride and the kroller muller museum is a 35 minute bus ride away. the location is perfect - as is the large and comfortable rooms. the breakfast is five star quality. this is as good as a b&b can get!
a dutch flat pancake house.  big variety of savory and sweet monster crepes. just toooo delicious. glad we decided to stop driving by.  cousy atmosphere and family oriented.
a big surprise to find such a lovely place nearby at apeldoorn. also the pancakes. real professional piece of work. demands to go back !!!

"this a great place frequented by locals. you can get a menu in  english and the staff is very friendly and helpful. i had three in the pan which had bacon, cheese and apples. great dinner in apeldoorn!"
"went with some family upon the recommendation of some other family members and i was not disappointed. i had a pancake with bacon, cheese, goats cheese, pine nuts and honey and it was delicious. i could have happily eaten it again straight after."
we stopped at this restaurant during a visit to holla 
"after the apenheul we went to this pancake place. it is housed in a modern building on the edge of the center.. with a lot of parking places close by. the nice thing about this restaurant is that inside they have a lot of old attributes, it gives the pancake place a nice atmosphere and of course my grandchildren loved the pancakes and poffertjes. "
we love to eat pancakes and this restaurant is our favourite place for pancakes in apeldoor 
"went there because it was next to our hotel, what a nice surprise. the oysters were delicious, the ‚Äú quenelle de cabillaud ‚Äú too. the dry white wine advised matched marvelously and the coffee with treats was just fabulous and tasty. i would definitely recommend this restaurant , great food, great staff, great ambiance."
this year we decided to have our family christmas dinner with my 86 year old mother at de bon vivant in apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in an old house and has a lovely atmosphere. the serving staff were friendly and made sure that we were served in a timely manor. we went for the 5 course christmas dinner which was prepared very well.
"a very good kitchen and very sympathic personal, i had a coq au vin and  amour du chocolat, it was perfect."
"spend an evening here with some collegues, excellent food and friendly service. next to the theatre in case youre looking for  a pre theatre dinner"
this atmospheric restaurant is probably one of our answers if we want to have a nice dinner out. the place has two separated rooms where you can eat or go on stage where you have a nive overview over the restaura 
the service at this restaurant is excellent.  we had the set menu and all courses were delicious.  the food is mainly european. our table was outside which was very pleasant in the warm weather.
"we went not knowing anything about the restaurant and the food was gorgeous, service exemplary leisurely but not slow.  the bill was expensive but not outrageous and would definitely recommend.  no good for children as the flavours are more ‚Äúgrown up‚Äù."
we had a dinner at de bon vivant and that was really culinair experience. i ordered duck meat under the wine sauce and my wife took risotto. the dishes were excellently prepare

"a very nice place to sit, relax and enjoy a great meal after visiting many a tourist attraction. a great spot for a great meal"
"i ate here twice, and both time enjoyed the food and the setting. food was very good, but the vegetarian options were limited."
"this is not a fine dining restaurant, but the food is always good and the service very friendly. the wine selection is above average and when in season, their wild game is amazing (deer, wild pig and hare)."
there arent many dutch restaurants that know how to cook or even have a concept of good customer service. this restaurant is one of those rare exceptions. excellence through and through.
"i have been to this restaurant a couple of times over the last few years. every time both service and the food have been excellent. during the asparagus season they prepare many different and tasty dishes based on this. the athmosphere is nice and in my opinion, value for money is very good."
"very nice and cozy restaurant with all the atmosphere that is required to get a taste of this nice region in the center of the netherlands de veluwe. particularly the velwse schavuyt, the local beer, was very nice. try to pronounce schuimkraag and if you succeed, you will be recognised as a real dutch scoundrel."
"if youre looking for a wonderful french style restaurant, youll not go wrong here. this was my second visit (my first in 2014) and it was really good (again). the waitress this time (not sure her name) was so helpful and had a fantastic sense of humour. she just added to the excellent food so i cannot recommend the de bon vivant enough. if youre staying at the bastion het loo hotel, this restaurant is only ten minutes walk along the road towards apeldoorn town centre. you van miss it!"
the fish and the side dishes were divine. the wine was perfect. the athmosphere was really relaxing. the staff was always smiling. the deserts were presented in an elegant way
"good food, inexperienced / friendly staff, good wines (especially the chardonnay of latour. cosy environment."
"we did visit this place last summer, and it was do or die for my wife, she had some experiences that it was not what se expected from a fine dine. last time the food was simply awesome and for sure will come back. they do also seasonal themes which are great!"
"excellent little bistro on the outskirts of town. we had the set menu. 3 courses all delicious, smoked salmon, rib eye and ice cream dessert. what was level was the service, attentive, though not imposing, charming and helpfu "
we enjoyed our first evening of our short break at this restaurant in apeldoorn. we saw people enjoying their wines and massive portions of mussels. joining them was a fantastic idea. while sitting outside at the warmed terrace we felt welcomed by the pleasant waiters. food was great! dont know about others but we experienced a lovely late summer eve at bon vivant. righteous name for this place!
"a very relaxing and friendly restaurant with excellent service, fine food and a smile. we enjoyed duck breast, the chocolate trio and an ice cream treat for my partner. run and owned by a local couple, there are trappings of the hunter and much evidence of the local area and its proximity to the palace het loo."
restaurant de bon vivant is located near the palace het loo along a beautiful road. and you can park right in front of the restaurant for fr 
"this was a wonderful treat in apeldoorn! the service was great, the waiters were very friendly and informative. furthermore, the food was so good, i couldnt believe what nice food we got for the good price. i would definitely recommend anyone going there!!"
"very friendly waiters and good food. big portions (too big for us), and helpful and very friendly waiters, although we showed up after a ballet show in the theatre"
"when to this place for dover sole and muscles  with beer , was a really good experience i enjoyed how there was a nice selection as well as the friendly service , i would recommend giving this place a visit üòÄ"
"we took good friends out to eat here, we were here before and knew a bit what was coming up, the food they serve is really great, fresh and tastefull, the crew is very nice and helpfull, the atmosphere is nice and cozy, the have a little outside sitting area, the deserts are awesome :) one little downer for me were the mens restrooms, they could use an update, they were clean, but very old."
"we have been here several times, because the service is excellent. the owner and his wife are very friendly to the guests. again the restaurant was fully occupied. every guest becomes a delicious appetizer for free. the menu is adapted to the season. for example in september you can eat a special dutch delicacy, namely: mussels!! in the autumn: loin of venis "
"i really enjoyed having dinner, the quality of the food is good but the service is the best. the owners are very friendly and always trying to make you feel at home."
this restaurant is located in the centre of apeldoorn. mostly and specifically on the weekends you have to book a table (telephone: +31 55 521 314 
the owner was so very warm and inviting to our three generation family during a visit on easter sunda 
"amazing food! absolutely loved the staff and food. fantastic decor in the establishment. i call this place the poffertjes museum, as they allowed me and my girlfriend the experience of trying to make poffertjes. an absolute joy! great for kids, and tasty traditional dutch pancakes"
we ordered rijsttafel for 15 and what came was fantastic. wonderful mixture of foods all delivered free of charge including heated serving trays. absolutely wonderful and made our large family celebration very easy. thanks
very nice and authentic indonesian restaurant. the owner was very friendly and recommended us a good combination of food. i will definitely eat at this place again if i am visiting apeldoorn
"nice restaurant delicious food friendly and welcoming services, mostly recommended if you want to try indonesian food taste or if you miss indonesian food. no complain!"
"i have been here yesterday with my niece and her friends from wageningen university. we ordered soto and the others nasi rames served with nasi kuning , rendang, semor and indonesian pickles (acar) and some snacks. i have been to many indonesian restoran in holland before and i can tell you this is the best i have ever been, all food was very tasty especially soto ayam ! this recepie you can only get in indonesia! my niece and her friends atmitted it too. in no time we devoured all food served "
"the food is great. the service is friendly and the atmosphere is fantastic. we ordered tapas for 10 and pointed out that one of our party was vegetarian. the staff made sure that they were catered for. on the whole, a wonderful experience."
we went for a sunday afternoon ride on the bike and landed here.  surprised: nice and comfortable setting. some holiday lightning. good background music. and cute little dog.
"just a quick stopover for lunch, good food, fast and friendly service. the restaurant is located at the edge of a glider plane field a real nice scenery. we drove past on sunday and saw many gliders up in the air, looking for thermals for their planes to climb. today being monade it was quiet and not that many guests nor glider planes."
"me and my husband have visited thuis place multiple times and it is still the best place to have some ramen in holland. the soup with chicken and calpis (drink) is great. gyoza is always good there. the owner actually is interested in how you perceive the food and if the level of spicyness is spicy enough for you. if not, he will make some changes for you. we even tried some other places like ramen ya but the broth of ramen ya was not as good as set. the quality for the price you receive is excellent. there isnot a lot of options on the menu but the soup and appetizers om the menu are great ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"this has become one of our go-to places. the food is exceptionally fresh, always good and full of flavor. the prices are good and the service attentive. we like the intimate atmosphere. a great option alone or with a small group."
"while trying to think of a place to dine after a long trip, my friends and i decided to give this place a try. one of us is a local the "
"i read a couple of reviews on here, and i was very surprised to read other people‚Äôs experiences in set for wish arnhem. my boyfriend and i have been coming to this place for years now, and we have loved it ever since our first visit "
"i come often in set for wish. the interior is very simple but the food is delicious. they serve typical japanese style noodlesoups and don with rise. there are varities with chicken, beef, seafood and vegetarian. you can choose the hot-level but beware: the vulcano and higher are very hot. they use naga jolokia and reaper peppers for it. one of the hottetst peppers in the world."
noodle soup is made fresh with fresh ingredients. i recommend the king miso udon and the dumplings. japanese soda is also nice.
"whenever i went to a japanese place that was cheap. but this was an exception. the place is very small and nothing to brag about the ambience. but it is in the centre of the city and provides very nice food in good portion for a reasonable price. so, we loved it. want to go back there again."
"popped in for a business lunch and i was very much impressed. very good food. friendly service. nice terrace. and from what‚Äôs i could see, the interiors of the restaurant looked very good too."
we had booked a table and were seated quickly even though it was very busy. we were advised on the wines for sale and our order was taken quickly and professionally. the food was excellent although the card was a bit confusing as it was not clear if the food was served with sauce and vegetables. they were mentioned separately on the menu and were not included with the meal. ordering a full meal one does expect a matching sauce to be part of the meal.
we loved the burgers and the service was friendly. a excellent restaurant for a good quick meal.  they have a good selection of hamburgers and other similar meals. we love going to the beer franchise restaurant all of them are good!
friendly staff and good service. the food us affordable and has large  portions. close to the cinema where we went after. love the ribs and their sandwiches! great recommendation and very affordable.
we were headed for the italian but they were queuing up the street so we turned into this little gem of a restaurant. service was very good and friendly. good choice of beer and great choice of food. waitress was very understanding as our and her first language was not english. we sat outside and was great with good heating even in the thunderstorm. highly recommended restaurant would definitely go back. 
"went here on a monday to have unlimited spareribs. service was quick at first but after our first round, we hardly had any service. it took forever to get drinks later on too. spareribs come with fries and salad (once) and are very tasty!! ketjap was my favorite, although i didnt try all of them."
"new nice restaurant next to arnhem station. we went here for a quick bit just before the cinema. the food was good and more than enough, service was quick and waiter was friendly. was quite busy so might need reservations?"
"first time visitor, nice restaurant and location is close to hotels and train station. very good food although service was a bit slow on drinks. happy overall though and would visit again."
i was told that this was a new restaurant and that i had to go there with my teens to have a nice experience. indeed it was. we took the unlimited spare ribs option which is available on thursdays and if i m correct also on mondays. the ribs and the chips were excellent.
we were early for lunch so it was quiet inside. great quick service and good suggestions for options. food tasted amazing!
"excellent for gluten free.  separate prep and excellent gf bagels.  definitely recommend! if you have celiac disease, dont worry - they know what they are doing!"
"i had a delicious bagel with loads of avocado a few other veggies, and chive cream cheese.  really tasty and only 5.50 euros.  good price for wonderful food.  although the restaurant was crowded, service was quick."
see above. everything they have is good but i do take detours for their cappuccino. i can also recommend the dadeltaart.  not much to do for children except for drawings.
"their large capuchino is the best to give you that pep in your step, food is organic and the classical playlist theyve got is so soothin "
love bagel & beans and been to many of it. like other b&b this one is bigger so have more space. service was good and food was delicious. the only thing i dislike in ever b&b is why are serving plates to small ?!
"i have been to many bagels & beans now, delicious every time! i personally think the iced coffee here is the best ive ever had. the service is really good, and a perfect location too if youre shopping for the day in arnh "
i have been here a couple of times and i love it. everything is organic and fresh. the sandwiches look small but it will be enough to make you full. the different combinations of sandwiches are odd and different from another restaurants but really tasty. this is an special place that you will love or you will hate. the coffee is perfect and the tea really special. i will not recommend the smoothies. it has high prices.
"located in the heart of the old city, this is a good vegetarian friendly restaurant. i ordered the tuna-cheese melt, which was quite good. note that it is only open until about 5:00 p.m. so it is mainly a breakfast-lunch place."
"bagels & beans is a shop with wide variety of bagels and decoration, but yet keeps its very own style. rustique and yet provocative, conservative and stimulating."
"place isnt too large, so i suggest to make a reservation.  very quaint spot that serves really good food!  place was busy when we went.  prices are very reasonable and service was speedy!"
"delicious! the waiter was very kind. the food was served fast and it was really good.  i can recommend this place to anyone with a budget. if im in arnheim again, i will come back!   thank you."
"we get food from this little gem every week for the past 3 years now. the food is delicious and authentic. the service is great. cant wait for the next visit. i recommend everything from the menu, but my favourite is the thai streetfood noodle soup."
amazing food! such big portions and so well priced!!! the waitresses are so fun & friendly & the atmosphere is really happy
"authentic and tasty food with lovely service. all around a great experience, would highly recommend!"
price ans quality of the food is good. i like the home made ice tea. pork and duxk with noodle is the best! we have enjoyed our lunch over there.
clean open kitchen where you can see how the food is prepar 
"i‚Äôm not completely sure if i want to share this one with you. it‚Äôs so good, i want to make sure it will remain here snd as good as it was today. found this restaurant per accident, and a very happy accident it was! it‚Äôs only small and doesn‚Äôt have a high-end decoration, but the friendliness of the staff and above that the quality of food was nothing short of fantast "
"finding proper chinese food in arnhem at reasonable prices is a struggle. tried this place and was pleasantly surprised - good portions, friendly service, reasonably priced and tasted. nothing fancy, just a nice quick meal!"
"after the opening, we tried this place. now we visit this hidden gem weekly. its like we are in asia, so friendly and fresh cooking with love. for max 10‚Ç¨ the best beef noodle, thai wok, beef curry, chicken vegetables, soupsüòÄ"
one of the best sandwiches i ever had! cosy authentic relaxed atmosphere. italian size coffee sandwich bar. superbe coffee and helpful friendly staff. must go place
"nice little place serving toasties. what can you do with one of these. isnt it just cheese and ham? well, even if it is, they come on very nice wholemeal bread and great melted chee "
"have been coming to this restaurant since they opende basically and since it has been my go to restaurant. with friends, family or even alone. always great food and surprising combinations. never had a bad dish here. also the wine paring is absolutly stand out."
"give these folks their first michelin star already! excellent tasty food with beautiful presentation, great front of house, impeccable hospitality, while being unpretentious. highly recommended!"
on a halfyearly basis i schedule a dinner meeting with a business relation / old collegue. by coincidence i did see the website of cuisson and thought to give it a try. result : we did discovera hidden gem in the centre of arnhem. both quality as well as presentation of the food were very good. staff and cook perfect. will revisit for sure.
"we are regular visitors to arnhem and have tried many of the restaurants there, so when a dutchman recommended cuisson as a new restaurant with excellent quality we thought we would give it a go. we were not disappointed, the food was excellent. we took the chefs 3 course surprise and the wonderful presentation of the food was matched by the quality of the ingredients and the taste. the chef came to show us the pieces of meat (duck breast for me) and fish (for my wife) before he cooked it to ask if we were happy with it! i think this is the finest dining we have had in all our stays in arnhem."
"it is a bit hidden away and you may be tempted to go in one of the other restaurants or bars that you will pass, but it is really worth fighting that temptation and walking a bit furthe "
"we went there for a lunch with the kids. the place has a us diner/steakhouse vibe, perfectly decorated and even featuring us school bus "
"loved what they did to this place, its been years since i was last here. modern, industrial look inside. friendly staff, good parking, indoor and outdoor seating. food was also very modern and not too expensive. theres also a drive through! will be back!!"
"this is probably one of the best places to eat in arnhem! its a little but outside town (20 min by e-bike), but the food is amazing and the restaurant is decorated very nice! service is very good, cost a little above average, but i had the ribeye! lots of parking as we "
"great place to eat and drink with friends and family. local beers, vege options in menu. even when local was full and busy manager find a table on saturday."
visited with a group of friends. good is great and comes in relatively large portions. staff are very friendly and very professional. would definitely recommend to anyone. it‚Äôs always very packed so make sure you book!
we had a really nice experience with this restaurant. food was really good (we ordered the spareribs) and staff was friendly and efficient. we recommend this place.
"we visited the restaurant in august 2021, after a long day in burger zoo. the atmosphere and service in the restaurant is top-notch and even the huge amount of children did not bother is, since they have a playground downstairs. the food was great and cooked exactly as we preffered it. the only downside from my experience was the poorly washed beer glass, which resulted in stale beer. however, the experience in general made me want to return."
"we visited here as a couple in august after hearing reviews from friends. i miss the american dining experience and this place delivers. to start my boyfriend had the pulled pork tacos, tasted great. we then both had burgers and mine was cooked perfectly, exactly how i asked. he doubled his up, but said next time he wouldnt as it was to much. fries came along with mayo and ketchup ( didnt need to ask for it for a change) then as it was quite warm, we decided to get a dessert from the takeaway drive though. i had a milkshake, and it was really nice. plan to go back soon, its my new favorite restaurant that reminds me of ho "
very nice place. great variety on the menu. the mix grilled was excellent. they serve free coleslaw and fries with your meal and they keep refilling them as much as you want to eat. price is also good.
"we had a wonderful family meal and everyone ended up satisfied . we where first seared at the back of the restaurant and it was very dark and under lighted. we asked to move and decided to sit outside as it was a warm evening. the starters where brought out without any issues and where delicious. the mains where brought out 5-7 minutes apart, so the first 3 meals where sitting on the table roughly 7 minutes before the other meals where brought out to us. as you can imagine the food was then starting to get cold. i did complain and was served a fresh tuna steak within 3 minutes. apart from this the rest of the evening went without a problem. the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great. the children had a great time downstairs in the childrens area. there is a cinema,junglegym and lots of video arcade games for the children to enjoy. there is also an outside playground . the prices where on the high end of the scale but the quality of food was good so i cant complain too much all in all i would give this restaurant a good 4/5. we will be visiting again soon and hopefully can boost the score."
super nice restaurant with delicious food. everything in a american style. the menu was in english but also dutch. they even are playing country music. so the ambiance was great. food was even better. the staff is young but super friendly. loved it! we had a very good evening. we will be back in a few weeks.
arrived late at nearby hotel and found most places clos 
good food and buzzy atmosphere. great basement play area for kids - much more than the normal soft okay (though that too). decent service. watch out for speed cameras in the area!
"my husband had the ribeye and i had the ribs. both were excellent and came with apple compote, coleslaw and skin-on-fries. also free mayo and ketchup (very rare). i took the rest of my ribs home as the portion was large. the atmosphere was great and i loved the decor. a real americana feel."
several outdoor seatings perfect for enjoying a lunch or a beer in the su 
"food is very good but a little bit far from the real american flavor. i asked for a glass of water and i got surprised it was in my bill, commonly it is for free"
loved to american vibes here. the arcades downstairs are amazing and so is the service. ruben and lisa were both great hosts!
"we are returning customers to the roadhouse. sunday lunch with friends and the kids has been on all occasions an absolute pleasure! food is great! staff are thoughtful, prosfessional yet friendly and familiar! kids have the time of their lives in the kids cellar which has a clean soft play area, mini cinema and other games! we will most definitely be back agai "
"we just happened upon this lovely tapas restaurant, and really enjoyed the food. set price and you can eat as much as you like by choosing from the extensive menu two dishes per person at a time. very good value but do book as it gets very bu "
"located near the pathe (movie theatre), in a nice d√©cor a well functioning staff with great food makes this to a very nice experience for a decent price."
excellent creative food in a cozy neighbourhood location. we had the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairing selected by our waiter. the staff were very knowledgeable about each dish and the wines. service was excellent and relaxed. each dish was delicious and balanced in use of flavours and textures. excellent cheese course with local cheeses. a must if you are visiting arnhem.
do not hesitate. reserve a table. order the chef surprise 4 course menu. you will be amazed. excellent dishes with sometimes very unusual food combinations. served by very knowledgeable and friendly staff. and you can follow the chef through the open kitchen. unless you have elected to eat outside. very large wine selection with som very expensive wines! the chef is clearly on his way to high ratings and more!
we very much enjoyed trying all the different dishes and unique flavors. we really enjoyed our evening and will definitely come back!
we were visiting arnhem for a quick weekend 1-day trip and decided to have dinner at ‚Äòt volk. an amazing place! for only under 40 euros you get access to all-you-can-eat menu of fusion cuisine. the staff was very attentive and all the dishes - great! nice cocktails as well.
wow. i knew owner hui from a few years back in armhen and he was always known as a very creative chef so i had high expectations‚Ä¶ and it did not disappoint. this is really #nextf***inglevel stuff. a man really at the top of his game. whatever your tastes i think there is something for y 
a nice caf√© with a nice selection of draught beer and snacks. a good place to have coffee as well. the bitterballen are our favorite. a typical dutch snack served with mustard. it is a meatball shapef croquette with a variety of fillings.
"this is a great little cafe centrally located. great wine, food and atmosphere. visit any time of the day for good service and a cosy atmosphere."
"in arnhem for war and other museums wanted to eat local and low key. babo cafe was perfect. a very helpful bartender thomas translated the menu, we selected a grilled local fish and a slightly cooked hamburger (tartare like) with bitteballs as a first course, great local fried treat. accompanied a couple of different white beers and we were very hsppy. place was busy and price reasonable."
"first of all : order a double espresso here and you have had the best in town. taste, color, crema, temperature, a glass of water to complete the picture... the have a selective bakery selection that is worth trying! the food is easy & creative .. vegetarian cannelloni, hot steamy straight from the oven (with warming of course) ... do not forget the friendly energy of the staff... busy as always and always an eye free to connect again... there is a kind of a scene of clients without a name ... an atmosphere you like or not! i like i "
babos is situated fairly central in the pedestrian labyrinth that is arnhem city cent 
"had dinner here and was very impressed. great food, service and atmosphere. i had the fish of the day and it was very tasty. seemed reasonably priced too. stayed for a few drinks after dinner and enjoyed the nice vibes. will be back very soon."
"brilliant mexican. we had the mexican platter for two. it was delicious and a great way to experience a variety of mexican dishes. also, the margaritas were very tasty. the service was friendly and efficient, exactly as i like it to be."
most importantly the food we had was absolutely delicious! one of the best mexican restaurants i have had dinner at. we had the plate with a variety of appetizers and the fiesta mexicana as main cours 
enjoy nice food and service together with warm atmosphere and nice climate for dinner for two in the center of arnhem
"this is our go to restaurant when in arnhem. good quality food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere. we had a couple of cocktails, the burrito kip and combination de is casa with ribs. very tasty, nicely presented. guacamole is very creamy and we had some with our drinks with the tortilla chips and salsa. give it a try, it is well worth a visit."
"we enjoy mexican food in australia (where we live), and have eaten it in the us too. this was our first in europe, and it was of a different style to what we expected. however the meals were very tasty, and the earnings generous. yes, the presentation was the same for our different main courses, but inviting all the same. service was friendly, though a little slow at times. menus in english are available and at least one lovely server was very fluent and helpful. wed gladly return."
"loved the food and service here a great place for vegetarians i had wheat tortilla filled with spinach and mushrooms and topped with cheese , guacamole , slaw refried beans and mexican rice and we went on a monday when cocktails were half price strawberry margaritas delicious üòã "
"the restaurant is located in a plaza where many other restaurants and caf√©s are standing. it is also a few meters away from the shopping street. the waitress was very attentive and even suggested some dishes as well as explaining the portions. you get nacho chips with salsa on the house. i ordered enchiladas which is possible to finish alone if you order no starter. it comes with two small filled soft tortillas with either chicken or ground beef and small portions of rice, beans, pico de gallo and coleslaw. everything was very savoury however, it is not so spicy if you‚Äôre a spicy lover. i definitely recommend it. the atmosphere is very chill too."
"food was very tasty and we were very satisfied with the quantity ! quesadilla was great and so was the appetizers (especially spicy chicken  , salads). nice ambience ! recommended !"
"for those who love a good mexican menu, this is certainly the place to go. i went there twice and everything i ate was great! good thing to go in the summer and sit outside! love the guacamole!"
"myself and some friends visited on saturday night, it was very very busy. we waited a very long time for food, and the waitresses were not very attentive, having to prompt them on ordering drinks. food was tasty, especially the meat fajitas."
"i ate the enchilladas (pork+vegetables) here and i must say that they are very very tasty! spice enough to make you feel that hot flavour, although not enough to make you cry, which is nice!  i recommend it for a good mexican food experience!"
i was in arnhem with 3 friends on a visit to the battlefields. we went out with no idea what we were going to eat. we saw that this restaurant looked busy and took that as a good sign. the food was excellent with a good choice of 3 courses for a fixed price. i would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a spicy good value meal in arnhem.
thanks for the great service. atmosphere was very good and the food was ok.  margarita is perfect.  the tables was full and no delays on the servise.
"first the atmosphere on the restaurant is great typical mexican decoration and latin music. the staff was good. the food spicy as it was supposed to be and very good. the portions are huge! the picture is from the fajitas dish, were this plater comes to the table and you assemble your own fajitas. loved the beans and the guacamole! i would definitely come back."
"whether you go out for a quick trip to arnhem or you are visiting the veluwe, pssst amigo is a great restaurant to lunch or have a big meal. surprisingly good quality at the right price."
"havent been in arnhem like for ages! and decide this time to pay a visit to my favorite restaurant during my college period in holland,  and guess what? still in love with the food and especially the service! gracias por no cambiar!"
"this place is authentic, lovely food, nice staff and great location. we recommend highly and would eat there again. thank you"
food was excellant and as a mexican food lover was most impressed. my daughter also loved it and was a 1st for her. not bad price either and very pleasant staff and surroundings.
"while arnhem isnt used for its great city center, this place is right in the middle of the nightlife. its not open until very late but a great place to go if you want to eat something in a nice mexican atmosphere. the waiters are patient and they provide some coloring materials for small children. when me and my family wanted to put some tables together the waiters made no problem of it and helped us in creating the desired situation. i recommend reserving as it is usually quite bu "
"nice mexican food, fair price, good cocktails. you get nachos with a dip with your apperitive so you dont need a starter. thats nice for your bill at the end. portions are big enough. i choose the lamb and it was excellent. i ordered corn on the side, they forgot it but that wasnt a problem for me because i was satisfied with the size of my portion. and it made my bill smaller :-) nice interior also, bit dim but cosy and mexican. this restaurant was full all the time and makes good business. sometimes long waiting times to take your order."
"we sat down outside and had a lovely dinner. i had the spare-ribs and they were delicious. would have wished for more spicy sauce, but i probably could have asked for it. my girfriend had the tacos and claims they were really good. the atmosphere inside is cool."
"i have to agree with others reviewers that the margaritas were excellent, the food as well, the service too. really have nothing to complain about. they were restructuring the bar, so the coffee maker was out of service, but apart from that everything was peachy."
"we go here primarily for the margaritas, we even take a horrible 30 minute bus trip for it. great price, and great taste! food is nice too (for food i would stay in home town "
in this cute restaurant the food is great. i like the tapas because then i can choose different tnings at once. the tacos etc are great too. please do not forget the desserts because theyre delicious!!
since 1998 i have been visiting this restaurant and i have never had bad food. the cocktails are good and there is plenty to choice. its one of my favorite restaurants. i always make a reservation for a table because it can be busy here.
"ive been here on a saturday to have some mexican food with my girlfriend. the restaurant is located in the centre of arnhem, close to the korenmarkt. we got a table on the upper floor where it was unfortunately a bit too dark and very warm. after starting with some tacos we hade a plate full of meat as the entrance menu. it tasted very good and almost seemed like an entire meal. as main course i had the chimichanga which tasted very good. to top it of we had some ice scream which was extra good due to the high temperature in the room. the girl serving us was new and forgot many things but since it was here first week i didnt see this as a probl "
"visited with friends while on wwii sites trip, appears to be always busy and we found out why, some of the best mexican food i have had in europe. we were seated upstairs and found it a little dark for us (group of men) but as i said some of the best food. heartily recommend the chimichangas, superb. would without doubt recommend a trip to amigos if in town."
i have visited this restaurant very many times over 15 years and i havent eaten poor here. i have had almost every dish and ofcourse i have my favorites. im not a fan of the desserts here. there good be a change in this menu. this is not a reason to have no dinner here. the coffees and chocolatemilk are a good replacements :o) and the hot kalua is heavenly.
"amazing indian cousine, with an incredible amount of options (for every preference). friendly people and great ambiance. 10/10 recommend!"
"this places serves very nice indian food, rich in taste and high in quality. friendly staff as well, worth a visit."

"went for an early thursday evening dinner. ordered lamb korma, dal soup, murg tikka, garlic naan and roti. the korma came with raita and a small salad. the korma was to die for. the chicken very tasty. rice was included and the fine grain was very good cooked. raita was a big portion and at no extra pay. the roti was filled with lentils and the garlic naan topped with fresh coriander. we left with a full stomach and can no more than recommend this restaurant. it is worth a full five stars besides the fact the poppadums were not as crunchy, as expected and there was only one server. but we had our food within reasonable time. and no one else complaint. "
"we ate here in early august. it was a really good curry. we had chicken jalfriezi, bombay aloo and tarka dal. all tasty and very spicy. as good as any in england we have had. cobra was pricey but the local beer was as good and a lot cheap "
"the food was absolutely great. among the finest indian food weve had in the netherlands. the dishes are simple, like they should be, and very tasty. prices are very reasonable, t "
"very tasty indian food, great atmosphere and very nice and friendly staff. will definitely return and would like to recommend it."
"we went for dinner on a weekend. we ordered biryani, roti, 2 curries and tandoori mixed gri "
we were here in march fir a dinner with frien 
"went here when on business, starters were very nice as were the main courses, very big portions!! i would recommend the mixed grill!  will come again when in arnhem."
"when looking for the restaurant i wasn‚Äôt too happy that it is in a 2nd rate alley richt next to a local coffeeshop. but when inside it was soon forgotten. the service was friendly and the food was excellent. we went for the surprise menu. this menu really had something for everyone at the table, spicy food, mild food and severall vegetarian dishes. when i am in arnhem i will for sure return too this restaurant. "
"visited this restaurant in mid december, the food and service was great and was delivered to our table quickly, i had a lamb vindaloo which was very hot and spicy. the vegetable curry was also delicious. the actual restaurant was busy,which for me is always a good sign, and the staff speak english another bonus "
"i have reached arnhem late night & restaurant was closed, but they supported us lot, they opened the kitchen again and prepared food for us also my kid enjoy the food well thanks for the support"
"i travel to arnhem for business every couple of months or so and often eat here. the welcome is always warm, the food tasty and freshly prepared, and the prices are reasonable and value for money."
"been to this place now 3 times and spanning over 3 years and the place has got better then it was. we started with onion bahjis and kebabs and that started the meal really well, great quality of kebabs and really nice onion bahji "
the kohinoor is a lovely gem of a restaurant. staff were friendly and the food was excellent.   you should try it if you are in arnhem.
i love eating at kohinoor of india in arnhem. service is fast and food is super delicious. even the take outs and home delivery are well taken care of. papadoms get to my house whole and everythings still wa 
it was quite quiet when i went it but the service and food were outstanding.  id thoroughly recommend it.
this is really a very enjoyable restaurant it is very well decorated and the staff are very good we had 2 starters 2 mains naan bread and a bottle of wine  ‚Ç¨70 the food was delicious and good sized portions all in all highly recommended.
"everything about this restaurant is fantastic. the staff are super friendly and helpful and the food is just out of this world - well cooked, full of flavour. huge portions. worth a trip to arnhem just to eat here again."
all you can reasonably expect from a high quality indian restaurant. it does what it says on the tin.
"went there with a golleague and had the meat and vegi menu. you get a lot of dishes (actually too much for us) so only order this when hungry or share! food tastes authentic, service is kind. if i had to make one (small) negative remark, the naan bread was below expectation. otherwise much recommended!"
"wide selection of dishes with a range of spiciness. i personally like saag dishes, and they catered well for me in this respect. friendly staff."
"weve had food from here delivered at our place last night and we were surprised at how the food were neatly packed. the containers are different, the rice smells fresh and clean and was warm. we love the chicken madras since it was not too spicy. the paneer was neatly cooked and everything was just so neat, fresh and right to the taste. great papadoms guys. we were one happy customer last night and if the service stays as great as that, well patroniz "
for me this was the best indian food i had so far! been to around a dozen of indian restaurants but taste wise this is one of the bes 
"it is a place near rozet. the food was good, traditional indian dishes. the staff was also good and the atmosphere was cozy. a nice place overall."
"apart from the slightly slow arrival of the menu, i cannot fault this indian restaurant. food was tasty and arrived on time. i ordered rogan josh which was properly spicy, unlike the mild offerings from other restaurants in nl"
"we had dinner here with our friends and i love their shrimp dish specially that their shrimp comes from places where it is mercury free. the waiters were very friendly, the food was great and i suggest that you just go to their main dishes since its ample enough even for big eater "
"there is a lot of choice in kohinoors menu, from the chefs surprise 3-course menu, to the expected tandoori dishes, as well as a lot of vegetarian choices. the staff is ok (there was a table waiting to order, and the waiter was at the next table, chatting with some indian friends of his. it didnt affect us, but i guess that somehow the waiter could have been a little more concerned with all his patron "
we left it to the manager to bring us a range of dishes - we were treated with a lovely selection varying in spicy/hot flavour nice setting lovely evening out
"the best indian food in arnhem, really an authentic taste like i am used to in india. the service is good and the people are very nice. a good ambiance, i was feeling like home."
"this restaurant is just off a side street, near the holiday inn, arnhem - look for it, its a great indian restaurant. we only called in as it was raining and close to the hotel, from the outside its not enticing, but over come this as the food and service was brilliant. we all like our indian food and the selection we were given was lovely and tasty, with plenty of it. they also had sweets not normally found in most restaurants, proper traditional sweets not just ice cream or deep fried pineapple in syrup. next time we are there it will be the first place to visit."
"if simple and homey rice dishes are what you are looking for then you cant go wrong with the biryanis at kohinoor. in fact, it is even better than any of the nasi goreng at the indonesian restaurant or the fried rice at the chinese restaurant in arnhem. the reasons, kohinoor use good basmati rice and less oil and salt to cook them. they are also freshly made so you will really taste the spices. but be warned that it has one waitress to serve a sizeable restaurant."
"attended with friends from arnhem, and we loved it.  small, ok area.  interesting little walk as you approach the restaurant.  take time to know the town."
food worth the wait and boy did we have to wait despite the fact the restaurant wasnt very bu 
"we loved this place - quick and very friendly service, well priced and tasted really good. the korma was very sweet which i loved but it could have been a little too sweet for some. would definitely return."
well went to this restaurant the second night i went for dinner in arnhem well staff where friendly the owner and his daughter where working as well i ordered mix kebab platter the taste flavour where great for main course i had tak dal and bombay aloo the rice nan bread the flavour and hotness was just as like i had really great time 
"thursday night is buffet night with 10-12 different dishes for  a  very affordable price: ‚Ç¨18.50 pp  and check their facebook for promotion! our biggest problem was, we liked everything so, that we ate too much."
"a perfect spot for veggies. the persian potato pie with lemon we had as a starter was sooooo delicious, not to mention the perfect chocolate desert with raspberries. loved the backyard garden area. recommended!"
"we found this little restaurant using the happy cow vegetarian/vegan app. what a lovely place. set out beautifully, quaint but modern. the staff were really helpful, translating the menu into english for us. the menu was small - 3 starters, 2 mains and 3 desserts but all the ones we tried were excellent. they only accept cash and dutch bank cards. cost 67eur for 2 people, 3 courses and 2 beers each. well worth a visit, id be a regular if i lived near "
"awesome food, always fresh and seasonal. great mix of different food cultures with local products. and the menu changes regularly so you wont get bored. well come back again."
"what a perfect place for a diner with friends!the people are friendly, the service is nothing to complain about and the quality of food is really nice! this atelier belongs to these places where the choice among the different courses is not that big, but this values even more the quality of the food! it is definitely worth to try it and eventually better to book it in advance if the group is bigger than 4 people, as the space is a little bit smaller, mainyl during the weekend."
"we visited this bar on a friday night after dinner. it was a cold night, but it didn‚Äôt stop lots of brave dutch people sitting on the heated outside terrac "
"..well, at least thats how the website describes its own vibe (modern & timeless). pretty accurate actually. been there several times and keep coming back. the menu is pretty good but i would recommend the daily special - which always seems to be another notch up. oh, and on a sunny day enjoy the outside seating along with a g&t or a jd&c. makes it all the bett "
"nice outside area, great for sunny days. food is great, saw some of the main courses passing by, they looked mjummie! we just had the mix&dip platter, nice and different. the staff is nice as well."
"it is amazing after all those years, that the quality of the food is every time a wonderful experience. service in and outdoor is something made by hand per person. but the inner-core is still going strong. i keep coming back here with pleasure."
bar florian is a nice and pleasant bar to enjoy youre sunny afternoon. it has a big variety of all kinds of food. from freshly made paninis to beautiful sushi and sashimi. and this for a affordable price.
"we are italian and we know when food is good, but also dino knows it. from fish to meat, everything was simply amazing  goodbye from the italian volleyball fans, ciao!"
"the owner, his daughter and staff warmly welcomed us into their restaurant on a very busy night  we had excellent service, great food and thoroughly enjoyed our visit, would definitely recommend"
we went to dinos to celebrate our anniversary on a friday night. it was fabulous! they received us with smiles and congratulations in every visit to our table. the food was scrumptious and the atmosphere has a very intimate decoration. definitely we will be back!
"wonderful food and excellent service. glutenfree is no problem at all, almost all the dishes can be glutenfree and they really know what they are doing."
"visited with three friends after reading some of the other reviews. friendly staff three excellently prepared meals, cooked to perfection. surf and turf, ribs and a steak. would not hesitate to recommend the restaurant. will be back if i ever visit again. loved it. no photo as i was too busy eating it. "
"good quality food for a small price. nice menu, bit towards basic. great service. wine could be better."
"absolutely gorgeous food for reasonable price and great atmosphere. special thanks to our waiter attila , who made everything even more perfect :)"
"had a great evening here, enjoyed the hospitality and the great food. got a nice discount on top of that."
"sat inside, watching the town walk by very good atmosphere. a warm welcome, great servi "
"just on the edge of the very centre, so not quite so much in the hussle-bustle. i had a very tasty beef tournedo, cooked to perfection. very friendly service."
we had a very enjoyable dinner in this restaurant. the ribs were delicious and so was the sea bass. portions are very generous.
"the ribs are one of the best that i have tried and the service is terrific! ask for atila, he is always nice and willing to recommend good dishes!"
"i wrote about dinos back in may, this time we returned for the third year to be met with a great smiling dino and his staff, again he recognised us and showed us to a good table, the food like always is awesome, great value for money, service is quick and always by smiling staff. it was so good we went back on the saturday. his greeting was even louder than fridays with customers looking to see who had walked in, he had a special table for us and before we could order he told us he and his chef had arranged a special meal....a large rib eye steak and the trimmings . dinos always has a good happy atmosphere and i (and brothers ) fully recommend it to anyo "
"great little family restaurant near the centre of town. good atmosphere, great food and service at a reasonable price. only flaw in the food was the squirty cream with the dessert. tight space and steps means its not good for wheelchairs or prams."
"called in here for a drink on our way back to our hotel and on seeing the food brought out we decided to eat here. best idea we‚Äôve had to date in arnhem. staff were friendly and welcoming. nothing was too much trouble, and the food........ it was stunning. i had the mushrooms to start hubby had prawns then i had ribs hubby had burger. it was faultless and loads of it. we felt guilty leaving so much. a lovely little bolt hole in arnhem that i would fully recommend."
"i visited dino‚Äôs while on a weekend trip with my wife. we came here following the great reviews on trip advisor, and were not disappointed. this is a lovely warm and homely restaurant where we felt welcome from the moment we walked through the door. we enjoyed the lively, but not excessively noisy atmosphere and the food was great as well. we both chose the spare ribs with a sweet sauce. delicious! definitely a place i would be happy to come back to again. "
we visited this restaurant on the edge of the cornmarket as it offered three courses for 23 eu 
dinos is crushed into  a cornmarket cornucopia of bars and restaurants. great place to hang out and watch the wild side of arnhem on night time manouvres.
"i and my 2 brothers and a friend went to dinos in sep 17 within minutes we were greeted by the dino who recognised us from 2016 as did some of the staff and treated us really well. the food is great, a good choice, quickly prepared and vey well presented. your not rushed and it is a great experience.....recommend it to every "
"working in arnhem for the day, we needed a place to eat that suited tastes for each of the family, and stat! with my hangry brood in tow, we stumbled upon dino‚Äôs and with a quick look at the menu we flew through the door hopeful to get a seat in what looked like a popular plac "
had a lovely evening here.food really good.staff great. very attentive. would recommend it.great atmosphere. we had 3 course meal which was well worth the money.
the food was very good here---my wife is a picky eater and she really enjoyed it. i really liked the beers--the variety and the taste--especially the winter beer.  i also liked the atmosphere which was warm welcoming and friendly.
"visited the place with children, service was excellent and food came quite good. english version of the menu was outdated"
"i always try to eat at dinos when visiting arnhem. the food is great and reasonably priced, and staff make you feel so welcome. they have both dutch and english language menus."
after entering this restaurant two things immediately stand out: the genuine welcome by the staff and the lovely interior. in various ways cosy dining areas have been create 
"had drinks and meals here several times during our stay in arnhem, the food was amazing, top quality and service was second to none. we didnt want to leave! thank you attila and karlyn for your kindness and friendship."
"i have not found a reasonably priced restaurant eleshere in arnhem to beat dinos. the name suggests italian, but it is a mix of south american (barbecue) with a bit of local dutch and a smidgeon of french. everyone will find something they like on the me "
"4 of us ate here during kings day, so it was very busy outside with people partying.  the food we had was well cooked and tasty and the service was very good too. 4 very clean plates speaks volumes."
"delicious food, nice atmosphere and service. recommend for dinner and lunch. poor wifi in the back garden."
lovely thai restaurant in a beautiful setting on the river. service was excellent and i enjoyed my food and wine list was upscale
"this restaurant is one of the view most favorite restaurants of mine in arnhem. in a typical asian style atmosphere you can enjoy the authentic delicious food. for many years the same taste and quality. during summer time you can sit in the garden terras at the back or at the terras in the front viewing the rhine river. i will come back here more times! you can take away food too,, they do home delivery and organize catering at your home."
"the food was very fresh, well cooked and tasty. the sweet chicken curry with sweet potatoes and peanuts was extremely tasty. good service from friendly staff."
relaxed atmosphere with authentic thai food. good variety of choice. good place to go with your kids. they addapt the spicyness to your wish! a good recommandation. nice terrace outside.
"nice setting on the river, parking space available nearby. friendly service but the food, though very fresh and tasteful, misses the original flavours of thailand. the peanut sauce e.g. is a dutch version and the curries are too continental. but we had a nice dinner."
"we enjoyed the food very much, the atmosphere was pleasant and the service very attentive. thank you, we will back soon!"
this is the best thai meal i have ever eaten and it was reasonably priced. the salad starter was in a mouth-watering dressing and all the main courses were fragrant and tasty. we had one of the best meals here that we had in our holland/belgium tour this summer and we would definitely recommend this place to people who enjoy oriental food.
"3rd visit in arnhem, 3rd visit at rubens, its a special place for us and one that you can easily recommend - they never disappointed. we loved their skewered shrimps as well as their skewered veal. their winelist is quite interesting and well priced. staff/owners are professional, my special compliments to the man who grills!"
"again we agreed to meet at rubens as we do every 2 years - started wth unlimited shrimp but now our place to meet!! nice affordable wine, shrimp and cheese fondue made it a great evening abd the grill master made it  we will find a way  !!!"
four hungry southampton fans went here during our visit to the wonderful town of arnhem. service was excellent as was the food. sat in the square enjoying the meal set us up perfectly for the rest of the day. we had 2 steak and 2 chicken kebabs perfectly cooked.
"great and imaginative vegetarian choices not the usual veggie burger or omelette offerings . good service and good value for money.  nice location with a comfortable patio. helpful, smiling staff tolerant of our lack of dutch."
we eat here every time we visit arnhem and the gambas are always fantastic and with the great very friendly team this has to be the place to eat
"a traditional indonesian restaurant. outstanding service. the owners have kept to traditional recipes, so food was authentic and flavorful. the maitre-de found us (8 hungry persons) a place, although restaurant was full, and it was (theoretically) after kitchen hours. highly recommended.  (reservation recommended.)"
a small family reunion led us to kumpulan. after a visit to the bronbeek museum and a stroll through the memorial park we had an excellent rijst tafel. the food was delicious and the service very friendly. highly recommended!
"we visited the museum bronbeek about indonesia that is on the same terrain. the museum was a pleasant surprise, but this restaurant even more. they let people in until 1800 sharp, but dinner is served until 20.00. the building is a very nice historical building in a park with a nice view and terrace. the service was fast, the food also came fast. tableware was very simple, but the food was great! they serve indonesian food. we recommend the rice table, that gets you a lot of small servings of different dishes. delicious! price was 35 euro per person for drinks, meal, dessert and coffee. we thought that was very good val "
this is the place for the best indonesian dinners. the restaurant is situated in an old oriental building next to the bronbeek museum for indonesian art and history and home for war veterans. the restaurant would be excellent if they improve their service. it sometimes is a bit chaotic and a long time waiting for your food.
"excellent food, great original  atmosphere, nice personnel and good value for money.. great surroundings"
together with colleagues we had a lovely departmental luncheon at kumpulan. interesting to see the historic surroundings of the dutch past.
we had family reunion luncheon booked for about 40 people so this was a buffet style meal.  the buffet comprised of an assortment of indonesian cuisine dishes offering lots of variety for our guests.  excellent food and service.
"we have frequented kumpulan already for years and we keep coming back. not only is the food very good. the whole restaurant sits in a beautiful park which is home to the netherlands forces pensioners home and shares a lot of history with the restaurant. upon entering the restaurant, one is submerged in an relaxing late-colonial atmosphere which makes the whole experience all the more interesting. highly recommended!"
"the kumpulan restaurant at bronbeel museum and carehome does one trick: it specialises in indonesian food and it is the only thing it does. outside of the hague you probably wont find better indonesian food. and yes that includes indonesia itself. so for a good rijsttafle, head over here. dont expect anything else."
"the restaurant was overflowing with people when we arrived. fortunately they were there for an event and we were able to get a small table on the the enclosed dining porch. the view was lovely and the service was measured and efficient. we ordered the small rifsttafel and had more than enough food for another two people. our table was hardly able to fit it all. the great thing was that both my husband, who likes hot and spicy, and i, who cant tolerate it, were able to enjoy our meals fully. the flavors were excellent and it seemed a very authentic indonesian meal. the only bad thing was having to leave all those delicious leftovers."
this restaurant being a part of bronbeek has the proper ambiance for indo food. the service is friendly there is a good choice of menu and the food is delicious. do try the cendol as dessert.
kumpulan is situated in a historical park with a museum. really great authenthic indonesian food in colonial style building
"to go to this restaurant booking a table in advance is necessary. i regularly go there for business lunch. the bami and nasi rames, a plate full of mixed indonesian dishes, are pleasantly priced and very suitable for lunc "
nice little restaurant. the pancakes were good and well priced. nice setting surrounded by tress. kids play area was good. staff were friendly and helpful. the pancakes were very filling. the kids surprises were better quality than normally to be expected!
"we visited for dinner to enjoy real dutch pancakes and we enjoyed it very much. the restaurant is located in the woods near arnhem. there is good size parking available. the menu has a very wide choice of different pancakes, i choose the apple pancake and it was sufficiently filling and very tast "
"this is at lease the 6th time in a row (once a year in june) that we visit this place. we mentally booked it for 2018. service is great, foor is very good, atmosphere perfect."
"we visited as a family, my kids love pancakes and so much so at this restaurant we had to come back three days later. sweet, savoury, beer, wine, desserts - all things imaginable with beautiful pancakes. worth a visit for sure, go early as they close by 8.00pm. "
"if you are driving through the beautiful oak forests near arnhem and you are hungry, then go to the pannekoekhuis schaarsbergen. the extremely broad selection is unreal. we had venison and wild hare pancakes. they paired very nicely with the local beer that was on tap. the service was outstanding, even with a full house on sunday afternoon! this place is an icon! best pancakes that i have ever had!"
this traditional dutch pancake house has a large menu of all kind of different type pancakes. we come here every year when we stay at the warnsborn campground. great value for money
"we stopped here for lunch, enroute to a b&b we stayed at nearby. despite the name, this restaurant has more than just pancakes. none of the four of us had them. i had pizza, which was great. the wines and beers were also good. depending on the time of year, the patio is a lovely place to enjoy your meal."
"good service and good food in a traditional dutch setting, toilets very clean. no complains at all on the service and speed they work in this place."
"we went here before we went to the arnhem war museum (which is only 200m? away). the menu had a lot of different options in both sweet and salty pancakes. we had never tried salty pancakes before and went for those. the salty pancakes (with cheese, ham, salami + salad / onion, salami) tasted good, especially the salami. we also took desserts, strawberry sorbet? and banana royal.. deliciou "
lovely traditional pannekoek huis with great area for children and even a little present when we left. loved it!
visit here every year go for the blueberry hill if you have a sweet tooth very near the park and excellent value a good taste of holland
"a real tradition the dutch pancake house , staff are friendly and accommodating , choose savoury and sweet pancakes in a relaxing environment ."
"here you can eat small or large. the menu consists of a a wide variety of small plates so you can choose how hungry you are and also eat quite a diverse meal if you like. the service was very welcoming, friendly and helpful. the food was good."
"the food here (all served tapas style) was all delicious, with a huge variety to choose from. the staff were extremely helpful and the wine list by the glass has plenty to choose from."
"i live in arnhem but had never been here. i went after searching for places to eat lunch rather than a main meal. you go in and everything is explained to you by the really helpful staff (who speak english and dutch). you can choose a selection of things from the menu depending on how hungry you are and share them together (or just eat it for yourself). they recommend 3-4 things per person. everything tasted amazing. the mini burger was incredible and the fries were just what i wanted. as you can see by the picture, the sizes are generou "
small bites of a variety of cuisines.. the seating is a bit tight as the place is small. in turn that makes it cozy which suits the entire concept. the majority of bite sized orders are very good and the service is friendly and fast.. sample away and i think youll walk away with a full belly.
the restaurant is a must go if you drop by arnhem. the decoration is cost and the staff very friendly! everything we ordered was genuinely good and tasty. the menu is not translated in english but the staff is here to help :).
this place is my favorite restaurant in arnh 
"went here a few times for lunch. its a really nice small place, often very busy. the menu consists of small dishes and you choose a few of them. they have some classic simple dishes and some more unusual combinations. i like trying new things and never know what to choose, so this is the perfect place for me. "
"i found this spot in tripadvisor and decided to give it a try, based on the good rates.. and i was not disapointed, on the contrary, it was up to the expectatio "
i stopped here to get a quick bite and was so impressed with the food! i ordered 4 small plates and was beyond happy with each of them. the food is delicious and is inexpensive too! great for eating solo or with another person! would definitely come back to eat again. 
"just by coincidence we ended up on the terrace in the sun and then discoverd we could also have dinner here. lots of small dishes, too many for one diner, so we have to come back for the other dishes. i loved the soups, the kangaroo and springrolls: all very nice. very good quality and lots of options!"
anytime were in the area we try to go to this place. its a place where you order all kinds of little dishes which are really well done. not expensive at all and only good experiences here.
"small and intimate restaurant with mood lighting and warm interior decor. great eclectic menu served in small tapas style portions- from spanish favs like calamari and cured meats, to cheeses, prawns, bbq ribs, breads, soups and lots more. small but well bought wine selection and make sure you save room for the amazing puddings. "
"the restaurant has a large selection of hot or cold tapas dishes, including meats, fishes and vegetari "
"we visited with a group of friends. no prior booking but the six of us were made to feel very welcome.   the food was very good and the staff were very friendly.   we would definitely recommend for a relaxed, friendly evening."
food was delicious and the place is cozy!! it was full and the place is a bit short staffed so service was a bit slow but they compensate it being kind and friendly!!! definitively recommended!
"this is a cozy place with very nice and friendly staff, the food is excellent and is quite cheap! we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for our food either. i‚Äôve been coming here for years and would highly recommend it when you‚Äôre visiting arnhem"
"tasty food, nice salad with fruits, good wine, nicely done meat. they let me go outside with my glass of wine before i pay, so i could smoke. i enjoyed my dinner, i felt comfortable."
i found out about this place when staying at the holiday inn and its a short walk from the station. ive tried 3 turkish restaurants in arnhem all with great reviews but this beats them al 
"didnt expect much, after some less than stellar experience in arnhem. boy was i surprised. nice place, friendly staff and superb food. english might not be their strong point, but luckily food is. if you like kebab or turkish food in general, this is the place to visit. just dont plan any activities afterwards. you will be stuffed."
"saw this place walking back to our car from city centre. the moment we entered we knew this was a place to eat. i could call this a place where you could easily get drunk, hangout and fly over few hours just to notice where have the time gone!!? big oldish style windows, harmony of colors, kind people, few regular customers in their own tables. i recommend!"
yet another excellent dining experience on our recent visit to arnh 
"ive been coming here each week for the last year. excellent food, good portions, always freshly cooked and great service. not to mention reasonable prices. simply the best turkish restaurant in arnhem."
"went to ark after a long flight. co worker got the the meatball appetizer which was very good, shish lamb kebab not so much. it was okay but not seasoned much. overall a good meal but a little pricey. i had the stir fry mushroom appetizer. not worth the cost. beef kebab was a lot more bland than the meatball and fell short of expectations. a solid meal all around and they take credit cards including amex which is a plus. service was a little slow but there was only 1 server for the 20 or so tables so its understandable. "
"very pleased with my first meal in arnhem. having previously run out of another restaurant because we didnt like the look of it we came across this place. the staff were very welcoming, they tried sitting us at some bad tables but if you keep walking with authority you can sit around the corn "
"we arrived in arnhem around 4pm on a sunday evening. we stayed at hotel downtown with no restaurant. we were walking around looking for some place to eat but most places were closed due to the time and day of the week. this restaurant was open but we were apprehensive as we did not speak the language nor did the staff speak english. the owner was very friendly however. we chose food from the menu by guessing. the food was fantastic and plentiful! we ended up with a baked spaghetti, a shrimp dish with an excellent sauce, two different kebab dishes which also had very good sauces. everything was delicious and reasonably priced. we did have difficulty getting the attention of the waitress when we wanted more water however."
"tasteful dishes, good choice, rich in quantity, music in style with the restaurant but not too loud. today too often music seems to be a pleasure for the staff, not for the public. window seats offer a view of shopping people, a pleasure as well. close by public transport and parking garage."
amazing setting and wonderful food. i tried a variety of dishes and all of them were great. the staff were very friendly and helpful. this was a lovely restaurant up there with the best in arnhem for sure.
we had nasi rames and nasi kuning. taste was good with excellent service.  we had dinner on teras. which  was good. food had original taste
we got a small rijsttafel here. service was good and the food was amazing. the decor was fun to see. wish we had places like this back home in the us.
"this is wonderful landmark restaurant with an authentic atmosphere with very friendly and attentive, international staff in the heart of arnhe "
"nice welcoming atmosphere, friendly people, looks like run by a family. they could use some more people working there because sometimes you need to wait a bit. but food course was super, for a good price."
"we had a slightly long wait before our orders were taken. we almost walked out. so glad we didn‚Äôt! the food was delicious ‚Äî full of flavour, but not too spicy (perfect for someone like me who isn‚Äôt very good with spicy food). staff were very helpful and very friendly. i highly recommend this restaurant. one warning, though, the toilets are not very accessibl "
"fantastic food, surpassed all my expectations. friendly staff and good atmosphere. ive waited 20 years for an indonesian meal like this. we live in norway and went to the netherlands for a kulinaric extended weekend. the indonesian ricetable was the grand finally of our trip. all happy faces and no disappointmentüëçüëçüëç"
we had the batavia rijsttafel and it was good. very good favours and variety. the portion sizes were well judged as there was more than enough but not too much. a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant and good and friendly service. it is very popular. it was full when we arrived for our reservation at 19.00.
"we phones this restaurant to order some vegetarian indonesian dishes, which were delivered punctual and tasted very nice. portions were opulent, so we could reheat the leftovers the next day and still have a full meal. great!"
"i really enjoyed my dinner at batavia: cozy atmosphere, welcoming staff and amazing food.  the beef i ordered was delicious.  totally recommend!"
my wife and i struck gold when we stepped into this restaurant. it has a very nice indonesian look to it with all the wood carving. the staff was very welcomin 
we ordered a rijstafel batavia and it was a tasty roundhouse kick through the indonesian flavours(overall 16 little dishes). the restaurant is quite beautiful and the staff and owner are nice people. the service was also pretty good and fast.they realy try to make your stay pleasant.overall a joyfull experience which i would recommend to everyone who visits arnheim and wants to try out the indonesian cuisine.
"we had really nice nasi goreng ayam jawa en chicken curry, seated at the best table in the place: beside the window with good ambience and lighting. the ‚Äúrustig aan‚Äù and patience was worth it! <3"
right across the central station. courteous staff and good food. went there for lunch and had some really good indonesian food. couple of good options for vegetarians as well. which is nice.
"they serve tasty traditional indonesian food. we are really glad that weve spent the new years eve 2019 there! the service was really great, always eager to give an advice about the dishes they serve. the indonesian bintang beer was also very worth recommending!"
"return there every month for the classic indonesian food in a really nice indonesian atmospher, walls with bamboo, garudas complement the indonesian feel. like the sate kambing and the mixed sate plate, also the dish with the lon tong rice have nice terrace in front where you can see the people who walk from the station and buss area to the centre"
on globus tour staying  
"we visited batavia on a very busy night - had to join a queue - which might account for the lapses in service. the food was fantastic - recommend the skewers of goat meat and the prawn omelette (quite different from a chinese prawn omelette). we found it necessary to signal for a waiter for standard functions such as obtain a menu, order meals,later request cutlery after meal was delivered. our main meals were delivered before the starters ... all a bit chaotic that night, but staff universally friendly and polite."
"considering a table of 20 pre booked the drinks were served quickly and food orders taken quickly as well.we all chose the vegie combi at 19 euros,which was good value and food.excelent helpful staff.highly recommend."
"went over with my father and a couple of his old freinds last week for the 75th celebrations, this place was reccomended by one of them and it didnt dissapoin "
"it was splended! friendly personeel  we ordered menu for 6 persons. the drinks were in time.we were there more than 2,5 hour. time flies."
really enjoyed the food - the menu focuses on a number of banquet multicourse items; we had one and the plates offered (really only tapas style sizes) were delicious. location is the only downside (next to the busy main road by the station) but this is a very small criticism. recommended
a great choice for dinner when visiting arnhe 
"years ago we discovered batavia and it reminded us instantly of a holiday we had spent on sumatra. the food of course, but also the atmosphere and the people. we have been back many times and each time feels like a mini-vacation to the emerald islands."
"the food here doesnt disappoint. we were here for a week long business trip and had dinner here twice again. bami goreng, fried rice, spicy pork, beef rendang, and sambal fried potatoes is now on our must order list. simply top notch food to satisfy your asian food craving"
i have no clue why this place isn‚Äôt always rammed with hungry dutch. every single time i have been here i (& colleagues) have had a cracking meal. try the nasi goreng dwaja. amazing. very reasonable prices too
i have never been in indonesia but my friends recommended this place and i was a good decision. the food and the service are great! very recomendable!
"we had dinner 2 times here while we were here for a 4 day long business trip. even on a full house day, the food was served quickly. the food was good especially the daging rendang. great place to cure any craving for asian food"
"we came here for lunch to relive the tastes of indonesia and were not disappointed.  the food was excellent and the staff polite, friendly and helpful and an opportunity to use a few words of bahasa again.  will definitely make a return visit"
"having lived 5 years in jakarta, i sometimes feel nostalgic and look for indonesian restaurants, often to be disappointed. not this time. all was authentic, the sate dishes had just the right flavor, and the home made sambal was as hot as it should be. the decor and atmosphere is very attractive and the service efficient and polite. i‚Äôll be back."
"we had a great evening. staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice. but the food, that was extremely good. very tasty, and a good variety of dishes. the best indonesian ive had so far"
"absolut one of the best restaurants in europe. great taste, great crew, great restaurant.   warm welcome from the crew and lovely atmosphere. traditional taste from indonesia."
"a restaurant near the station serving indonesian food, nice ambience and friendly staff, very fast service. they have different rejistafel (including a vegetarian option); we tried the one called indonesian that is the smallest but still quite abundant for two. it was really delicious, and the price is definitely cheap. they accept credit cards."
"nice ambiance and staff. it was very busy therefore a bit noisy, however the food was very delicious. well balanced authentic flavors."
"great and fun times ! cheers üçªü•Ç food was good and also the staff is lovely , thanks allot and see young soon ;)"
"my friends and i were visiting bronbeek museum in arnhem. after a long day at the museum, we went back to the arnhem centrum and tried to find something to eat. one of my friends wanted to eat indonesian food. im, as an indonesian, very particular with indonesian food. we finally went to batavia restaurant, and i was surprised that the meals were delicious with the authentic tastes. the waitresses and the owner are also very friendly. it made the time we spent in arnhem so memorable!"
"staff were super friendly and the food was very good. serving size were really big for the menu. we ordered the grilled menu, and we could only finish half of the portion. good value for the money. was there for my birthday,and they played birthday song from djamrud and gave me extra spekkoek with small fire-spark, loved  "
"i went there with my parents and liked the place a lot. the food was tasty, spicy as we wanted and served quickly. big recommendation to all!"
"my husband has been talking about rijsttafel (dutch for rice table) for years, so when we arrived in holland, we kept our eyes peeled for indonesian restaurant "
"we ordered #4 group meal and it was very nice. service was good, very friendly if a tad slow.  price was pretty good - ‚Ç¨70 for three people including drinks."
"i think this is one of the best indonesian restaurant that you can find in the netherlands, ive almost tried every single food in there and so far i can tell that the food taste exactly like my mom cook back then in indonesia and my latest favourite thing about this restaurant is the decoration. it feels like im in indonesia everytime i was eating there, from the music and little decoration like the painting or statues theyre just looked great. that is why i highly reccomened this restaurant if you live or visit arnhem."
i am indonesian myself and gotta admit that the food here is really authentic like the one i had in my country. i recommends their signature nasi goreng madura or rijstafel istimewa. will surely coming back here everytime im in the netherlands.
"netherlands are known for their indonesian cuisine. havibg travelled around the country, i found batavia standing out and to be the best. their chicken skewers are just very delicious, ricetafel was too much for 2 people, but we were allowed to take home. friendly staff and service. i went back again for the chicken skewers and soup a few days after dining there. definitely a great recommendation! very affordable for a good meal. coffee or tea from the house made us feel special. "
excellent knowledge of what is gluten free and the needs of those of us who medically require gluten free! had an excellent meal and will go back! would thoroughly recommend!
been to this particular restaurant each and every time i am in netherlands.   my favorite and never disappoints.   in fact i am always in the love ok out for anyindonesian restaurants whilst traveling in europe and us and so far have not found better.
"good and authentic indonesian food, affordable price, excellent service. the owner is really nice and hospitable to us"
"very busy and crowded restaurant on a saturday. 1st time we visited and the service at our table was not great. we know this because 2 other tables who came in later were served before us. we had to wait 1,5 hour before the main order arrived... if it was fine dining we would not mind. anyway, the food totally made up for it, we ate it all! i mean after all we were starving and waited a long time for our food. the sate‚Äôs were so tender and well prepared, the rendang was super delicious. the sate kabing i‚Äôd rate a 9, near perfect. but my friends rated the sate babi a full 10. tip, if you are very hungry, dont order a rijsttafel, order sate, rice with rendang. by the way did i mention, they forgot our white rice?? so before we could finally eat we had to wait(again). i think we were unlucky because there was nothing wrong with the fo "
ive never had indonesian food before so i decided to give it a try. wow. the food is fantastic! the menu says spicy but its spicy from a taste standpoint not spicy hot.if you are here for a few days give this restaurant a try
"we had dinner in batavia restaurant last week, as indonesian visitor im glad to find the indonesian cuisine in arnhem and i definitely recommended this restaurant to whom may missed the indonesian food, the food taste is authentic indonesia foo "
"i would go back. the place was packed at 8.00 on a friday night suggesting the locals like it. we really enjoyed the food - we had the rijs tafel which was varied, tasty and very generous. the service was very patchy and the wine list was white, red or rose! we settled for beer after one glass of the wine. we had a great night and i would go back."
"very good buffet served quickly.excelent authentic dishes ,not to spicy .helpful staff.we hadnt booked but they found us a good table and we were rather late as i think the dutch eat early//would return if we come back to arnhem"
"as an indonesian student in arnhem, this is the place to go to eat great indonesian food. the price is okay, and the taste is very traditional which is amazing."
"to have a change from the pizza, fries etc we opted for indonesian good. we enjoyed it and had nasi rames n gulai kambing. a bit spicy but nice portion! service with a smile and reasonable priced. well be back"
"i study in arnhem , and ended up eating at this restaurant when my parents came to visi "
made it to arnhem after landing that morning in brussels and sight seeing all day. wanted something good and a relaxing atmosphere. batavia fit the bill. nice sidewalk seat to enjoy a leisurely dinner and drinks. i had the saffron rice combination and it was very good with a variety of dishes. more than i could eat. very nice first real meal on my trip. 
"i have lived in england for nine years and like a good curry.  but this was far better.  my pictures do not do the taste justice.  have the prawns, red snapper, and stir fried noodles!!!"
"i visited this indonesian restaurant with a business associate for dinner. neither of us had tried indonesian food before, and thought it would be a good idea to try it while in the netherlands, because it used to be a dutch colony, so it should be authentic. we were pleased, the food was very good and it is always nice to try something new. we ordered the rijstafel which was a combination of about 10 small dishes and rice. recommended."
being 25% indonesian i always try to eat this type of food in the netherlands. i tried the food twice and would give it a 7 with 10 being the best. not bad but feeling that the drive is a bit gone. gado gado was good but the vegetable could be a bit more crispy. i would come back but know better places in amsterdam/utrecht (blauw) and of course at the pentagon and lucky plaza mall in singapore.
"if you happen to visit arnhem and like ethnic food, you shouldnt miss this one! its located straight in front of the station, its impossible to not notice it. you can have a whole long tray of food to share in two at a very low price. its trademark: the sat√©!"
"on vacation in the neighbourhood we checked the ratings on batavia and made a reservation for sunday night. we are both indonesian food lovers and have tasted it in many different places in holland, belgium and in asia ( singapore, jakarta, bali et "
had lunch on sunday here after reading the reviews. good food and friendly service.  we tried the vegetarian menu for two which comprised of 10 little plates of various recipes - nice sampler and teasing of taste bugs. very convenient location
"have been to this loveley restaurant many times over the years, last visit was july 2016, and looking forward to visiting again on thursday 11th may. very friendly staff, excellent service, and the food is fantastic, looking forward to seeing julia and all the staff again soon. hugs from your airborne brothers and friends. charlie, jhonno, and mark. we arrived slightly later on our last night having booked a table for around 1900 hrs finally getting there after 2300 hrs as they were closing, but they still served us a drink, and a full meal."
if you are into indonesian food and rijsttafel this is the place to be in arnhem. it has a friendly atmosphere and good service and the food is good. the place is however still as it was 30 years ago. it could use some innovation and maybe the addition of some fusion. i have seen some very good fusion cooking in new york. new recipes should not replace the traditional food but to add some modern flavors. batavia is very traditional in food an interiour. but on the other hand the place is doing well. it was packed the evening i visited. so lot of people still enjoy the traditional style of decorations and food.
if you never have been to indonesia and still want to taste the food. come to arnhem and visit batavia restaurant. straight across the central station is this authentic indonesian restaurant where the staff has a typical indonesian hospitality and the cooks know what they doing. choose one of their excellent  rijsttafels
we ordered the vegetarian rijstafel for two. twelve different dishes appeared and we thought we wouldnt eat it all. how wrong we were. we demolished the lot because all the flavours were fabulous and complimented each other. this was my first rijstafel and it was a taste explosion. the staff were helpful and attentive and the food delicious.
good authentic indonesion food. its not without a reason they have been there for several decades in arnhem.
"my boyfriend who was in town and i stumbled upon this indonesian restaurant the other day. as indonesians, we cant believe how much this place feels like home; the decor gives off a very traditional javanese vibe. we ordered the beef rendang, ayam rica-rica (a tad spicy) and tahu telur which were all great. truly a home far away from home."
"this restaurant offers traditional indonesian kitchen (this not like chinese indonesian restaurants you find everywhere in netherlands with offer european tasting food...). service is good, employees very friendly. you can find indonesian food here like in indonesia. not far (walking distance) from arnhem central station, advised to park in parking garage under station."
was on a business trip and looked for a restaurant for dinner following advice of tripadvis 
"this place was a surprise, the atmosphere inside is very typical, staff are very funny and friendly, and the food is delicious... the price is not bad, and portions are quite big. is a good place to join a big group of friends or for a romantic dinner with someone special."
"a very nice place with great, friendly service and very good food of authentic taste! very close to central station and cultural venues."
nice place but the service could have been faster. i was on my own so felt like i was forgotten a little bit . the different meat dishes were very interesting though!
"the place is usually packed, so get in there in before the shops close or make a reservation. ignore the buffet and just sit down and order one of the many great indonesian rice tables on the menu. my last visit here i sat down with 3 friends from out of town and had a great time. friendly waiters & delicious food, what else do you need? we even got offered a free cup of coffee at the end, which we unfortunatly had to decline because my friends had a train to catch. heartily recommend a visit."
"all the food are terribly good. from sayur lodeh to sate kambing, it is so surprising to have this kind of indonesian food in netherlands. some food even better than some restaurant in indonesian. i will be back for sure also for the food, caring service and romantic traditional decoration. it was worth it to wait for 30 minutes for a table."
"you can‚Äôt go to netherlands and not eat indonesian. batavia was a good choice. it was a 10 minute walk from our b&b. we split an appetizer, had 2 drinks and ordered rice main courses (‚Ç¨50)."
"the location is so cool because the restaurant stay in the center, next to the station.very good ambiance & food.  the waiters are so friendly.                     very good place!!!"
"if you want to have a touch of indonesia and true indonesian food this restaurant is a must......its like being in batavia (in the restaurant) and only 5 minutes walking from the fantastic new railway and bus station. good food; nice music, nice waitresses....what more can one ask for."
"really great place, everything was great. food was fresh and tasty, service was good, and the people where very friendly. defiantly would go and recommend!"
"well, we liked it. our kids didnt find anything they liked, but i am not sure whether i can blame the restaurant - our kidsare like that... anyway, we had a nice dinner, what i would complain about is the ratherstraightforward service and the appearance of the food. i have no idea of dutch price levels, but it seemed on the pricier side. dont get me wrong though, id return immediately..."
"located near to the station and close to a variety of bars we visited this restaurant to sample indonesian food. three of our party (of four) had not eaten at an indonesian restaurant before. we were welcomed and were able to book a table and return later to eat. our waitress assisted us in choosing a banquet menu with starters, soup and 16 main courses - all excellent. although 16 courses the quantity of food was just right and provided a good balance. we were very impressed and would return. a very nice evening in traditional surroundings with very good food."
everything is very good and we have enjoyed ourselves very much! the staffs are very friendly and helpful! we like the atmosphere too! must come to dine here again!
being not very familiar with indonesian food this restaurant was a great find. we had a rijstafel and must say it was delicious. the service was great and very attentive.
"arnhem is not noted as a foodie destination, but if you find yourself there for an evening you cant do much better than batavia. very close to the station, batavia offers some of the best indonesian food i have had in the netherlands, and i have had a lot. well worth a visit, but make sure to book. it is very popular."
real indonesian food java style. some dishes are just like mi aunt and granny cooked. dont go for the buffet but try the specialties. friendly staf also they made sambal kecap for me which is not on the menu.
"during my 3 week stay in arnhem, there were only two restaurants which i alternated for dinner everyday. one was batavia and the other was an indian restaurant. prior to tasting indonesian cuisine at batavia, i had no idea how indonesian food tasted. i had arrived late from amsterdam by train and barely had 30 minutes to check-in to my hotel and head for dinner. thankfully i was only a few minutes away from this wonderful restaura "
"not quite a 4, but it would be unfair to rate it 3. positives: tasty food (sate bali to start, spicy noodles for main). nice white wine. good beer.  negatives: service was slow, especially the wait for the main course. decor:kitsch.  reasonable value for money."
"nice indonesian restaurant for both families and business meetings. right in the city center and close to parking and the central station.  service is very good and friendly, food is good as well."
real old fashioned rijsttafel. we had so many different dishes whith each √† different taste. especially the sate was excellent. there was also √† delicious soto ajam soup served
"always crowded and yet a very cosy atmosphere. i was there (again...) last saturday with some friends and enjoyed the buffet-meal (only in weekends). you get soto and satehs served at your table and afterwords you choose from the buffet as many times as you like. i just love the sateh, especially the makassar sat "
we found this restaurant on tripadvisor and decided to give it a try. we dined a few days ago and had a ricetable. it was out of this world. we have never eaten such delicious indonesian meal before and will definitely come back when we are in arnhem. the staff are friendly and attentive. everything was perfect.
we had dinner. food was delicious and fresh made. the staff was very attentive and friendly. we had a great time and we will definitivly come back and recommend batavia.
followed the tripadvisor recommendation and tried this restaurant... not disappointed. the satay grill was excellent with more than enough to eat for one!
"when we go to the netherlands we always go for a indonesian meal if we can. found batavia 100 metres from our hotel, and as it was sunday decided on the buffet. all the items tasted fantastic, our favourite being a beef rendang. we were spoilt for choice- there are loads of different dishes, including salads, rice and mains. if youre a glutton like me, youll get your moneys worth!"
"my ladyfriend from indonesia was traveling around in europe for a week and has to eat european food almost 7 days. when she arrived in our house in arnhem she told me to have then real indonesian meals special sate. we booked a dinner for 4 persons in batavia restaurant and ordered the  sate menu. it was a marvelous dinner i ever gave to my guests in the netherlands. the sate were very tender and good spicy, the side meals like rice are really cooked like our mother used to cooked back ho "
this restaurant is very close to the arnhem central station. weve visited this restaurant twice and both the times the food were very tasty. the owner was really friendly and even recommended which dish night suit to our taste bud. the only set back was the slow service. id highly recommend this restaurant based on the taste. 
i took my sons to arnhem from n.z. and suggested a nice rice meal sis said batavia  it was a perfect choice great meal great service and nice surrounding
"i am an experienced journalist with a love of dining, although i am, i admit, less than a gourmet. i first tasted and fell in love with, dutch-indonesian cooking decades ago. i and my wife, who does know fine cuisine, enjoyed this restaurant. the service of a stylish and tasty vegetarian rijsttafel, by a javanese woman, in this well-appointed, clean and atmospheric resto was delightful. im not sure ill be able to repeat the experience elsewhere in the netherlands, let alone in england, where we live. but id love to. ‚Äì david altheer, london"
my second time to batavia. first time went with my brother and the second time with my m 
"lovely place, fully booked but we could walk in for a quick bite with wonderful food, a lot of it and a very nice any friendly hostess."
this is small quaint restaurant. you are always made welcome and sitting at the back under the canopys is really lovel 
my previous visit was in 1996. the meal then was excellent. i was pleased to find that in 2015 the restaurant - now operated by the son of the original owner - is as good as ever. a most enjoyable meal.
we decided to go here for dinner due to the recommendations on tripadvisor - we were not disappointed. our waitress was lovely; she had studied in the uk and had visited edinburg 
"last week we opted for this restaurant because we wanted to have an indonesian dinner for a change. it is visited by locals and visitors alike and is very popular. nice atmosphere, friendly staff and we enjoyed our bami and rijsttafel very much, everything was very tasteful. after dinner we were offered a complimentary coffee. taxi just outside, very convenient. we will be back"
"we went here during our visit in arnhem. we ordered a menu for 2 which included starter and main dish for about 22‚Ç¨/person, drink separately. the staff were friendly, it seemed though that one of them wasnt that good at english, the place was rather dark but pretty cosy, not many people there during our visi "
"amazing meal for 2. the staff helped us out and we went for their recommendation, which was great. a lot of small dishes so we got to try a lot of different flavors. price seemed very reasonable considering how good the food wa "
"if you want a fun evening with great food, and friendly and attentive staff, you will not be disappointed here. we went on a sunday evening and had their smallest ricetable menu. the place was buzzing and there was more than enough food for the 11 of us in the party. thank you batavia crew, we will be back."
"excellent service, amazing food, ultra friendly staff and owners. we have had lots of indonesian food before (we are a new zealander and a sumbawan) but this was the greatest. when in arnhem do as we did and go straight to the batavia for your dinner and i hope you love it as we did both times."
visited with 5 other cyclists. staff were very helpful and provided us with english menus. the waitress in charge made minor recommendations to our order such as what rice to order. we followed her recommendations and were not disappointed! a lovely meal and pretty good value. we would recommend this place
"came with my mother and sister visiting from canada to try some indonesian cuisine. food was flavorful, great spices, tender meats and great service. we recommend the goat or the beef dishes. we chose a 5 course menu to sample a lot of dishes and were not disappointed - recommended for first timers."
"we were delighted with the food and presentation. coming from the united states where indonesian food is hard to find, this was a treat. service a+. we had waiter from portugal who never stopped working, he truly loves seeing customers enjoying the uniqueness of this cuisine. the owners expressed gratitude for choosing their place to dine as we left, highly recommend for those looking for an experience different from the norm."
the netherlands doesnt really seem to have a national cuisine so theyve adopted indonesian food as their go to choice for a great meal out. they were the colonial masters of indonesia for centuries and rijsttafel is the national di 
"this restaurant is one of the best indonesian restaurant in arnhem. we enjoyed the rendang, sate andd nasi kuning. must visit! regards, yurdi"
"my husband and i went here last night. we had the weekend buffet. chicken soup, 2 types pork satay and then unlimited buffet. good selection of meat, vegetable, rice and other sauces and accompaniments. staff were all very friendly and eager to ensure we had a good time. meal was ended with complimentary tea or coffee. we were able to choose from an english menu. the restaurant was busy even at 1730-1830 but staff kept their very professional manner and coped well. thankyou for a very enjoyable experience. "
as a first experience of indonesian cuisine we enjoyed our meal. we chose one of their starter menus and were not disappointed and left the restaurant very full and satisfied . the service was excellent- friendly and helpful and the teas or coffees on the house at the end was a good touch.
"great service, great food, cozy atmosphere! entering the restaurant you get a true warm feeling of indonesia...warm asian hospitality"
"this restaurant is conveniently located in the city center. i took my girl on a date here and it was fantastic! the atmosphere is very warm, cozy and comfortable. the food was exquisite and the staff really make you feel at home. this is definitely one of the best restaurants in arnhem, and they will make you love indonesian food!"
"went to batavia with a work colleague one night. neither of us had ever eaten indonesia food, so had to get some guidance from the staff on what to ea "
the best indonesian in town the batavia set meal is really excellent and we shall be there again the staff sare slso very friendly
as a regular customer for years i consider it a privilege to review batavia. the atmosphere is traditional indonesian and julia is a perfect hostess. during weekends they serve an excellent buffet dinne 
"ive never had indonesian food before so i have no way of comparison, but ultimately the food was delicious, tasty, with the right amount of spice (and the portions were generous). not being able to read dutch we went for a mixed grill platter overflowing with little pieces of meat (various animals) on skewers, ribs, some veggies and a fried plantain. was given a doggy-bag with complimentary fried-rice: they found the way to my heart. staff was friendly and the atmoshpere is relaxed. overall a good spot. i shall return."
this might be my new favorite spot in arnhem! they have a ‚Ç¨16.90 3-course javanese buffet deal that will blow your min 
"we had dinner here tonight because eva, a friend, had recommanded this pla "
you know the food is good when elder indonesians walk in for a meal. this is truly tempo doeloe. the sate kambing (goat) is heaven. when in arnhem go to batavia and indulge to lose yourself in an excellent genuine indisch experience.
"we loved our visit to restaurant batavia in arnhem. the food was delicious and authentic, the service was excellent and overall really happy to dine here. decoration was beautiful, makes us feel were dining in indonesia! well definitely come back when were in arnhem again. great recommendation to dine here. thank you tripadvisor. "
"among the four indonesian restaurants in arnhem, batavia is the oldest, biggest and serve the most authentic indonesian cuisines. the decor of this restaurant doesnt even change much since they opened. and what a decor! it is unmistakably indonesian. no wonder they have the biggest loyal customers."
"i have been to batavia many times already and i would go back without a doubt. food is good, portions are big and we are always warmly welcom "
"we ordered a meal that is served in ample dishes, 3 different flavors of meat. very yammy and satisfying. got a taste of 8 different kind of dishes with the price of one. interesting new experience for people who are looking for a different experience."
on our way to koln two of us from india visited this restaurant in search of some close to home food.. we had a lovely lunch with delicious indonesian food..its a must visit place..behaviour of the people is very nice and friendly.
"i went there as a solo business traveler based on the critics of tripadvisor. the welcoming was very warm from the waiter. i didnt know the plates so i asked for suggestions in order to discover the indonesian cuisine. i was offered the menu that includes appetizers and many small dishes as main plates, which was delicious. to conclude, very good staff, very good food and i would definitely recommend this restaurant."
what a joyful experience our dinner at the batavia was! we cannot recommend this restaurant warmly enou 
"holland has a tradition with indonesian food, for indonesia has been a dutch colony for many years. there are many chinese restaurants who also serve indonesian meals, but it is not the real indofood we like up here. this restaurant is very good, try the sat√© menu. it is outstanding."
"been here twice to have dinner with some indonesian and european friends. all of them loved the foods. at first we were blown away by the warmth of the javanese decoration in this place with the whole paintings, angklung, wayang, etc. rendang and udang batavia were recommended menu to try. i was just wondering if they serve a real padangnese food with the whole sambal padang and everything else. that would be awesome!"
"we wandered in. he liked the decor, she liked the menu. we ordered two very different dinners and traded bites. we will go back. note: people in a hurry may be disconcerted at the pace. hungry people who want to sit and chat and pass an hour or two will enjoy themselves. "
"what i missed most from indonesia after a few months away is the food, and i was very excited the first time i saw a familiar name of the restaurant. the staff was very welcoming and suddenly we found that the atmosphere was very homy since they use javanese decoration. the food was great, even though we think that it was too much."
we had not booked on a november monday evening but the restaurant was not busy. it seems to be run by a family who are very welcoming and the walls are decorated with indonesian wood carvings. we had the 5 course menu which really was too much for us but means that you can taste many different dishes. some are quite spicy but all very interesting. the staff are very attentive and also genuine indonesian beer is served. if you like this type of food in a pleasant atmosphere then you should visit when in arnhem.
"following the ratings on ta, we chose batavia for a friday evening dinner. i considered myself warned by the reviews about the restaurant being full and slow, so i made a reservation and prepared myself for the wait. but when we got there, our table was waiting for us with some fish cracklings on the table. drinks were served right away, and soup was served piping hot after a few minutes. main course (rijsttafel) was served within reasonable time and i found the flavors splendid! but you have to be familiar with asian taste to appreciate it. i can imaging that for other people, they might find it too spicy (like my 2 year old daughter, but she loved the fried bananas! "
"i have visited this restaurant many times over about thirty years. this was my first return for 9 years and i was not disappointed. the best rice table in holland, probably europe. try it for authentic javanese cooking in a friendly atmosphere."
"batavia, located in bustling arnhem center, features not only tasty indonesian food, but the service and staff are friendly and helpful. we ordered the set menu for 4 and got an array of dishes pleasantly arranged in small indonesian platters -- like a tasting -- but very plentiful. there is an outside terrace and the interior is completely decorated in darkened and carved teak wood, a bit oppressive to me, but my dining mates thought it was cool. . . in any case, the food was good!"
"service is really friendly. you feel welcome from the moment you enter. the restaurant is beautiful decorated, with nice private corners. it is easy to park in de parking garage under the train station, which is across the street. they have a large menu with a lot of indonesian choice "
"this has been my fourth visit to batavia in the past 27 years. yes, first visit was back in 1986. every travel to netherlands included a dinner in batavia. it has been 10 years since last visit so had some doubts whether quality is kept. it was great to find out that things are still the same. warm welcome and pleasant atmosphere are still here. ordered of course rijsttafel for the four of us. starters were awesome and variety of dishes that followed were great. service could be more attentive. will come back the next time in the netherlands. "
"this place is frequented for over 40 years on a regulas basis. being lovers of indonesian food its unfortunately the only acceptable place left in the surrounding of arnhem. the quality is good, well-organized staffs and certainly enjoyable for asian food lovers. the owners are professionals in this niche of indonesian food specialties. certainly well-recommended."
"not only is the food phenomenal but the service and staff go beyond the call of duty. we had missed our last train to utrecht when we wandered by batavia just after closing. on a whim, we tapped on the window and asked if there would be any possibility to order something. they were more than gracious. they invited us in on their off time and cooked up a storm of vegetarian delights. it was delicious! but it didnt end there, they let us stay and we chatted most of the night, telling stories and sharing our experiences. they took us under their wing and treated us with warmth and kindness and were happy to have us stay until our early morning train was up and ready to go. being travellers, myself from canada and my boyfriend from slovakia, weve met many wonderful and warm people but this bunch were at the top of our list. we couldnt have asked for a more wonderful way to spend the night. thank you batavia!!!"
"im an indonesian student from university of wageningen. i have lived in netherlands for almost one year. yesterday i came to arnhem to visit a friend and at that time i really wanted to eat indonesian food. i asked my friend if she knows a good indonesian restaurant somewhere in arnhem. she said that there is one of the best indonesian restaurant in the city called batavia. she made me very curious and we went there straightly. when i first came into the front door, i saw a magnificent interior design of the restaurant. it really feels like my hometown in yogjakarta. moreover, the foods are very typical indonesia and the prices are very affordable for students. batavia has fulfilled my desire and im definitely going back there everytime i get homesick. its definitely a right choice to spend your time here! good atmosphere, good food, and good price!"
"authentic indonesian food in batavia, especially the satay macassar (quote spicy) with a wide choice of dishes. friendly service, highly recommended."
"fairly formulaic indonesian, but food generally tasty and enjoyable, at reasoble prices."
"very friendly people. best indonesian food in town. lovely atmosphere. interior old fashioned, but thats part of the experience."
"outstanding restaurant. good food, great service  worth coming back in future. i have eaten in many indonesian restaurant in arnhem and central area, this is the best. find julia when you are there, she is the best host in the restaurant.  greetings from mexico"
really nice restaurant with a great atmosphe 
"we visited again recently and glad to say that this small charming restaurant still offers a good meal and good service. gluten free options also available. staff polite friendly and helpful. while we had not booked we were early enough to get a table, but later on during the evening, people were being turned away. so perhaps at the weekend safer to book a table. prices reasonable for two people with starters, mains, 3 glasses of wine desert and 1 coffee 71 euro."
a real treat if you enjoy tasty french bistro fo 
"have visited this restaurant twice and it was very good both times. while there is nothing specifically gluten free on the menu, they are happy to adapt or use an alternative ingredient(s) i.e. a sauce, for example. they were coming to the end of the hunting season, but they trio was still available and was an excellent choice - hare, venison, and boar, tender and succulent. 3 glasses of wine, a main course, a desert, 35 eur "
"you have to know where it is but this is really a nice little restaurant to visit, nice food and friendly staff."
huge and delicious!!!1! also onion soup was very nice. if you like good quality food for reasonable price this is a place for you.
"great place to eat very friendly food was lovely we booked for our first night having read previous reviews, we enjoyed it so much didnt look for any where else on 2nd night we just went back"
"i have been here before as i sometimes come over for business and like to have a change from the hotel food. i had my father with me this time and he said he would like a steak. we were not disappointed, it was a lovely warm evening so we ate at one of the outside tables watching the world go by. the food was beautiful, a very tender and tasty steak with a bottle of wine served by a very friendly chap, sorry cant remember your name. a perfect evening to remember with my dad!"
"ordered ribs like many, and they were tender, tasty, well done. not sauced much (my preference) but maybe marinated and clearly with a dry rub spicing. simply done and simply delicious. good crusty white bread, nice light home fries, a chpped green salad (ok dutch style isnt my favorite salad, but it was ok) and a very good slaw all come with. a bargain for 15.50 e, considering it was a rack + of lean meaty ribs. ate outside on a gorgeous evening and the service was professional and brisk, but not hurried. too full after only a main to even consider dessert, but the cappuccino i finished with was perfect with a lovely, botany fo "
"a very familiar and friendly atmosphere for this nice restaurant in arnhem. the food was simple and well prepared, we all liked it very much."
"we visited this bistro three times during our stay in arnhem,we had different food each time and we enjoyed each meal the lamb chops were delicious the king prawns amazing and tonight the filet steak was cooked to perfection. the staff made us feel very special and very welcome. thank you we had a lovely visit to your city."
visited the restaurant with three friends on our recent trip to arnhem doing a ww2 trip. we all had the ribs and can confirm that they were excellent and plentiful along with the baked potatoes and salad. would certainly revisit.
"food was fine, however, dutch food is not as good as good uk restaurants. so my rating is a comparison against other dutch eateries. the service is friendly and polite and good."
"i found this gem when looking through tripadvisor, so i visited during a business trip to arnhem, i was greeted with a smile and shown towards a small table. the place was already busy which is a good sig "
"visited this restaurant on a wednesday night after reading the other reviews in this page. i ordered the french onion soup for starters and then the ribs for main. both were fantastic and the best that i have ever had. i received about 1.5 racks of ribs, plus potatoes salad and bread. there was so much i did not eat it all, which is not like me. the staff were very friendly and welcoming. nice place and would definitely go back."
"two of us ate here before an opera performance at musis sacrum, schouwburg, arnhem. we walked around the shopping mall area and needed somewhere to eat. the tables on the stone patio looked inviting, and the staff were welcoming. the wines by the glass were simple but fine, and went well with the excellent bread and butter that came immediately. for dinner, we had a salmon filet and a steak. both were prepared well, with flavorful sauces. there was a cold vegetable salad for two, and the most amazing fried potatoes i have had in the netherlands. i dont know what made them superior to every other dutch potato, but they were crisp and golden on the outside but creamy on the interior, nicely salted and bursting with potato flavor and nothing else. the meal was very reasonably priced, and there was enough food that we did not want dessert afterwards."
"we went here on friday and both had the entrecote steak. they do seem to love garlic in this part of the world and there was a lot of garlic butter on it. the service was friendly, it was lovely sitting outside and all in all i really enjoyed the evening!"
i had spare ribs and my companions the sea trout (zalmforel) with prawns. huge portions (so i dont recommend a starter) and good service in this small but popular bistro located in a back street in the pedestrian area of arnhem. i recommend making a reservation for busy nights. we parked at the langstraat parking garage (which is quite tricky to get to - we paid ‚Ç¨6) and it was a 5 - 10 minute walk.
"excellent entrecote, with baked potatoes and side sauces. i really enjoyed the meal and the staff was very friendly. i recommend it and i would definitely come back!"
"just back from an amazing meal. the meat was so tender, the salad so fresh. the staff are warm and efficient and the chef is a magician. we simply cannot praise it enough. thank you so much."
"visited this one many times and never has been a disappointment. very good food for a reasonable price. especially when youre a meat-lover you must visit de bok. the service is very good, many other restaurants can learn from them."
"we spotted the restaurant while drinking in caf√© de beugel next door. the restaurant was very busy outside, but still plenty of seats available inside. the menu was limited, but every option was tempting. the food was superb and the service was warm, genuine and friendly. our group enjoyed the food some much we ended up eating there for three nights straight. while you wait for the starters the staff bring you fresh bread with a selection of tasty mayos. the onion soup, hot piri piri prawns and beef carpaccio were wonderful starters. additionally, the steaks, meat skewer and ribs were great. all cooked on charcoal fire in the corner of the restaurant. the wine list again is minimal. a house red and white then 3 other white and reds. we enjoyed a good south american red for about ‚Ç¨19. our group thoroughly enjoyed arnhem, but the welcome we received from the staff was stunning. i can not recommend this restaurant highly enough. if i go back to arnhem, this will be the restaurant for the first night."
"we looked for a good value place to eat something, not just a fastfood place. a waiter of a nearby pub advised us bok. and he was right. not a big choice of menu, but everything looked appealing. i had a steak, perfect. and very friendly personnel. very good value for money!"
we have been coming to arnhem for business & leisure for 3 years. we make a point of eating at de bok as often as we c 
"since more than 30 years, bistro de bok is located in the duizelsteeg, near the korenmarkt, arnhem. a small but fine place to be, where a great cook uses a charcoal-fire to prepare great meat and fish. great taste and nice people. best in town!"
"visited bosphorus restaurant with some friends who live in arnhem and they highly recommended it. i was a bit skeptical at first because the restaurant was almost empty. however the service was good and the appetizer we ordered, the sample dish i recall, was outstanding an enough for the three of us. at the recommendation of my friend i ordered a dish with beef and and vegetables with yogurt sauce and it was one of the best meals ive had in a turkish restaurant. exceptional food."
"this is a wonderful restaurant, the food is excellent, especially the starters and the vegetarian dishes and their pizza, according to the kids is yummy. the staff are friendly, helpful and make you feel really welcome. in the summer (if its warm) there is a beautiful terrace at the back of the restaurant. it really is a lovely place for a meal you can eat at your leisure in comfortable and inviting surroundings. i would definitely recommend it."
"great food, very friendly service and excellent authentic turkish food. wide array of choices on the menu. spacious restaurant and a nice terrace at the back of the restaurant when the weather is good. affordable prices and you really have to try the desserts! recommended when youre in the neighbourhood..."
the food was really good and the service quite fast and friend 
"this place is a good one. at the table there is good service and friendly staff, amd the food amazing. for me its around the corner, and i hope it stays that way. the takeaway offers the same great quality as the tableside food. truely recommended!"
"we ordered a lot of food for the whole family. all was very authentic chinese/ cantonese/ traditional chinese-indonesian style cuisine. we love the shrimps, the noodles, the fried chicken and chinese vegetables. guess well do takeaway again."

"our family of five, while traveling on our ho;land bike trip, came here during a rainstorm to get out of the rain and to enjoy some dutch pancakes. the pancake choices were many and what we picked were delicious. the staff was gracious to let us stay a little bit after our meal finished to wait out the rain. dennis most graciously encouraged our 73 year old dad who hadnt been feeling well to lie on the couch - an unusual act of caring that we will not forget and quickly made us to become your number one fans. hope we have the privilege of coming to this special place again that has everything good about the dutch people and food under one ro "
"we came for a quick lunch after our visit to the war museum. between a group of 5, we had some pancakes as well as the soup. everything was freshly prepared, well seasoned and served with a smile. all in all really good experience and highly recommend"
we found this place by chance when we went to a park nearby.  we had some crepes and coffees and they were amazing.  lovely selection of savory and sweet.....so delicious
"lovely pancakes! the straff was very friendly, nice to our little kid too. service was fast.  everything is just like you expect from a pancakes restaurant."
visited this restaurant the day restaurants were allowed to reopen again for guests! we were greeted by a very friendly and enthusiastic member of staff and could sit on the terrace. there was already a high chair there for our so 
"so many choices but i was delighted with mine, an apple pancake with honey, pine nuts, arugula, goat cheese and fresh figs. very reasonably priced."
arrived late in arnhem after traveling for hours and needed some good comfort food. we saw this and knew we had to stop. we were not disappointed. the waitstaff were very friendly and the food was great. we joked that we were celebrating our 30th anniversary and decided to go to the netherlands for pancakes. to our surprise they gave us a wrapped box of chocolates. its a shame this will a once-in-a-lifetime visit as we would gladly return.
we were stressed: so much choice in sweet or hearty pancakes. the filling was of a good size. and delicious.
"great food, minutes from the entrance to the park. we enjoyed the pannenkoeken, along with the friday night crowd, families, etc. a popular place."
"i wish i knew of this place when my friend came from london and was looking for a good pancake restaurant. the restaurant serves a yummy variety of pancakes both sweet and savory. it also has sandwiches and desserts. but we saw people queuing up only for pancakes. they also have heating for the outside sitting area adjacent to the restaurant, which we found very comfortable. there is nothing too fancy, but still quite fulfilling, especially if you are looking for pancakes. after a long walk in the forest, thats a good way to treat yourself!"
"if you are going to this place the kind of pancakes they make are really good. you can not try all of them at once, but for sure try 1 or 2 and you will know it yourself."
very tasty pancakes! friendly staff! cozy terrace with heaters. would definitely come back üòä üååüååüåå
"definitely the best pannenkoek i have ever had in the netherlands. normally, when i eat pannenkoek, i am fed up after a few bites. this was not at all the case in this restaurant. it was different from the usual pannenkoek, crunchy at the top and soft at the bottom. really delicious. a pity that the personnel there was not super friendly. highly recommended to families with children."
after visiting burgers zoo we went to den strooper. delicious panncakes with every ingredient you can imagine. friendly people and perfect for the kids
"great food, great drinks, great staff - no complaints! not in a busy location but has easy parking. definitely give the pancakes a go."
"stopped here for a quick drink - staff were very friendly, the place is very child friendly with a nice play area. although we didnt eat here, the menu had a wide variety of pancakes and the kitchen smelt yummy."
"found this place after travelling from den haag. isolated location, but lovely outside terrace to enjoy food in the sun. service somewhat slow. however, food excellent in both quality and quantity."
our 25th engagement anniversary trip. we had just visited the kruller mueller museum and taken a 25 kilometer bike ride through the pa 
"just pancakes in all kinds and sorts. ranging van simple au naturel to stacked with all kinds of meat and vegies.   like all dutch places, parents dont have any control over their kids."
a restaurant well worth a visit if you like pancak 
"thin, hot and filled with good things--like smoked salmon, asparagus and cheese on a savoury pancake smothered in apple syrup (the monthly special) or fresh peaches and cheese sprinkled with powered sugar; 30 cm across. who could ask for more. well cooked, promptly served. tricky to find, but if you have been to either the zoo or the open air museum, it is worth the effort."
"what can i say, it is located in the middle of forest pa "
"a fixture on all my trips to the netherlands, this pancake place is great. located near the entrance of the veluwezoom national park for a nice bike ride (on free white bikes) or the world-famous kroller - moller van gogh collection."
we came here with some dutch friends and absolutely loved it! their savory and sweet pancakes were very unique and delicious! highly recommend! staff were very fluent in english.
"the ambiance of this old farmhouse is great. the food is good and i did not realize that there were so many pancakes and toppings possible. try the pancake with salmon, my favorite."
this cafe is a dream. plenty seating inside. great service happy cheerful ones and staff. outside we saw the honey cone waffers they put on hot drinks their speciality so entered. sitting inside my wife had coffee it came with cream on top to drink through and a measure of liquor. we also had cake. all was excellent and like most people in arnhem they speak english and very pro english. dont miss this place l give it max star 
really chilled place in the heart arnhem. best place to have poffertjes. must if you are visiting the city.
we order the pofferjuets a dutch special of tiny pancakes with butter and powder sugar. these were fantastic. also enjoyed a freshly made stoopwaffle. both were delicious.
"stroopwafels is a typical dutch product. on a raining day, together with a cup of thee. nice lunch too.  and you can also buy a stroopwafel for take away!"
delicious fresh stroopwafels and great coffee. the staff very very welcoming and accommodating. highly recommend.
"we had warm, tasty, home made stroopwafels at this place, with a coffee. they also sell them out of a window at the street."
"the staff make any business and our waitress/hostess at de lunchclub was out of the top drawer - such a nice, friendly person. no wonder they were doing such good trade, at the inside tables as well as those outside in the sun on an early spring day. we chose light fare that was delicious and with out cuppas, we were given a welcome glass of amarula and cream too. i thoroughly recommend this small establishment in the heart of the old town, whatever the weather."
called in here on a day trip to arnhem. there were a number of other places around but all looked a bit much for a quick lunch. there is a reasonable selection and the friendly waitresses all speak english. i originally asked for a burger but got offered a ciabatta special which i had. it was perfect as was the apple pie for desert. i would stress if you dont like mayo you need to tell them because like most places in the netherlands they put mayo on most thin 
excellent location and friendly helpful staff. all food really good from salads to sandwiches . great selection of teas coffees and cakes. freshly made stroopwafels‚ò∫
"we go there very often and everytime get a surprise meal of experimental vegetarian dishes. the price is fixed and very reasonable. the place is small and popular, so always better to make a reservation beforehand. the people are very kind and nice. food is good. the ambient is cozy and homely. what else do you need for a perfect dining o "

i love the fact that they serve organic food and vegetarian food here. the service is awesome and food differs everyday. i just wish the place is a bit more spacious but then - we go there for a healthy grab so it doesnt matter
"i love mams! the meals are good, the coffee is pretty good. you can choose out of a lot of options. i come here often to study on the first floor, but it can be very noisy so i would avoid this cafe in the busiest houres to stud "
best coffee shop in arnhem. the cakes are delicious and perfect for a break from routin. for a better experience i recommend sharing ;)
"nice staff and good hot drinks and panninis. plenty of locals and not many tourists. staff spoke enough english to order. would recommend if needing a light bite, hot drink and sit down whilst in arnhem."
"stopped here during a beautiful road ride around the area. we both had decaf cappuccino and it was fabulous, definitely the best coffee i‚Äôve had in holland. i had apple pie and he had chocolate fudge cake.... omg both were incredible, great that the apple cake wasn‚Äôt spoilt by putting sultanas in, the crust was super short and crunchy. the choc cake was gooey, sticky and fabulou "
one of my favourite placets to get a good coffee and something healthy for lunch. a lot of variation in the food! staff is also really nice
"ive been to arnhem many times and mams coffee is one of my favourite cafes. location wise, it is very close to the central station and to the city centre as we "
"nice little sandwich place off willemsplein. they serve a variety of salads and sandwiches, coffee, tea and beer. good atmosphere for a quick bite at a good price."
"in general, it is a really cozy place. staff speaks good english so it wouldnt be a problem if you are international. you could also ask for a blanket if its cold outside. their desserts are okay. wraps are awesome and great quality. coffee is much better than at any other places and not expensive as well. staff needs to look out for not evenly cleaned cutlery when they serve food, a couple of times had to ask for another fork/spoon because mine was dirt "
one of my favorite place in arnhem where i can just chilling out and enjoying myself and my vacation!! just visit it .. thank you
i went here with a friend for lunch. the location is so perfect. really close to all the shops as also to the train station. it was crowded on a fridaymidday. the service was still pretty good. they even offered me to be able to charge my phone at my table with their powerbank. so nice! there was plenty of choice for healthy and non-healthy options for food. it all looked very delicious. and so was the coffee.
"in essence a kind of hip coffee bar in the centre of arnhem. home made pies are wonderful, pricing is quite ok. nice atmosphere. enjoyed it."
there are all kinds of seating arrangements. there‚Äôs also a high chair for children and low tables with matching chairs. all kinds of people visit this pla 
"im avid coffee and tea drinker, so naturally i was drawn into this shop, it quickly became my favorite.  and for that the reasons are many, free wifi (always a plus), happy nice employees, and finally amazing coffe and tea (i recommend the chai latte)"
"met with a friend for tea. great place. they also have sandwiches, cakes & muffins, paninis, quiches. and free wifi, so its also a nice place to go and work or study."
this is the best coffee spot in arnh 
"the service was excellent, they were very friendly. the food was fresh and delicious! a great place to have a quick bite to eat or to just hang out with friends."
very tasty vegan food! very creative and unique dishes. as i couldnt decide what to eat i chose the taste it! special with small portions of different dishes. highly recommendable! very satiably :)
only came here for smoothies. they are freshly made using fresh ingredients. reasonably priced and come in glass bottles. highly recommend! 
"vegan, raw, organic, healthy home-style meals. great for the health conscious who want oil-free, healthy, rustic food. also a fine selection of cakes, smoothies, teas and coffees."
"if you want to eat healthy in arnhem, you should go here!! its vegan :). you can only go here for food during daytime but the taste is unforgettabl "
this is my first real vegan experience as eating is considered. and to be honest i couldnt be happier . the staff is sssooooo helpful and the food is delicious. the place is inviting and the prices are fairly reasonab 
we meet friends for coffee in rawsome and it was yumm 
a great find and busy for a sunday evening. huge portions (and not just rice - very healthy portions of chicken as well). nicest peshwari man for a long time! defo visit again.
"we ordered chefs menu, 3 courses. which was delicious. good, tasteful, spiced meat with rice and naan bread. friendly staff. compliments to the cooks. you need to stretch some time when dining overhere because staff is quite busy. but nevertheless a good experience."
"visited for dinner, portions were very generous, so be aware if you are ordering a starter! food very tasty and nicely presented, staff attentive without being intrusive, would definitely recommend this indian restaurant"
"...& got masterchef! its a strange eat all you can restaurant & we wondered if it might fail but the food was excellent, a real little gem."
"we are not specialist in indian food so, we asked for a recomendation and it was really good. service was phenomenal as well"
normally week days they use to have buffet which is around 18 eur pp (not sure 16 eur) was really good food we enjoyed lot
"on sunday night, at 20 hrs, it was a very busy place! but it didnt take long to be able starting dinner. excellent, cos we dont like to wait endlessly. staff is very friendly."
"took out an indian dish in stead of eating in-house. it was tasty, but the balance between meat and vegetables/sauce was way off. more sauce then meat or veggies. a bit too expensive as well. perhaps eating indoors is better."
"i really didnt want to give 5 stars, because then the place would be even busier. the food is very good, the flavors are delicious and the staff is very friendly. i liked the way the place is decorated. the food is not expensive, but good quality. only downside is the number of patrons which makes waiting times a bit longer sometimes. "
"food is delicious, great flavors!! super friendly staff, but the wait was a bit long. i went twice in the last week and both times i was there for over 3 hours for a 3 course meal. didnt care for the desserts much, main courses and starters were great. they also do take out a lot, which might explain our longer wait. so that might be a better option unless you have all the time in the world :) and if the weather allows, theres a cute outside sitting area in the back! enjoy!"
"from the outside the restaurant looked an interesting mix of indian objet dart and lanterns. the menu however looked liked a very ordinary list of anglicised curries. the meal though was an exciting mixture of dishes with flavours that were really fresh and danced across your tongue. the manageress and staff could not do enough for us and our young daughter. excellent meal, ambiance and service. thank you."
"the food was delicious. from prawn tikka masala to the spicier lamb madras it was cooked freshly, beautifully seasoned - subtle, complex and sufficient for our party of 4 (big and discerning eaters). we will definitely come again and definitely recommend this restaurant."

very nice place for a brunch or just a cup of coffee . the french toast was perfect as well as the avocado toast
"this place is in a quieter street in the centre, which is perfect if you dislike crowded places. the lemonades we ordered were really special and tasty. the lobster roll was delicious, it tasted really fresh. i highly recommend this place."
"we‚Äôve been in the city for a spontaneous brunch and had the pleasure to find this beautiful, sweet cafe next to the city center. the place is lovely designed with a charming vintage look and the food/drinks perfectly round up the romantic atmosphere. even with slightly higher prices, the overall package/value you get is absolutely recommendable. the service girls are even sweeter than their choice of cakes ;) looking forward to visit this place again!"
"we had a great salad and tuna melt. friendly staff. just behind the main square, so it does not have the feel of too touristy."
"really good place to have breakfast. the place looks light and spacious, good soft music in the background, excellent staff/very friendly, and the food is delicious."
good selection for breakfast and coffee for weekend brunch! may be a little wait time but well worth it. got the avocado toast with drip coffee and found it good bang for my buck.
"service was friendly and fast, coffee was superb and the avo and bacon toast was delicious and the best breakfast i have found in the netherlands (where it seems good breakfasts are hard to find!). highly recommend."

"this was my first afghan restaurant in my life. i had a plate for pilaf and 3 dishes, saag, curry chicken and meat bowl. food was nice and decent.i don‚Äôt know if it was afghan original because i had similar dish in uzbekistan or some other islamic countries. i had afghan tea after dinner it was nice with spices. wait for a while, it takes time that taste comes out and a bit too ho "
"this restaurant has the most delicious food in nijmegen! its reasonably priced, authentic, traditional food. i recommend the mantoe for entree and any of the rice dishes (with 3 accompanying sides). a must try is the traditional coriander chutney; served at the beginning of the meal with 2 other dips. the staff are very friendly and families are welcome. our young kids were given pencils and paper and love to eat at this restaurant also. afghani food is the perfect mix between northern asian/indian and middle eastern cuisine. the food and experience at hafiza and flavours will not disappoint i am sure."
"excellent food and service. we ordered online. the food arrived exactly on time. it was also a safe delivery. we ordered chabi kebab, qabeli palaw and narenj palaw with a range of vegan, vegetarian and meat side dishes. this was the first time we tried afghan food, and it was amazing. perfectly seasoned and cooked. the palaws were great on their own. i can imagine them as light summer dishes. ill eat there as often as i can. i wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant!"
"this place serves tasty afghan cuisine for a reasonable price. i took the sweet rice with orange peel, almonds and pistachio combined with 3 sides: pumpkin, kofta and veal. food was likely prepared in advance but that didnt matter as it was very tasty and full of flavor. the exotic home made ice cream was a great way to end this dinner. service provided by the staff was friendly and helpful. recommend!"
"this was the first time i tried afghan food and i really enjoyed it. we selected a rice dish with three accompanying dishes, mostly vegetables and some meat. each flavourful dish tasted great and was distinct from the other ones. make sure to select the pumpkin and the zucchini side dishes. their selection of wines is somewhat limi "
the food is heavenly delicious. the best food i ate in a very long time. the staff is very friendly. they have made this afghan corner with nice paintings and afghan mattresses which gives you a cozy ambiance. the music was also peaceful and at a perfect volume. five stars from me.
"first go at afghani food and it was delicious. staff/owners were super friendly and helpful. contrary to other reviews i saw, there is an english menu you just need to ask for it. highly recommend a meal here."
"the food is amazing, we loved everything. the place is elegant and service excellent. strongly suggested!"
"we were spending the weekend in nijmegen, without defined plans. after a visit to the orientalis museum we got in the mood to eat eat food. we found an indication to hafiza and landed there to try out. it was amazing. delicious food in quiet environment for eating. really became my top indication in nijmegen"
"we were exploring a quiet and good place to dine. we looked for an unusual cuisine as we had been traveling for many days eating british, dutch and indian food. we went to hafiza as you often do n "
"the service, the place and the food is just amazing! !a modern restaurant with an oriental touch we loved every minute there."
"hafiza is situated opposite the central station in nijmegen, the oldest city in the netherlands. the menu is completely afghan, i see all the afghan specialties i was eating in shar-e-naw in kabul over the last couple of years. the mantou is of excellent quality and the diverse rice dishes are of excellent afghan quality. of course, the ferni, a special afghan desert, cannot be missed. the afghan music brings you in the real afghan atmosphere. the only difference with the real afghanistan is that there is no special room for women and families. so all sexes have to sit together. i do not see that as a problem in nijmegen."
i went out for dinner with a colleague scouting for a good restaurant to take some work guests . its often hard to find g 
we had a diner withour family of 4 in this cozy restaurant. the staff was very friendly and the food tasted excellent. we love the spices of the afghan cuisine! also lots of vegetarian choices.
this is the place where in earlier days bagles and beans was located. really nice make-over and see-through kitchen! it was our first time being here and i must admit that it was a very nice experience. very friendly personnel and the food we had for lunch was excellent. will surely come back to this place.
"surprisingly good bar and restaurant from the same owner as hotel the prince. nice decoration, open kitchen and quality food. we enjoyed the fresh lokal white asparagus with salmon very much. will be back!"
"quiet around 5.30, later it got busier. service is quick but friendly. decent food for reasonable price. i asked for bleu tournedos and usually get mine overcooked. not here. bleu is ble "
"we had dinner here on a friday evening, even though it was quite busy we experienced a friendly service. both the tournedos and the entrec√¥te were excellent."
"we had a light lunch at this place while visiting nijmegen. quality of food and drinks is good, service ok."
"i had a good breakfast, and though small the coffee has a very relaxed atmosphere. prices were very reasonably."
"this place is really cozy and i love sitting here. people come here to have a coffee or a quick lunch snack some of them play boardgames, chat or simply read a paper. they do have good coffee and for the lactose intolerant or vegan it can be ordered with soya milk. the food is basic, but well made and fresh. they offer a variety of sandwiches, salads and soups, typical for lunch in the netherlands. you can sit outside if you want to. they do have a bookexchange, primarily dutch and english books, where you can just swap your finished book for another. staff is really friendl "
"good food after food stroll in kronenburgerpark. great combo food and stroll, easy reachable @ centre. fresh made good food. nice salade sandwiches soup cakes and coffee or tea‚Äôs. all good"
"dropped in for a coffee and saw the types of yyoghurt fantasies being offered so we tried some. the gentleman preparing went out of his way to explain the various components of the dishes and went about building them. they were excellent, well presented in a very rustic environment (kind of cafeesque) with many open computers and young dialogu "
decided to take a break from our usual cafe and try somewhere new. we only had drinks but they were very tasty and fresh. the yogurt dishes looked delicious too.
stumbled upon this place and decided to try their yoghurts. the place is not that big but cozy. lovely fresh homemade yoghurt with great additions to choose from. great place for breakfast!
"we stopped by this place to take shelter from the rain, and to see if they served soy cappuccinos. they sure do cater to people with different dietary requirements, such as lactose intolerance. when i read the ‚Äúyoghurt‚Äù sign i first thought they meant frozen yogurt. but they actually mean the yogurt you eat for breakfast (or dessert in the nl). they have many kinds - including almond and coconut yogurt for the anti-lactose people. this goes hand in hand with just about any topping you can imagine, from brownie chunks to blueberries or fresh dates. the sandwiches looked amazing, too, although i didn‚Äôt get to try them. i‚Äôll definitely be back for more. stop by this place when you‚Äôre in nijmegen. it‚Äôs well worth it!"
"a very good feel and a cosy, contemporary interior. the fresh orange juice and smoothie tasted really good, as did the croissants. service is friendly and swift, and it also caters for children."
"the venue has a cool style and great food and drinks. a bit costly in some parts, but worth it. perfect place to spend an hour or two in calm athmosphere."
"my friends and i went there for a brunch and we were positively surprised: we got a nice selection of yoghurt with all kinds of toppings. the homemade yoghurt was fresh, the juices were delicious and the atmosphere was also nice."
"just came across this place whilst wandering around the centre of nijmegen. doesnt appear to leap out at you, but filled our need for coffee and cake. good coffee, slixe of carrot cake did us just fine. eur13. small menu and perhaps a little quirky, but ok."
this cute little cafe offers something for everyone with a cosy ambience and friendly staff. we chose coffees and almond croissants which took a little time to arrive as they had been warmed in an oven and served with cream. yummy!!! the lunch menu looked good and the prices were very good. a real find.
great for a quick lunch break! we stopped by on our bike trip heading for the north sea and had a quick lunch break. the sandwiches and tostis are definetly worth am try! these also dell good coffee and homemade lemonade.
"i liked this place so much. i ordered one sandwich with chicken, avocado, parmesano and sause and it was amazing!! and also the soup van de dag is heerlijk!!"
heared good recommendations so decided to check it out. the pokebowl was very tasty. we also had an icecoffee and the awesome thing was that we were asked if we wanted is sweetened. such a kind question. very friendly and genuine waitress. will come back to try the rest of the menu 
"we had dinner on a september evening on the terrace still nice in the sun.  food and service were both very good value for the money.  portions were nice, vegetables fresh.  just a very enjoyable evening."
"lovely people, great breakfast and clean rooms. what do you need more? ill be staying again. thank you. :)"
"the best vega kroketten a man can find. friendly service, and beautiful location right on the grote markt. highly recommended!"
"this hotel with restaurant is back on track! the new owners know what style is and how to make the customers feel comfortable. we were with a big group, so we had a limited menu as their concept is you can pick three dishes to make your own meal. that didn‚Äôt bother us at all. the dishes were served a bit cold, that is a thing that could be improved. they really did a great job on renovating."
"this restaurant is something special, the food you get in all kind of different plates is wonderfully and really prepared fresh and really tasty specially because it is mostly healthy food . even if you are on a dieet you can find something what fit‚Äôs in it for sure. you can sit in the bar and enjoy watching how they cook and prepare your food full of passi "
"i can not relate with the negative reviews. i went there tonight for the first time and it was delicious. to be honest, the portions seems small until you start with it. we orded an extra mezze besides the chefs menu because our eyes were bigger than our tummys. everything had a different taste and was good. they offered to give us a doggybag, so tomorrow the lunch is again mezze. i would recommend it to everyone who wants something different than the usual. price is also fair if you see how much work theres put in. kind waitress, nice chefs!"
the souk only just opened its doors. we were there the 3rd week of its i existence. we had dinner at the bar with view at the kitchen. was very nice to see how relaxed the food was prepared. the mezze (all small dishes) were excellent and had great tastes from the mediterranean kitche 
"i read some reviews - but not on here. so, we were hesitant when we went in. the other reviews must be of a different restaurant than tonight. the ladies taking orders and serving were very good and the food excellent. i eat a lot of curry and this is very good ‚Äúindian‚Äù food. would we go again? definitely."
"they serve a very nice mango lassi and the food is absolutely tasty as well. the people are really friendly too, the only minor downside is that the restaurant can feel a bit packed."
just happened to find this restaurant on trip advisor this evening and decided to eat here. the service was friendly and professional. there was plenty to choose from on the menu. we thoroughly enjoyed the food here and we would definitely come here again and recommend this restaurant to everyone who loves indian food. delicious!!!
we were on a visit in holland and had an early evening meal in the india gate retsurant. the food was delicious and we very much enjoyed the friendly welcoming atmosphere there as well as the good style interior decor. a pity that we didnt have more time to spend in this place...we had to leave early for we had to return to germany the same evening. but we will definitely come back!!!
"last night, we had a lovely vegetarian dinner at india gates restaurant in nijmegen. i enjoyed the hot tea that accompanied the vegetables with rice too. cosy atmosphere. recommended!"
real authentic indian food at its best.  lovely ambiance and the service very attentive.  will definitely frequent this restaurant.
"i‚Äôve been to many indian restaurants around the world and this one was one of the bests! mango lassi and indian tee are super recommended. i took prawns in spicy tomato sauce and liked it a lot. the waitress was very kind and funny, dressed in a beautiful traditional salwar. i would not mind coming back again. i am from hungary by the way ;)"
i have been a customer for quite a few years and it is hands down the best and most authentic indian restaurant in nijmegen and the bigger region. since ive been a customer for some time it really stands out that the quality of the food has been consistent throughout the entire time!! ive seen otherwise in a lot of other restaurants unfortunately .
"tonight, we had a lovely, and not too spicy, dinner at this relatively tiny restaurant in nijmegen - in preparation of our upcoming trip to india. the green wood and other interior decoration breathed an authentic atmosphere. the staff was welcoming and helpful."
"on a short stopover in nijmegen decided to go for dinner. the restaurant is located right in the center, central station is 7-8 min walk aw "
something different in nijmegen! a really good little restaurant. both lamb and chicken curries were good and the vegetarian side dish of baked chilli cauliflower was terrific. reasonably priced.
this hotel perhaps is the best indian punjabi food hotel in the netherlands. it has almost all the options available for indian food.
"being an avid fan of authentic, spicy indian food, i always look forward to my trips to europe where the indian food is more authentic than that in the us. while on a recent trip to the netherlands where i was staying in the city of nijmegen, i came across india gate. i usually judge an indian restaurant by the spiciness of their vindaloo. i was pleasantly surprised when the vindaloo i ordered at india gate was on par with that of indian restaurants in the uk (which to me is the gold standard in europe). the staff were friendly and the quality of food was excellent!"
i have been to this restaurant couple of times in last 2 months while i was there for business. restaurant is small but the food quality and services are too good. owner personally ensures that you get the best food and services promptly. i will recommend to anyone who visits nijmegen to try this restaurant
"very cozy and romantic restaurant. real indian owner and food. the spicy dishes are very spicy, i loved it."
the dutch arent renowned for good food so i was doubly sceptical about indian food in holland but the food here was deliciou 
i was here with my family for my birthday. the food was quite good but not extraordinary. there is not a lot of space in the establishment which makes it feel crowded easily as the tables are very close to each othe 
"have been more than once to india gate restaurant. very small place located in a shopping street which could easily be overlooked. once inside notice different atmosphere, thanks to typical lightgreen, indian music and welcome by hosts. the restaurant is a narrow but deep space crammed with tables. and it seems to be always full. so advise to make a reservation if you can. there is hardly a waiting area if you would decide to try and wait for a table to come free. besides most people go here for a long dinner-evening. so many authentic indian dishes to choose from and ranging from mild to strong spiced. you can always ask for suggestions and ask to temper with spices on request. to me the best indian food restaurant in town."
stuffed ourselves and somehow the bill was under 50eur! biryani and dopiaza were excellent. ill go back.
great place to sit and enjoy the jewels of india. no hurries and no worries. kitchen and serving staff can offer advice on what to enjoy and how hot the dishes are.
"over the course of a year i get to stay approx. 3-4 times in the nijmegen area. i discovered india gate some years back and they also were the reason why i started my indian restaurant tour, when on business travel in europe thing initial "
india gate is the indian restaurant in nijmegen. each item is freshly prepared and delicious. there are many regional choices: tandoori with naan or roumali roti...lassis for a refreshing drink...and lots more. namaste!
india gate offers a great and tasty experience for a decent pri 
"india gate is a wonderful restaurant, the hostess really connects with you, makes sure you have all you need and the cook prepares exactly what you ask in the most tastefull mann "
"on a recent business trip to nijmegen, i went for indian food with 6 colleagues, some of who had been previously. the waitress remembered a few of my colleagues and mixed a special dish for them..she customised the dishes to suit everyones palat..starters to share very good, but the main course was fabulous..nan breads also deserve special mention.. will definitely return when in nijmegen again"
we were at this place a few months ago but i did not have the time to write something on tripadviso 
"i went to this restaurant several time and every time was a unique experience. the owners are beautiful persons and they serve everything with elegance. the dishes are adjosted a little bit to the dutch taste but they are very good, all of them. definitely one of the best places to have dinner in nijmegen."
"india gate is the only decent curry in nijmegen.  its a bit pricey if youre used to british curry place, but as its the only game in town..well..there you go.  the naan bread cant be missed, and the service is spot on."
my family loves indian food. in 30years we never had better food than at indian gate. the service is great as the atmosphere. so try there excellent food.
the oldest and by far the best indianfoodplace in town.for people who love spiced or not spiced food. dishes are serverd with basmati or nan.
"i used to work close to nijmegen a long time ago and india gate was my favourite restaurant at the time. just recently i had the chance to return and to my great surprise nothing had changed! still the same excellent menu (prices had gone up a little) and service but to my astonishment the lady proprietor actually remembered my name! had a memorable evening, great food, service and fun. just a shame that its far from where i live. highly recommended...."
"very friendly hostess, remembers your name and/or knows that you come more often. my wife has an allergy for peanuts and the hostess remembers always that my wife has an allegy of some kind, it is for the kitchen no problem to prepare food if there is somebody in youre group with any kind of aller "
"excellent quality food, a very comprehensive choice of dishes to suit all tastes be they hot and spicy or something to suit the milder palate. excellent and friendly staff"
"i remember this excellent restaurant from years ago, and remember it was always supe "
"our hotel recommended india gate. the food was good, but service is slow. i would agree with other reviews that there is a difference in how they appear to treat tourists. we had one of the combo dinners and it was a lot of food for two people. it had just the right amount of heat. the place was very busy with take-out order. given how small it is i guess locals would rather get food to go."
"the best indian restaurant in the netherlands, and better than all indian restaurants i visited in the uk and singapor "
"we had a delicious meal in this small restaurant. we went without a reservation, around 20.00 hrs on a friday night and luckily there was a table available. i think only because the university holiday started i think, better reserve when you want to  "
we booked at table when passing on the afternoon - we were glad we did as it was busy when we went at 20:00 for dinner. very authentic indian food. staff were happy to adjust recipes based on taste & preference. lamb melted in our mouths in the 2 dishes we ordered as did the chicken in another dish. 
"this is a very nice small restaurant with friendly indian staff. even though i usually only go there once every few months, they know my face and the food is very nice. once you have made a choice from the menu, they immediately offer poppadums and 3 sauces. i have never had to wait very long for my dinner which is just the way i like it."
nice place quite close to the center of nijmegen. the staff is very friendly and food is simply delicious! the interior is nothing special tho
"we have been going to india gate for close to 20 years now, and still love it! excellent food ranging from mild to hot (vindaloo); naturally, great vegetarian options, too. very friendly and knowledgable indian staff that speaks english and dutch fluently and will remember you. nicely decorated, fairly small and intimate, indian music in the background. just go for a main course - youll feel stuffed, trust me! drink mango juice or lassi, which combines much better with indian food than wine or beer (just my personal opinion). guests: many indian business people and regulars. a friend of ours, who has visited india about 50 times by now, told us this is the best indian restaurant in the netherlands!! i.e.: great value, very affordable! enjoy!!"
"if you like indian food, this is a good place to go. the food is excellent, the service great and the hostess very nice."
the balti tika masala and rogan josh were phenomenal.  i highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.
"i visit the city a lot on business so looked around and this restaurant was recommended the food was very good and the waiter was very helpful with the menu, a little expensive but it was worth it i will definitely return aga "
"found myself in nijmengen for the night and after consulting tripadvisor found the indian gate. very nice indian food, plenty to eat and very good quality. would recommend and puts some uk indian restaurants in the shade. quite expensive by uk standards but was a nice treat."
