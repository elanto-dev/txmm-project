"i fail to understand why this describes itself as an indian restaurant as the meal we had did not have any flavour , seasoning or heat normally associated with this type of food. perhaps the locals of leerdam do not like spicy food- if they did they would not be eating here. neither will we on a future visit to the area. easily the most tasteless indian food weve ever been served."
"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
just a chinese restaurant that you -vint down anywhere in the country. fine it is that you know exactly what is delivered food quality
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
subzero is in a small shopping center near the center of amstelveen and yes there is a line here as well.  the parking is ample and the ice cream was good i tried the white chocolate and the lemoncello.
food quality was good but there’s a lot of hookah and place is stuffed with hookah smoke. i also have heard through grapevine that the owner is abusive and violent person and exploits and abuse the workers that are in vulnerable situations. it’s not worth it avoid this place
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.
we went to this place for lunch and had okay-ish pancakes. location is perfect for a break while shopping in the mall.
had lunch here earlier this week with my best frie 
"the food and drinks are ok but by now there have been multiple instances where i, and/or the people i was accompanied by, were treated incredibly poorly. the staff has been very denigrating towards customers, giving snarky responses to normal questions or complaints, i.e. menu did not list all the ingredients used for dishes. one of the sandwiches contained mayonnaise, though this was not indicated. my acquaintance, who is allergic to eggs, ordered this and got an incredibly rude response when she complained about this to the staff. the response was overly defensive and shifted all the blame to my friend, who had carefully read the ingredients list beforehand. the tone with which this was said, too, was unacceptable. it almost seems as if the staff purposely tries to make their customers feel like they are idiots. overall, terrible experience(s)."
the selection of small plates is extensive and we always get several all the shrimp  choices are good.
"we will write our comment in english, so everyone (even foreigners and tourists) will understand. it was a terrible choice to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and another 20 year life event/celebration in this restaurant. if we had known in advance how poor the service and food was... the meat was fine (the only fine thing actually), however there were almost no vegetables on the plate, only a piece of lettuce... furthermore, the reception/service was incredibly impersonal, cold, not child-friendly at all and not polite. first of all, there is no child menu. this is the first time we visit a restaurant without children menu... moreover, the restaurant was almost empty, but all we got offered at arrival was a table by the door (?) we are a family with two little children, its winter, it is really cold outside, a table by the door for a family in an almost empty restaurant makes no sense, there were lots of empty tables far from the door! of course, we refused, and then they told us we could seat at the back. when ordered the dessert, we got first one dessert and then the other one, but much later! also, we ordered two desserts for 4 persons. normally the service would bring 4 spoons, in case you would like to share. but, this restaurant didnt have any attention to detail. it is the first time this happens to us too. the sticky rice dessert was not sticky at all, was dangerously hot and too sweet. it wasnt possible to enjoy it, it was just extemely hot and we had to blow and blow until it got less hot, like 15 minutes later. wifi was just inexistant... and when leaving the place, we werent even ready putting our jacket on when the service came to clean up the table, in an almost empty restaurant... how rude. this has actually never happened to us before either. we go out for dinner regularly. really, please dont waste your money and time with people who dont have any sensibilty for clients, or for children, or a client service mentality. we are very angry because this kind of service can really ruin ones special celebrations/nights! such a pity. of course, we will never ever go back and will make sure everybody knows how poor, rude and cold caphé saigons service is."
"i have been a regular visit to this restaurant, usually i visit the one in gelderlandplein but since new branch open in amstelveen, i start to go here. however i believe this new branch still need to improve with customer service. i felt the one in gelderlandplein is better in sense of customer service. it is pity because i love the food but i expect same quality of service whichever branch i visit "
"i was surprised how poor quality vietnamese food was served at this place, as i’m familiar with vietnamese cuisine. the sauces that came with the dishes (summer roll)was simply from a supermarket bottle, no additional touch. the sauce with the poor quality duck was simple soya sauce from the bottle with on the bottom tasteless paksoi steamed only, without any oil/salt, served cold! rice was served cold! all with all, it was deeply disappointing. i would definitely not recommend this pla "

place is packed with people and youd have to get your kids to eat their pancakes while standing. pancakes themselves are nice but not thrilling ( quite fattening ).
"the pancakes are great, well cooked, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! the bacon cheese is very good and so is the spicy..they offer gluten-free pancake (if you order in the morni "
a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."
we went to this indian restaurant after reading a good review from restaurant criti 
"nothing great to mention, staff isnt professional. not kip options to select from. its rather bland in nature with a crumpled sitting."
"it wasnt great at all, lacked salt. staff however was courteous. no kip item so to mention.  ..  .  .  ."
"this is one of the few real pizzerias in amstelveen. we visited it quite a few times and the atmosphere is relaxed and child friendly. the pizzas are of a good quality and thave he right size. the only thing i don’t understand is the change in the wine policy. formerly one could order wine in in a caraf of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 cl, but now you can order only bottles of wine. this not only is much more expensive but also offers less flexibility. so please change it!"
"once upon a time this was a nice, cheap and cheerful neighbourhood italian bistro but that time sadly appears to be gone. tasteless, awful, inedible food that for a large part appears to have been bought-in from some second-rate cash and carry outlet before being inexpertly warmed up. the waiter didnt seem to be at all surprised all three of the diners plates went back largely untouched, so i dont think think the current car crash is a sudden phenomenon."
"feels genuinely italian - children very welcome, you can watch the pizza dough being spun, pasta and risotto dishes very tasty."
"was craving for a traditional udon curry. but it was an absolutely disappointment. you get a super tiny bowl of udon that you can finish in two slurp. for the price of 17 euro is was embarrassing shocking, no meat, no vegetables, just the curry sauce and few springles of spring ion. could ordered some tempura.. but as a side dish 18 euro extra for few tempura in comparison outside in amsterdam restaurants you get for half the price....was not worth it. i was out of the place in 10min. for all the japanese restaurant i have been, this is not worth the money. and not coming back to try out other tiny meals. "
"went there for dinner and was disappointed. gyu don had three pieces of overcooked tasteless beef. okonomiyaki looked nice, but was burned and covered up with mayonaise. takoyaki, fried noodles and buta kimchi itame were alright. portions were small and quality was lacking for that price. orange juice is canned and mineral water is the cheapest bottle of water you can get in the supermarket. calpis was good. "
"the noodles is okay. a bit expensive. the restaurant ambiance is cozy and suitable for young people,"
"my noodle bowl came nicely presented with broken pieces of grilled nori, the noodles and broth were quite nice, al dente and fragrant, however the shredded meat was tough and chewy, bummer. at 12 eur reasonably priced. free green tea during lunch time, nice touch."
"we have visited this restaurant a few times; last time was two years ago, far too long ago, and i would rate the food 4 to 5 stars back th "
"slow service, no advicing. food is ok in taste but not very special. interieur like kitchentables, cheap and low quality."
"i havent been here for 4 years. and after i visit it few days ago. i will never come back again. before there was service, the food is delicious and it was good!! but i got the most bad experience i have in the korean cuisine. so disappointed! its more like we were not korean so they were threaten us like outsiders. so bad service. the food was not like before so delicious like poor seasoning. too bad. "
"generally korean food is rather expensive in the netherlands compared to lets say london, where quality is also superior. the jukgaejang was rather bland and appeared to have been made with msg. chicken (dakangjung) was alright but unfortunately not boneless filet. chaeukbokkum (pork) was decent but a lot more spicy than ive had before. the service could also be a lot better. we were the first to sit down but took quite some time to have our food. tables arriving after us were getting their dishes ahead of us. it seems that a large group of korean people from a nearby church were getting the quick and attentive service at the expense of other customers."
i wont go back nor recommend this place. the food was not up to the par. the staff where friendly enough but not brilliant at there job. there knowledge of wine was very poor.
"damso is a korean restaurant frequented by koreans, so that might be a sign of authenticity of the cuisine. the food, however, was below par in our ca "
"ice creams are quite good, close to italy! because of long cues in the evening, servers are not smiling and welcoming you. nobody cares the cleaning of tables.."
"decided to celebrate start of the school holiday by eating out, we fancied mexican so reserved cantina del corazon using ah vouchers (two 3-course meals for €37,50). once there, our kids decided to go for separate courses - as advised by the manager, cas. then he said we couldnt change it anymore as we had reserved online and he would have to pay commission on the special deal. when it was time to pay, we offered to compensate him for the commission but he refused, insisted on charging us €157 and became very unpleasant when we did not agree. eventually a lady (i think the owner) told him to back off and settled the bill for us. we left disappointed and upset. even though the food had been ok and the restaurants location is great, i definitely cant recommend cantina del corazon."
"lovely location on the banks of the amstel. surely a nice place for a drink, but dont come here for the food or the servic "
"it is a mystery to me how someone who acts like he despised people can open a restaurant, and on top of all, call it canteen of the heart "
"this restaurant has a great location on the amstel river. where better to share tapas and wine on a hot summers day? maybe somewhere else if you are expecting friendly service! food and wine are both fine, the staff (owners?) are 2 of the most miserable hospitality staff i have ever come across. not made to feel welcome at all, this has happened before, though this was definately the last time for us. if your customers are just an inconvenience then its time for a career change!"
"in may we went here for dinner with a group of friends, as we could benefit from an offer (main course for eur 10,-- "
"the bartender or owner was rude and knows nothing about customer service, was rude and not friendly and the food is not even that good."
pretty good food. i wish service was a little more curteous and polite. the place is quirky and well decorated and on a sunny day im sure the terrace by the water would be a lovely place to sit out and have a corona. will certainly come back again ...for the food and location more than anything else.
we will not be returning here....food was fine but the customer contact personnel leave a lot to be desired....or may be they just dislike english ex-pats!!!! host and hostess very churlish..not friendly..in fact almost rude...served us grudgingly....and on paying the bill we discovered that apparently they have no toilets here only for themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont go here if you are desperate for the loo......good news is that a little further along the river is another very friendly looking place...next time we head there and leave this to another unsuspecting customer.
"i would leave zero stars if i could. very poor quality food. the food was stale meat, horrible taste, overcooked and to make it even worse it is not even close to authentic. they should not call themselves as an indonesian restaura "
"despite the exceptionally friendly and courteous service, it was a miserable experience. the 2 main reasons were: a) an extremely slow service where at least 20 minutes elapsed between ordering a drink and serving a drink; b) the quality of the food was so weak that even the wait staff went back to the kitchen to ask if the dish was good. if hells kitchen ever comes to amstelveen, lemon grass is a perfect location for a total turnaround"
"we had quite a good indonesian dinner here -- and i have also been to indonesia. the place was busy, and prices not expensi "
"we went here to have something different.......the staff are very pleasant but lacking in real service...we ordered a bottle of rose.....it took the 10 mins of searching that they didnt have any...we opted for a pinot grigio..they found that but it wasnt cold so we opted for beer.....we ordered the chicken satay skewers to share,a beef rendang and a nasi goreng and some steamed rice.....the skewers were really nice .....my wife got her beef which was enough to feed 2 people with enough steamed rice to feed a family....my nasi goreng came with 2 chicken satay skewers.....if i had known that i would have originally ordered prawn skewers......the food was very nice but way too much.....the service was not up to standard"
"the traditional rice tables are are clearly the highlight of the menu , 15 dishes at approximately euro 25 per head ( min 2 pax) . alacarte options are extensive , with a decent vegetarian selection .   small restaurant  with a warm and friendly  ambience"
"the pizza was fresh cooked, large and very tasty – as well as being kosher which was important to my companion. the price had surprisingly increase by €1 since they displayed their prices on the wall – from €9.99 to €10.99 but it still seemed fair. the ambience was very café like – crowded tables, help-yourself cutlery and drinks cans. quite fun overall. "

this restaurant is located in a residential area along with some other (less popular) eateries. the interior is neat without fril 
i made an online booking at 18:30 for 20:30 the same day. i got an email saying my booking was pending and i would get an email soon. i got an email at 21:05 saying my booking (now in the past) was confirmed ! by this time i was seated in the nearby dwali palace where i had a fabulous meal. obviously the indian kitchen thinks it has no competition and that people will hang around until they choose to anoint potential customers with a confirmation - i wont be trying to get in again
"the location is good, you can park here free after 7 p "
a nice little find and good food. the service was excellent. the tikka lamb chops were nice albeit a bit too salty. the butter chicken was very good too.
"i went for dinner yesterday together with my family after a delightful outing the last time around. however our experience this time was not good. to start with, the service was very poor. it took around 1 hr after placing the order that food arrived. chicken tandoori was cold. the dish chicken malaiwala which was supposed to be with drumsticks as according to the menu card was made with chicken filet and when told that this is not what was written on the menu card, the waiter/ waitress came with the explanation that it was not very well translated in the english menu and that “chicken filet” in dutch means “kippen pootjes“ as was written on the dutch menu card. to top it they wouldnt serve a glass of tap water for my 4 yr old daughter and forced us to have a bottle of mineral water costing 5 euros. since i didn’t want to spoil my evening i went along and accepted it but i wouldn’t recommend this “arrogant” restaurant anyone anymor "
"i am a big fan of the food in this restaurant and the staff are always very friendly. however, the service is very sl "
very bad service... waiters are veryy rude.. we asked for a warm poppadum.. reply was it is served cold sorry we can’t warm it and can’t bring new one...that was too rude.. 😡don’t recommend to anyone.. food quality is also very bad.. doesn’t taste good..
"have been there couple of times, indian food is more authentic than other indian restaurants in neighborhood especially the starters and vegetarian curries."
"i was there tonight. the ambience is pretty good, but the food is utterly disappointing. the portion sizes are shocking. you literally get two tiny pieces of bland half boiled potato and two even tinier florets of cauliflower when you order a tandoori aloo gobi for which they charge 5 euro. apart from the tiny portion sizes, the fact is that they dont do justice to the quality and taste of good they serve. let them charge me 10 euro, but please give me something that is decent and fills atleast 3-4 mouthfuls. very unscrupulous way to take unsuspecting european customers on a ride, making them believe this is actually good indian food, by providing a smile and good ambience. extremely disappointing. never going back again, and ill make sure i pass on the word"
when askd for different table the waitress had so much attitude to say a staright no....in the end turned out that thr were lots of tables empty and no one ever came on the empty tables we asked for... other waitress did not know about the menu and was rude.... qty of wine served was really poor.... im sry good food but you need a lot of improvemnt...
"accept it has good food to offer, but staff really need to improve on conduct. if you ask for tap water you get a lecture on how bad amsterdam water is.. ask for more than 4 variety of food and they can fight to convince that its not a good idea.. in short the place is not welcoming!!"
"we love indian food and living in the middle of nowhere (literally) and our closest best options being in amsterdam central we were very excited when we heard that a good indian restaurant was opening in amstelveen. my husband and i have eaten at the indian kitchen about four times now and we have had take-out once, which i think leaves me qualified to have a pretty good opinion as to how the place work "
decent food options but with good ambience. the place is expensive for its location. it is $$ for a single person.
"visited this place on the back of on line reviews rather than personal recommendation. this was a saturday night at 7.45 but actually the restaurant was 1/3 full maximum. the waiters/waitresses did not seem to know who should look after which tables, even though we were pleasantly dealt with by the individual waiter/waitresses and it took an hour from walking in to receive our starters. there was a lot of attention to the level of spiciness we wished for and we undercalled it a bit by asking for medium, the mains arrived but disappointingly they were only warm to hot , two dishes were meant to be sizzling and really were not, and the daal was nearer lukewarm. a shame as actually the favours for all dishes were good , and we easily could eat everything except the daal.i strongly suspect the kitchen was struggling with takeaways and in house service but overall this experience did not live up to the expectations that the reviews suggested. i would conclude an average curry house and fair value for money , but nothing i could not find in most uk towns ( but i dont live there anymore "
"it has been a good take away food joint for many years but turned into a restaurant and food though good, is a bit expensive for the quality and location.  i used to like their food from their take-away joint days."
"there are not many indian restaurants in amstelveen to choose from so the indian kitchen is almost always our dinner restaurant of choice (it is open only during the evenings). the menu, like almost all restaurants in the netherlands typically has various indian bread and also biryani with veggetables, chicken or lamb. the main dishes have various cottage cheese (paneer) based dishes in addition to potato - peas, peas - spinach and cauliflower based dishes. the starters are also fine. the ambience and service is nothing special as the restaurant has only couple of tables as it is mainly a takeaway place. recommended for the weekly indian meals for home-sick visitors and also for those who want a change from home-cooked food."
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
euro 20  lunch udon looks like kid udon without any side dish.  there was a big dog in the restaurant and this is not good for  hygiene.  i will never visit here again.
new level of service in this restaurant. we made an order and ok sometimes mistakes can be made and some items might be wrong or forgotten. how likely is it that they will forget the full order? well they did. the waitress just didnt put it through. just like that. she didnt even come to apologise for forgetting. if you like sitting on your table forever like an idiot with no one bringing your food or coffee this is the place to com 
"first time in lpq in a’veen and never again. i normally go to groot gelderlandplein or in ams/ de pijp where service is outstanding and food is well prepared and proportions are generous.in aveen this experience is totally reversed. me and my friend ordered a caesar salad but to my great surprise it was not prepared with slices of real chicken but thin slices of cheap packaged cooked chicken slices and on some slices you could clearly see the veins. in addition the salad was full of big bacon cubes which had an overbearing taste in the salad.while we were eating our meal we were asked to change tables in order to allow a bigger group to take a seat! then there is the noise problem , since tables are very close to one another you do not have sufficient space and therefore lack privacy.nevertheless i maintained a calm demeanor in order to not spoil the mome "
"waitresses ignore the customers, even when you call them politely they act like a deaf and don’t respo "
"it is such a pity this shop doesn’t know the basics of customer experience. after a 5 minutes wait to be seated, nobody came. even if we saw 5 waiters, nobody dared saying hello. we then left to go to hema restaurant which was a nice experience (playground for kids, nice food and not expensive at all)."
will never visit again. appalling experience compared to other stores in the franchise. recommend to avoid.
"definitely worth a visit for a quick bite, everything fresh and very good quality. usually crowded, take away to be considered"
well placed outside the amstelveen mall area close to the monday and wednesday markets. the restaurant outside area is enclosed - inside can be noisy with the wooden floor and no soft furnishings.
"pain quotidien serves great breakfast: tartines, bread and fruit.  today our experience was sub-par: the staff was not attentive (maybe they had a great party last night) and the place was full of mosquitoes. so we quickly are our food and left."
"- ingredients were high quality, but less quantity - bad server - high price location for netherlande"
only stopped in for quick snacks during a shopping visit. clearly a place which treats young families well as the place was full of young children. the snacks were not very expensive but actually were not great value : 10 euro for an incredibly average open sandwich . one of those places you put down to experience and look for an alternative next time 
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
tasty and fragrant food mostly for take away: the tables and chairs are placed there for a quick bite and are like a cantina.
"this is an ordinary grill-bar, not really a restaurant. one kind of beer, even though the menu card say otherwise. the burger is meat paste, not real minced meat."
"english menu helped with selection fried meats with fresh veggies, tasty relishes and breads. our service was great, able to answer menu questions and make recommendation."
i found myself very tired in the neighbourhood and was told this restaurant was near 
"i was staying at the amsterdam forest hotel opposite grill-bar rooz so decided to give it a try, mainly because i couldnt be bothered to walk very far after a full day of walkin "
"located in a mall (which is host to a lot of eateries) the atmosphere leaves a bit to desired. most of the restaurants area is taken up bby the open kitchen, bar and a waiting room for take-out orders, although there is presumably more seating upstairs."
we had a fish with a sweet and spice sauce that was obviously not self-made and almost identical to the one served with the spring rolls (which we didnt order). the dish felt like quickly thrown together with little attention to detail or authenticity. the vegetable green curry was overall better but also not memorable. service was mostly concerned about getting us out before 22:00 and forgot our drinks until after we were done with the food. this was our first visit and we wont return.
this place is probably only populair because there is little alternati 
"it was our anniversary night and we went for dinner. the ambiance is good, dim lit with private boot sitting and courteous staff. i tried palm beer (which was different & okay-ish) but the turn off was the similarity in dishes. the preparation was good but different curries did not taste that different. i was expecting much more. portion size is hu "

"as my parents are not very mobile, my brother decided to order in from thai from sky for fathers day. the food is tasty, not quite the island thai style i remember from kho panang, but then again: they might be from a different part of thailand. it takes 45 mins to have your food delivered, of which the drive from the restaurant would be about 10-15 minutes. so my brother planned ahead. what a shame however, that when the food was delivered, the driver handed over a bag with only two dishes out of the six ordered. unfortunately my nephew of 18 was not alert enough to notice. we called the restaurant, and the driver had dropped it off at another family, but we would get it soon they said. over half an hour later, no food had appeared. when i called, they explained they made it all over again, to explain for the late delivery. at which point i pointed out they should have told us because for elderly people, to have to wait another 45 minutes is just not going to do well for their health, also because my fathers medication depends on timely food. the woman apologized profusely. but still: we were dealt with two faint parents. when the - same - driver finally turned up, i asked him: did you not notice you were giving us only out of 2 bags. he just shrugged and said: i just deliver. i never look at the bags. yes, that was very clear. on top of that, apparently shrimp crisps are supposed to come with a delivery over a certain amount. no such thing. in short, food quite okay considering youre not in amsterdam. but having it delivered? not if you want a relaxed night."
very small portion....bit overpriced for the amount of food given. i am a big fan of thai food and been to many thai restaurants. i found food from here too blend and lacked spices. will stick to restaurants in downtown.
take-away delivery service is good. wide selection on the menu. we particularly like the thai curries
"i had tom ka gai at this restaurant. that is my favorite thai soup. previously i had tom ka gai at many restaurants in berlin and at golden bird in amsterdam. the portion of tom ka gai in thai from the sky was small, and in my opinion overpriced - 7,5e. it lacked galanga root, an essential ingredient of the soup. its flavor was off. very blend and lacking enough spices (insufficient lemon grass, not spicy at all, no chilies). the only visible vegetable was cilantro. in berlin in asia gourmet (cheap asian food merchandise)i got a big chunk of galanga, lemon grass, kafir lemon leaf, cilantro, chili, cherry tomatoes, large piece of chicken for 2,5e! my experience in thai from the sky was an utter disappointment."
tried the restaurant after new management took over. the food is pretty good and we enjoyed our meal. thai flavors are distinct and definitely there. the prices are on the higher side of the border and might be prohibitive if they go up.
we have tried both take-away and eat-in at this restaurant and the food is just okay. the tom kha gai soup is the best thing on the menu. pad thai is pretty bland. the restaurant itself is nicely decorated but it is in a really dreary little mall. prices seem high for this type of food.
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
we went here for my brother-in-laws birthda 
"this was a must visit due to being invited by in-laws. what a horrible place, disinterested staff, very noisy, very smelly, food was too fat and too salty and the place is crowded by people with the sole purpose of loading a lot of food."
"proper “twents” hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs it’s a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70’s feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still don’t understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "
"first of all, majority of restaurants in doetinchem looks bad on tripadvisor. old pictures and few reviews. i dont think its to many tourist visiting, maybe thats the reaso "
we was first time dinner for had experience is was good..after that we booked for birthday&wedding dinner but get bad experience ever🥵🥵👎👎..wait more then 45min to order.(don’t think about making foo 
"gringo’s has known times when the interior was innovative and food surprising. those times are disappearing: ambiance lively but too loud and bad acoustics. steaks lower quality than they used to be, and smaller than they used to be against higher prices. salad must have been prepared and held in the fridge for a long time: no fresh salad leaves, taste of refrigerator humidity dominating, the masking with thick dressing did not take that away.fries were nice but served not completely hot anymore. price-quality levels have gone out of balance too: price too high for what is offered. we said the salad was not tasting ok and not nice. we got apologiesand she would tell the chef. no solution offered and were fully charged. after almost 20 years of returning to gringo’s, we will have to let go of gringo’s."
we had a meal here spoilt by an obnoxious waiter who refused to give us tap water despite us having a full meal with drinks.
"used to be smaller, then they expended and became the mexican version of tgi fridays. unless you were invited i suggest you look for something else."
"dishes were over salted, had to much chemical taste enhancers, thirst, headaches and vowel aches afterwards. pity that this restaurant, once the best of town, is now only serving low cost bulk food that will lose out from any fast food joint in quality. seems togo downhill."
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
"very bad restaurant. unfriendly owner. the service in this restaurant is very bad. unfriendly, long waiting times, etc."
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di 
i have visited here quite a few times as i stay regularly at the citta romana resort in which the restaurant is situated. most occasions the service is quite slow but normally friendly staff. the menu is basic with pizza burgers chicken ribs and fish so dont expect fine dining. the food is always hot and the servings are not to bad in size and i do recommend the burger. its nice to sit outside on a summers evening but be aware that at certain times of the year there may be a lot of oil and gas workers there as the site is poplar with working nearby. i come here when i cant be bothered to cook for myself and ive never come away feeling disappointed.
food was very nice. service was slow. only managed to get one drink with our meals.  4 starters 4 mains 4 drinks 10% discount. 80 euros. not bad.  would go back. prawn cocktail is brown shrimps. tappas was really good. half chicken just that.
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
"i had to wait 30 min for my take-away meal, even if on the website it said you can pick it up in 10 min (which is a regular time for chinese take-away). after 20 min the waitress said it was because of the mihoen i ordered, which i make at home in 3 min. there were not more than 8 people in the restaurant at the time i was there and they had already finished eating. it wasnt communicated with me that it was going to take so long. the waitress didnt speak dutch or english and communication was difficult, she seemed annoyed sometimes and difficult to rea "
"earlier it was a great restaurant. this time, we went with 4 persons to have a dinner. something was full of bacterias and i was getting sick during the dinner itself and went asap to the toilet and lost all the food. other 3 got the same few hours later. pity that the kitchen isnt clean and i am wondering that they are getting allowance to serve this kind of infected food. will not go again there, pity."
"firstly the staff were very nice, however as a treat i decided to order the black angus steak at nearly 26 euros. however when it arrived it looked way too big for a fillet steak and i couldnt cut into it.....after a bit of sawing i managed to get inside and it was completely raw.....i had ordered medium. i tried chewing a piece that i managed to cut off and it went round and round in my mouth....i couldnt chew it.....so when the waitor came over he took it back to the kitchen.......then about 5 minutes later out it came again.........not sure what the difference was as again i had real difficulty in cutting it...yet again when i managed to saw off a piece it was completely raw inside..what we in britain call blue ? the waiter said that that was how they like it in the netherlands, (so why call it the british pub and why ask patrons how they would like it cooked i wonder)?? he took it away and offered a free coffee...........i said no thanks. anyway we went to pay and they had still charged for that inedible chunk of meat?... the location was great but the food was inedible and the staff, although nice, a bit useless in this situation.....an expensive mistake."
"our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, the place was comfortable but the food was very average - i ordered a stuffed pepper which was pretty much a warm, but raw pepper with a bit of veg inside and cheese melted on top."
"ate here when staying at hotel montfoort, which is 20 meters aw "
"we are no lovers of the wok-concept, but this was a good try and we liked it. specially the variety of food was great. highly meat orientated: lambsrack, few kinds of beef, even kangaroo etc. all from the grill. but also sushi made in front of your eyes. and of course the real wok dishes, we liked the szechuan sauce and the thai sauce. countles kinds of deserts, free beer and wine. downside was that some of the european dishes were blend because they were heated in trays. but you dont compe for french fries here. very kind service, but of course a total do-it-yourself concept. we call it a foodbarn, but we liked it this time."
food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
good food. ordering the tapas you are ensured that you have various dishes. due to the rounds one can choose the food is guaranteed to be warm and freshly prepared.
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."
"sorry, but poor. rooms are not well insulated, hear everythi "
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"reasonable for type of facility. buffet breakfast pricey but good. dinner, reasonable for this type of hotel. room up to date and clean. location is convenient"
"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but i’m a little disappointed by the service."
being in zaans schans where the chocolate factory is we wanted to try a hot chocolate. we asked the owner if they had local hot chocolate and he replied with “of cours 
"we came in around 2:30 pm, the restaurant was not very full and we didn’t get our food until 3:49 pm. the waitress never put in our order and forgot about it for the whole hour. a family sitting next to us came in twenty minutes after us and they received their food first, so we asked the waitress and she realized she never put it in and didn’t even bother to check on us for the past hour. due to her limited english, she apologized in a very rude way. the food was okay though, but overpriced. will not recommend to anyone. "
"i wanted soup and salad and a sandwich... mustard soup tasted too heavily of mustard from the jar, maybe it should taste like that? they didn’t understand simple greens for salad, but i did not want their entree salads that were the most expensive items on lunch menu. they did comply, serving me a few leaves in a bread bowl, which could not be cut or dressed with the delicious olive oil. i saved it for my sandwich "
"it was a beautiful, warm day and the outdoor tables were a great place for lunch. service was acceptable--attentive at first and then less so when the place filled up. burgers were good. nothing astonishing, mid-range prices. tip: it seems no one in the netherlands accepts credit or non-nl debit cards. plan to bring cash."
poor service and no guest caring. we had to leave for a certain time and they kept made late. we are not going back.
stopped in here after being dropped off by a bus tour to visit zaanse schans. we got soup (pretty sure the spinach soup had a chicken stock base so be careful vegetarians) and a sandwich. it was nice to get warm and out of the wind and rain but the food was average and the service the same.
dreadful experience at this restaurant where they refused to serve us for turning up 10 minutes late!!! the chef was shockingly rude and we will never return.
"the staff was friendly, and we ordered the menu with an ok price, the rest of the menu was quite expensive and we were surprised on how big the dishes were but how incredibly small portions were. the food was great quality but i would have needed 3 menues to fulfill my stomach and im a slim person that doesnt eat too muc "
my family and i ate 3-courses set. the starter played an important role in our dinner because they were the only edible dish 
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "
+food was tasty ant first and well presente 
"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this “brasserie” is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."
"we attended this restaurant on two occasions .the first (for a lunch) , we had a good experience. sadly the second experience wasnt so good ! we called in for an evening meal and ordered our choice > the restaurant was quite busy and we noted the owner/manager was sat near the front door observing . in fact he had been sat in that position and seat we we had been there befor "
"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at €19 each! we couldn’t finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to €46! i can’t help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. there’s many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit “quasi-rural” venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the €25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulée, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "
limited menu.  pancakes were the specialty and these were done well.  other items were average.  menu is not in english.
the lunchroom of the huisje van de zeeuw is run by the krimpenerwaard day spending foundation. it provides extra structure to the lives of people with intellectual disabilities by offering daytime activities. this is in line with the perception and ambitions of each individual participant. we enjoyed a good lunch. 
the menu was fine although the house wine wasnt nice at  
"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little café. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"we came in around 5:30 p.m., because we were going to the theater after dinner. several people already were sitting at the bar. the extremely correct hostess took us to our table. on bringing our drinks, the hostess noticed our theatre booking and reported right away that the food serving would be no problem. extremely attentiv "

last thursday i went to pempek elyssia for take away fo 
"went here for take out. ordered beef rendang, gado gado and extra white rice for one. we paid about 20 euro. the rendang was 4 small piece of meat, container of nasi and some vegetables. we were disappointed bij the amount of meat and taste. in other indonesian tokos we had better and paid less. i asked for a little bit of white rice and got the same size container as the nasi. which was for 2 persons. next time i will go somewhere else for indonesian food."
a cute little authentic indonesian restaurant. friendly owner. various foods from noodle soups to various rice dishes. the indonesian ice dessert are good. most of the time the food quality is good sometimes less. but you can always give your feedback to the owner and she will take care of it.
"we walked in at 12noon as stated opening hours at the door and was asked if we wanted to dine in or take away. my reply was take away and the lady at the counter said they dont have that kind of chinese food and they target mainly the caucasians. well, my skin is yellow and so is hers! thanks for the heads up, we missed chinese food thats why we walked in and left with loss of appetite!"
"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p. 
nice restaurant and clean.  good for lunch.  food and drinks reasonable price and service ok.  pasta with prawns and chicken sate are good.
"the interior is looking well taken care of, the service was a bit slow. that was strange because there were enough waitresses walking aroun "
this place needs new management. food and coffee (illy👌) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.
we visited here on our trip for a quick lunch near the city where our friends were marri 
"very unfriendly, rude staff. you had to wait outside, while others popped in (selective gate keeping). chaotic, unorganized."
"visited for the first time recently, as i was told their chicken cashew is super. it indeed is, delicious! service though i thought sucked, or i had a case of bad luck. in confusion about options for vegetables in the menu, the step of deciding which vegetables i’d want got skipped and before i knew what was going on i had already payed for the menu of 2meat+4vegetables + half egg, and was sent out with only nasi and chicken cashew and no vegetables or egg in the ba "
"good tasting food. they offer all-you-can eat special on weekends. nice selection of alcoholic drinks. be aware they tend to miss a dish or two, if you order 5 or more in one go, especially during weekends."
this restaurant is a nice and good variation on the asian all you can eat concept. it is all about tapas. you can choose from cold and warm dishes. both meat and fish. veggies lovers will be dissapointed here. there is not much choice for them. though the mushrooms in garlic sauce are delicious! you can have cocktails for 5 euros but better order a bottle of wine or a can of sangria. the gambas and the fish dishes were that day exceptionally good. service is friendly and adequate. this is a fine restaurant to take your kids to.
"we like tapas and mezze a lot and eat them at home and outdoors in nl and many other countries. this restaurant has an all you can eat formula, with low quality - mostly fried- food, unexperienced staff and huge cocktails filled with soda. this is not dining, but stuffing yourself with carbs and fat! "
"the service was great. food was up and down, the dishes arent all the same size. therefore you didnt really know what to expect. they make you pay for everything that is leftover. would have loved to try more different dishes. the beenham was a bit dry. but the garnalen en kaas kroketjes were amazing! "
"we ordered 2 meals ( take away). the staff were friendly, but the food was not special, seems it was lacking spices. also the meals didnt have enough ingredients (small portions with 50 gr or a bit more meat and mostly onions (not much vegetables)). rice was also less compared to other indian restaurants. the stew was basically like soup ( mainly sauce and not enough meat and vegetables). average portion was 15 euros, so not even cheap. we wont go back there."
this food is only italian for people who have never eaten italian.. low quality cooking with overcooked lasagna drowning in sauce and fast-food level pizza... profoundly disappointed
"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
great for kids but... service was lackin 
it was a nice day so the children could play outside and watch the animals while we chatted with our friends. we were there on sunday at lunchtime and the restaurant was otherwise empty! pancakes were fine but not very special.
"we visited here because we wanted to have lunch, but ordered coffee first. the waitress serving the coffee accidentally put her hand in one of the cups and spilled coffee on the saucer. she left and we thought she would come back with a new cup and to clean up but she didnt. another waitress brought the menus, and despite relatively high prices we wanted to order but then nobody showed up for fifteen minutes to take our order. so we decided to leave. not a good experience."
"this pancake house has a perfect location, enough space to park your car and bike. also, the restaurant has a large fenced-in playground/petting zoo which keeps your children happy. you can sit on the deck and enjoy the sun while the kids run around (but cant get away "
went there with the kids in the summer. the location is nice with parking space for cars and there is a small playground outside which the kids liked a l 
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesn’t seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. we’ll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be €2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
"the starter, a deep fried fish pastry , was all new to our taste and so were the korean flavoured vegetables and the fried ball containing koran rice with cheese. something new and all together different from what you know, that is why you go for something exotic like korean food, right? alas, after this promising start it turned out to be a regular bbq with regular fish, prawns, pork and steak. nothing exotic to it , except for the soy sauce and that could not make up for the missing amenities like various fatty - but-oh-so-good sauces that make a western style bbq so irresistible. also, the french fries are really bad. all in all: you can eat well and as much as you lik "
nice food but they dont take english credit or debit cards...an embarrasing end to an otherwise pleasant evening...i wont be back..
you’d think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30… but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. won’t be coming back for breakfast that’s for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10€ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"these were all due to the information on the website was not sufficient for us to make a good decision. when we planned to stay in houten, the information from the hotel only showed ‘near to the train statio "
the food that we ordered wasnt the highest quality. meet wasnt tender and the vegetables werent cooked well enough. also cold food was served on hot plates. this in combination with poor services wont let me come back ever again. 
a bizarre hipster hotel. or is it a hotel? i stayed two nights and im still not sure  
"again we had a dinner at parthenon not because we think this is top of the bill but just because we like greek food and it is nearby. friendly service, nothing wrong with the seating and a average menu, just greek food. they are trying to get some more attention by having specials but still...just greek food"
"we love greec food so we regularly go to this restaurant. the food is nice, the prices ok and the ambiance is ok too. but it is nothing very special. you just have a very nice evening with good food here."
the lamb chops were chewy and way too well done. the meats were very salty. the tsatzikki was good. the fries werent even very good or fresh and the service was bad. only came to the table once for the order and once to drop off the food.
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
the location is along the main street of doorn. we did take away but we should wait for a while as there was a long queue of people who also did take away. it seems that this restaurant is popular by the local.
"you get a list/menu and you can choose 5 snack size items, 5 times. you have to finish what you order. lots of choice, chinese and sushi. we really enjoyed this."
"this restaurant serves as the only chinese food restaurant in the neighborhood. since decades chinese restaurants in the netherlands have developed a taste that suits the dutch well. this restaurant understands this tradition well. the babi pangang is as it has to be. the take away service is good, friendly and quick. ordering by phone is possible and works well. service in the restaurant is friendly. the place is friendly for children. half portions are available."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.
chalet helenaheuvel is an ideal place to stop for drinks or lunch when exploring the beautiful kaapse bossen (forest) in the utrechtse heuvelru 
i did eat here people are not caring anyone they are not working only walking they dont care for the coustemer. also food is not so good.  i never want go again
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... don’t go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so don’t plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"well, we ordered the food by phone and picked them up from the restaurant. i was actually surprised by seeing a lot of choices on the menu in their website. however, it makes it more difficult to make a decision  "
"the drinks were generous and cheap. the food was inedible. thats all i have to say. i have had inedible food about twice in my life thats how bad it was. i would give no stars if possible. my husband and i had totally different meals and his was also awful. i ordered a salad which never came probably good my husbands salad was disgusting, watery. plus we waited 30 minutes for our food with no one in the restaurant!"
"very nice prices at this restaurant. it has italian food plus mexican, pizza, and a good mixture of other entrees. i had a glass of house wine for $3.50 and canneloni for $9.50. max entrée price was under $20."
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"great place to be on a sunny day. very comfortable lounge furniture invites to relax when having a drink. felt very well here with my friend. unfortunately my caesar salad was absolutely disappointing, made without any touch of effort. some leaves of salad, few eggs and fried chicken. no capers, no anchovy’s and sauce without any taste.."
"arrived at 2pm waiting for 20min and asked 6 times to place my order. after i went to the bar for a 2nd time, someone found the decency to follow me to our table to take the order. 30mins passed in the meantime. another 30mins until the food came out. food was extremely disappointing and wonder why two slices of bread with salmon and the other with tuna takes 30min? the visit ended with waiting for 20min for the bill. in the meantime people around us left without paying. staff though was very friendly. i felt sorry for them. they were doing their best but they obviously have a manager who has no clue how to manage and plan for a busy summer day. i will not go again..."
"ive bough a ticket for an event at this venue. arriving at the location, the customers are confronted with a mandatory toilet charge already at the door. if you refuse to pay, they will not let you in and the money that you have paid for the event will be forfeit. never again. i am surprised people never wrote about this here."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
"we were with a group and had to wait quite a long time for our food. the waiter (owner) of the restaurant was constantly asking if we wanted more drinks, it almost felt like they in purpose prolonged our stay to make us pay as much as possible. the food wasnt that bad, but not great either. especially for the price we had to pay. in the end i payed like €90,- for me and my girlfriend. for some people this doenst sound like much. but my friends had to pay a lot more, mostly for the drinks because we were waiting so long for our food. i dont want to bash to hard on the restaurant, maybe we just had a bad expierence and it has since been better. but im not recommending the place to go at all."
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. don’t go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and it’s just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and it’s close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the décor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"terrible for the price you pay. id rather go to an all you can eat restaurant where they serve the food to you. even though some dishes where prepared by the chefs immediately, everything is bland and tastes like garlic. we were done within 1 hour and went to another restaurant. this is great for groups or when you dont mind to eat food that has been prepared 3 hours ago."
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
"we had a nice evening chatting, eating and drinking. however apart from the kroketten nothing outstanding, actually all the meat not cooked very well (nobody asked how we wanted it), or maybe not the best quality, and all rice served in paella etc very porridge like and overcooked, little fresh vegetables. servers all very nice, kitcen a bit sloppy as we asked for no curry sauces and still got it.... drinks quite pricy not to say expensive for such a place. even served water only by the bottle and paid (tap water would have been fine. all over spent nearly 30 euros pp on food and 10 euros on drinks which is not a little for such a place. nevertheless had a nice evening and reservations and table fine."
"with tapas i would have expected spanish food, but its a fusion of dutch, asian and italian foid in small portions. some are great, some are mediocre. environment is nice and service is quick."
"the all you can eat menu includes a lot of dishes which are all average. nothing is really good, and all the tastes used are familiar. this made it unappealing, especially when comparing the food quality with the prices. some of the staff were friendly, some not. the decoration of the restaurant is nice but the details are not (e.g. usage of a cheap bench). for this location and price, we expected way better food."
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
this isnt the worst chinese food i have ever eaten but also certainly not the best. it appears like all food comes with the same sauces which creates 1 single flavour amongst all dishes. the babi pangang was roasted very well though.
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand café with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
"not bad if you got a craving but very salty food, everything is dialled to 11 in salt. got the mixed greek plate, around 300g of meat. some chips, rice and salad on side, but no pita unfortunately."
i had my dinner with my colleague tonigh 
the service is very friendly but the food wasnt great. we think that the chef might have had an off night cause this place was recommended as being very good. they did take our comments on board so next time we hope that the meat wont be so dry and not everything out of a tin.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the ‘reibekuchen’ were great. the ‘zuurvlees’ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
the restaurant is located in the center of vaa 
"basic, though quite authentic greek cuisine. lots of choice, and the portions were too much for us to finish. friendly staff. decoration is a bit basic and a bit kitch."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
"the place was busy, but i dont understand why. ordered nasi and sate and my wife ordered a chicken nasi plate. hers was ok. my pork skewers were so tough i couldnt cut them with a knife. sent it back and didnt replace the order. had some of the chicken nasi instead. perhaps we should have stuck with traditional chinese dishes. disappointing."
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
"nice place and terrace, great set-up, very good meats. poor service, slow and rude, maybe tired at the end of their morning shift."
"we had dinner here on a beautiful summer evening. as expected the wines were very good. the food somewhat mediocre and not always matching the quality of the wines. but we were mostly annoyed by the several flies in the restaurant, many were stuck on the ceiling, one death fly fell on our table. we had a good laugh about it but i does not suit the restaurant. "
"on base of our last great experience we visited the bistro of the salentein again but now it was a disappointment. it took too long we were being served. we ordered a good bottle of wine and a carafe water from the tap (like last time) but this time another waitress told us that it was strictly forbidden to serve (free) water from the tap. we had to ask for bread which came too late. the worst of all was the smoke from the open kitchen where steaks were to baking. the waitress had to open the outside door close to us to get rid of the smoke and of course the cold came in. the food was really ok but till today our cloches are smelling of those steaks!! last time it was great, this time it was the opposite. we dont know if there will be a third time. "
"it has nothing special to offer , except for a good restaurant . but overrated and no great cooking . only usefull for doing business , not for holidays."
"having grown up in this area, the salentein always had that magical ring of being out of reach of the common folk, due to its supposed exquisit cuisi "
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
"visited here with a group of friends. the place packs 600 people, who are scattered over the place. once youre seated you dont notice that much, but when you want to get freshly prepared food at either the wok/teppanyaki or green egg station, youll have to stand in line. there are plenty of choices for either starters, main course and desserts, even out-of-the-ordinary things like crocodile, shark and kangaroo. because of the long lines i didnt even try these out and settled for the already finished dishes. the food is plenty, they keep bringing in fresh, but in my opinion its not spectacular. just goo "
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost €12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than €1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for €12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
located in a small town in friesland right on a little river. this italian restaurant offers typical dishes like pasta and piz 
a fine italian restaurant. do not expect haute cuisine. but thats fine. just a no-nonsense italian restaurant. with surprising dishes and pizzas
"we ate here after a long day of travel.  dined on the special, which was a doner type meal not as good as doner joints."
"i chose this restaurant by chance and just from the look of it i expected some special asian food. very friendly staff, very modern and clean restaurant. „just“ the food did not meet my expectations. i have to admit that i am traveling to hong kong frequently and expect more than just european style convenience chinese food. it was ok, but had nothing to do with authentic chinese food. dim sum as a starter and spicy beef as main course. sorry.. not for me. once again, if you like to have a nice evening in a well decorated restaurant with a good service and „european“ chinese food this is a good place. "
"came here for too many times, apparently people in the area think that this is the best restaurant for chinese/ japanese cuisine. yet we experienced another disappointing day, this time we ate the teppanyaki. the beef and seafood tasted like frozen meat and they are definitely overpriced. they delivered the wrong dishes by mistake but waiter insisted that we must pay because we have eaten some of it and this was the order of the female owner. we always came with big group of family and expected good things since its always been recommended by family member, but we never tasted decent good food from the price that we paid for. never ever come here again!"
"i came with family. friendly staff but some order was not correctly made like my wonton soup came as a sweet and sour soup, some wine on the menu were not available... the beef and lobster were nice though but peking duck is very dry and overpriced, one of the worst peking duck ive ever had! i could make a better fu yung hai myself at home than theirs... i cannot remember the other dishes as they are very average (chicken, fried fish, etc)... they make this place as a fancy restaurant but they dont deliver the same quality of what you paid for."
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "

"good middle class hotel. very often dance and party in the backroom-no problem for guests. romoms rather small and not to new, but all is there. showgrössen was leaking, seems nobodys problem. stayed one week-showergel, tissues and so on was never stockt up, pity. staff friendly, breakfeast nice. "
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast €12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars. "
visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!

"we have been visiting hillegom for years, and this relatively new restaurant is one of several owned by the same people. it is a retro design, modeled on a nearby art deco building, which is pleasant. most of the dining was in an upstairs balcony, looking down over the salon or bar area. only part of the upstairs was open, and a good thing too as there was only one server for the entire place and she was extremely bu "

"first time visit. the overall atmosphere and setting, both inside as well as outside is very pretty and welcoming. very friendly service with a smile makes you feel at ease instantly. however an attempt has made to make it look exclusive, say a bit haute cuisine "
"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
"having only a single vegetarian main course does not make you “vegetarian friendly”. and the curry itself was not very tasteful neither, especially when compared to real indian cuisine. please, make a bit more effort in offering several choices."
"we had heard good recommendations about the food but were very disappointed by the very unfriendly almost rude manager on duty... i understand corona is a stressful situation especially for restaurants, but no need to be rude to customers... because of this behavior we decided to eat somewhere else (see my review of fletcher hotel schoorl restaurant). sorry for this review... we might try it again post corona... but for now i won‘t recommend this."
guess it was quiet here because of the off season timing. this place next to the beach would probably be packed at summer. quite costly but well prepared food. nice decorations and good variation on seating. cannot seat a big group together.
we were in the area & stopped in for lunch. we didnt have reservations so were asked to sit at the bar/counter. we ordered tomato soup & broccoli soup of the day along with some other simple items. we were surprised at how long it took to get our entrees. we all agreed that we have had better service & soups.
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.

"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (€12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, don’t even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
"terrible service, we had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and the menu. the waiters were not paying any attention at all and were very slow."
i had lunch with my family here very recently. i think it is more attractive in the summer than the winter. the food was good and the service adequate. they must pride themselves in being dog friendly which is great - up to the point where some dogs take a disliking to one another and let all the others know it.
"nice place at the beach, with decent food and good service. not a standard scruffy beach restaurant of bar, but definately above."
"bought three takeaway meals here and they were tasteless. bought chicken satay - watery tasteless sauce and the chicken pieces were tasteless, also bought a chicken chow mein - this dish was also watery and tasteless, also bought gado gado ….. this was absolutely nothing like a decent meal - again a watery tasteless mess ! to accompany the dishes we bought a loempia….turned out to be a poor quality item from a frozen food compa "
"quick service but soggy gloopy noodles with nothing fresh about it, wouldnt recommend better than school dinners!"
"food is ok, fairly average dutch/ indonesian/ chinese that you get here, all cooked (or zapped) in about 5 seconds, all tastes the same as everywhere else but i quite like it especially if i’m hung "
"terrible food. charged me twice as much as the cost of what i ordered. i argued, but no help. the lo mein has green peppers in it which ive never seen in real chinese lo mein... the noodles were bland especially for 16 euro."
the dishes can be very good if you are specific about your wishes. the chicken with black bean sauce and szechwan shrimp are both good.  the owners speak good english so communicating goes well.

"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "

fabulous food but sooo expensive we had a takeaway and the portions were large but paid £65 for four dishes 😳😳😳
"we ate siu la ngau lau sie and  kon po ngau pin  . it looked colourful and nice. but only the vegetables tasted good. the meat was tasteless, unrecognisable. we doubted if it really was tenderloin. what a pity. the only thing i can recommend are the baked bananas. staff was indifferent."

"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didn’t get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you can’t book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz

"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"

fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"it‘s a fastfood restaurant. decent seating outside. definitely the cheapest alternative in the area. food is ok, but nothing special. just a place for a quick bit for reasonable prices"
had a quick bite to eat at the restaura 
"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."

"we missed to reserve a table at one of the beach restaurants so we went to billy bob. the place was crowded so we waited for 1,5 hours to get 1 steak, 2 spare ribs and 2 burgers. thats was no problem. when they served the food only the steak was hot - really everything else was cold. literally cold. we told them its cold and wheter they could warm it up. they did it without saying sorry. we felt like bad guests. we ordered, because we were hungry, another cup of fries and some drinks. we just had a little cup of salad and one and a half cups of fries for everyone! everyone had to get fries and a salad - ist was written in the menu. it wasnt like that. when we get our food the second time. it was cold aga "

"as most customers are either dutch or german, there is no information in english, which makes the ordering challenging for those that rely on english. we were a group of nine. those that ordered pancakes were for the most part satisfied. the rest of us not so much. there are other restaurants nearby, of which i can at least recommend the italian one. to say something positive, the website is well designed and there is a playground outside."
"dont quite get the concept of italian tapas. italian food is wholesome, its filling and plentiful. if youre hungry the small platters and having to order from a limited menu will frustrate you. oh and you have to write down your order and hand it to the waitress...🙄"
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasn’t bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."
"food quality was poor. rice with the pokébowl was served as one big sticky bal. after feedback to the kitchen no excuse, nor any compensation was offered."
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really don’t understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
"food not too bad, but when we were not sure if we should order dessert or not, their reaction in dutch was not very polite - they just didnt realise we understood the lingo! too bad we did..."
"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to €10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend €50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste. "
"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5€ (the wine only cost 10€). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldn’t go there again. "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin café. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."

"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit ‘too much’. pick one of the more ‘traditional’ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"five employees were taking to each other at the bar, yet no one really seemed to notice i was there. the food tasted good, but seemed a bit wee for the money (€6,25)."
setting is lovely and staff are friendly and professional. but the food promises more than it delivers. homemade lemonade wasnt and a caesar salad had no chicken at all and a very anchovy heavy mayonnaise dressing. its a shame as the potential is huge. maybe we caught them on an off day? 
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"had dinner at het heerenlogement with a couple of ex colleagues. upon arrival, the fireplace was burning and there was a cosy atmosphere. they have a nice menu with a couple of good dishes, however, it was somewhat unfortunate not everything was available. the wine list was okay, albeit they didnt have a pinot gris which is a quite common wine to serve. prices for the food were decent; for the wine i found prices somewhat elevated. all in all it was a good dinner."
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but won’t eat there again!
"my very first chinese restaurant in the netherlands and the first impression is good. the food was quite decent and tasted authentic, given that ive been to many restaurants in hong kong and taiwan. the restaurant itself is quite big but was relatively empty during the day. mind you, it was quite a cold day with ice on the road, which might explain it. the lighting in the restaurant is a dim so i found it slightly difficult to see the food clearly. adding a lazy susan to the table wouldve made sharing the dishes much easier. otherwise, the food tasted quite authentic."
"going to a chinese restaurant or getting chinese food from the take-away, which is almost always attached to the restaurant is sort of a habit in the netherlands. free parking is also nice with the colossal hourly rates in the city center parking facilities. that is why i try from time to time chinese restaurants in the suburbs to find the kind of chinese restaurant i will gladly return to. however, chinese restaurant rose garden was no revelation. granted, parking was free in the street and the staff was welcoming and polite, albeit a bit slow. the restaurant is clean and light, but a discordant was the slot machine in full view, complete with gamblers. furthermore, a table at the window means a view of a filling station and the multilevel car park next to the spaland shopping center. the food was obviously prepared with dedication, but, in my opinion, too much cooking oil was used for the preparation. i must admit that i am spoiled through my numerous visit to malaysia, but i cant write an enthusiastic review about the food served at the rose garden. it is average at best. so i am still searching for that special chinese restaurant, where you can say when the thought strikes you: lets go tonight."
good location - 9/10 nice ambiance - 7/10 friendly staff - 7/10 average food quality - 5/10 value - 7/10 expected a better quality of food

"it’s a typical indian restaurant with a rich selection of dishes and a set menu at a low price. the service is very slow and something gets missed in the way. the food is abundant, not memorable but not bad."
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they aren’t attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasn’t friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldn’t answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help they’d just say “i am the wrong person to ask”. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "
"i visited my hometown beek last month, and went to this restaurant three times. two times for lunch and once for dinner. it is definitely a hot spot for bikers and hikers. the restaurant has a very nice terrace with a beautiful view. the windmill next to the restaurant is a very nice attraction. there are tours to view the windmi "
"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
small restaurant for lunches in the shopping center den hof in waalre. the interior is a little bit cold and the place noisy due to bad acoustics. the food is not bad but a bit overpriced. service is ok.
"pleasantly surprised by my local brasserie. nice food, good size portions, friendly staff, fair price. atmosphere was fine, staff was polite and clearly local, it was not so busy when we were there."
"outside seating is nice, inside a bit cold. quality of the lunch is good, service good too. just fine for a quick lunch."
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay € 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; it’s just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck  
"after visiting the branche café in amersfoort which served perfect sandwiches, we decided to try this location as wel "
delivery was extremely late and no timely updates!   hard to get in touch with customer service.  would not recommend
"the restaurant looks nice and welcoming, but dont be fooled.the quality of the food is not in relation to the price. we picked up an average meal for 6 people which cost almost twice as much as the nearby toko (where the food is tastier and more authentic). this was my second and last time at pasar makan: i was very disappointed."
over priced over rated and poor value for money. i feel i have wasted €45 the food was not good could hardly distinguish between between slop on my plate.  all sauce very little meat.
"i was told its a good t restaurant but the good was rather disappointing. went there with hubby and 3,5 year old daughter on my birthday and were not so excited. it all tasted quite the same. we couldnt recognize the ingredients and flavors. as if everything was from the same pot. food not so kids friendly, unless youve trained your kid for such tastes. we never revisited."
"the nan (bread) they bring you at the beginning is great. the main courses had the same tomato-based sauce, only the one was sweet and the other wasnt. the girl that waited us was just adorable and super friendly. if id go back it would be for her hospitality and to try something else to prove me wrong."
ive never experienced so rude persons. its also far from city center and small portions and if you want more: not possible. this is a restaurant you should definitely not visit.
"sometimes come here with colleagues; food and service are up to standards; wide range of choice available. interior is a bit lackluster, but all in all a decent place to have a meal! not too expensive either."
"this is a typical chinese restaurant with the traditional dishes. the service is fast and efficient. the food is good, but nothing special. portions are big enough to share, or have it boxed for the other day."
i went there with my partner. the choice was limited. the food grossly overpriced for a run down old and cheap furniture decorated dump like this. it will cost you little less than 80€ for two without wine. their house wine is plonk of the worst sort and expensive. the service is deplorable and sl 
"i paid €35,75 for this peace of dump! these guys are thiefs!!!! this is what you get, apparently the owner thinks this is normal! please get out of restaurant business!!!"
"an indian place which doesnt have good vegetable dishes (with fresh ingredients) is really disappointing; my mushroom dish was made with mushroom from the can and the vegetable jalfrezi was not tasting good...indeed the choice for meateaters is better and my company liked their tandoori, but as a big fan of indian cuisine i was disappointed."
"we have been here twice and the first experience was great all round. the 2nd time we came it was busier. i immediately be came clear that everything was about money. they had placed multiple tables practically touching each other in order to fit more customers, even though the restaurant was not completely full. they also force us to order 2 main curry meals as apposed to one main, to share, along with a mix of different starters, breads and other options (this is what we did on our first visit) furthermore they then refused to serve tap-water, even after we had already ordered other drinks. this attitude completely ruined the experience for us and we will not go back again."
"the title speaks for itself, such a horrible experience. the hotel owner did not even had the courtesy to do damage control in any sense! not worth explaining or writing more about my/our dining."
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because it’s close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, i’ve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but i’d rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so i’d like them better"
"pizza was nice, thin and crispy. but seafood spagetti was not fresh and too much garlic, not to my like."

"this restaurant has always been a favorite with tasty, authentic dishe "
"this restaurant, situated in the heart of charming, water-rich maassluis, operates under a french name, monsieur paul. however, they offer a typical english dish, high tea. this high tea consists of tea in several flavours, sandwiches and as piece de resistance, an etagere with a variety of sweet food, pastries, scones, chocolates, you immediately associate with england. so far so good. the tea tasted good and the food was of good quality. however, i will never get used to the ambiance and service in dutch restaurants. the tables were so small that there was barely room for the etagere, teapot and two cups. furthermore, the tables were so close together that i had to be careful not to swipe my neighbours teacup from his table. and the service of the staff. the dutch are not so good in making customers welcome, compared to staff in other countries. oh, the waitresses were friendly, but serving customers is a profession, even an art and, what i remarked, the dutch havent mastered this yet."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"we ate here with a group of 9 people (incl. children). overall the food had good flavors and was prepared nicely. the place was very crowded and i found it too crowded. tables are packed in as much as they can, which is an effective use of space. but it does mean you have to be careful when moving out of your seat and wiggle past othe "

"cucina elena is located in vleuten, very close to vleuten train station. this is not a place for tourists but for locals who are either regulars or candidates to be regulars. we arrived at cucina at 17:35-17.40 and ordered 2 pizzas. we got our pizzas at 18:00. for a place which only has 4 tables inside (1 of them was empty when we ordered), this is really really long. the place is quite small so on a cold day, it might be chaotic with all the people who wait inside and there is no place to move, also for the staff. we arrived home and the pizzas are already got half-cold (we traveled by car for 6 minutes) . the crust around the pizza was so hard it was breaking and hurting your mouth when you bite. last but not least, according to the quattro formaggi description, i was expecting to taste gorgonzola which i did not at all. actually all i could taste was simple cheese "
this restaurant functions as an elevated fastfood joint with gourmet pric 
terrible restaurant! the food is bad and extremely expensive for what you get. broodje oude kaas costs 8 euro and all the ingredients are straight from the supermarket!
"very weird restaurant in the middle of maxima park, the biggest park in utrecht. no restaurant around for atleast a kilometer, maybe thats why such service. scores of people with children, looking for food in the par "
if this restaurant wasn’t the only place for families taking their kids to the park it would be out of busines 
"we’ve been to this place, not because we prefer it, but because of its location and amazing summer views of nature and pa "
nice location but the service is very bad! it took so long that somebody was coming to take your order. it was not even crowded.
because this is the only place in the maxima park they have a monopoly position. service is horrible and there is no structure. 30 mins wait for 3 hit chocolate and a coffe 
"after a walk, we sat down in this restaurant for a drink. the waiters were very young and inexperienced but tried very hard. the drinks were poor (wine, beer). the snacks were ok. the restaurant has a nice setting and decor but was packed with families, so having a relaxing drink was out of the question.."
"personnel is rude and very unwelcoming. i went cycling and forgot water at home so stopped here for a snack and to drink some water. the waiter was not very helpful and basically told me to find myself a table outside (it was completely empty inside, but apparently not possible to find a spot for one person) i sat outside, a very rude young female waitress came and took my order refusing to speak english even when it was clear that i could not speak dutch. i finally got my cache and the water. i paid wuivkly because i did not want to be there much longer and she grabbed my half full glass of water that i wanted to drink yo make space for next customers. i had to grab my glass and tell her i was not finished. she left the glass and proceeded to seat a family of 4 people at my table while i was still sitting and finishing my water. i usually don’t complain about service in restaurant but this was just a bit too much! really unacceptable behavior. don’t go there unless you are dutch and very blond."
"26th dec, lunch with 11 persons. the food was not good. i would not recommend eating here. food was so bad i did not even bother to take any pictures. very dissatisfied with the food. the staff however was very friendly. the service of a tuktuk’ was the best experience. "
"3 euro for 200 ml of ice tea. though the exterior is nice. food is only ok. service as well, below average. they were busy and took us some time till our order was filled."
"we ordered the high tea and although there were loads of staff around, no one was available to serve us.   the high tea itself was just ok. its a shame because the park is fantastic."
"nothing much to add to the other reviews. my fiancee and i go here occassionally for a drink on a weekday. its nicely situated in the park and its great to look out on all the activity which happens. when its not that busy, its not bad at all. you just need to make sure youre heard. if you have some dutch directness in you, youll be fin "
"anafora is situated in the maximapark and its location is wonderful for an afternoon of relaxing or going out with the kids as they have a large play yard next to the restaurant. the service is lacking customer focus though and the food is not more than ok. if you are looking for a place to drink i would recommend this restaurant, otherwise there are other restaurants in the vicinity that have better food."

a nice typical dutch cafe/restaurant located on the wate 
"this is a wonderful place to take a break from a bike ride. the restaurant has an outdoor terrace with service adjacent to the main building. in the back, across a narrow lane and right on the water is a simple dock over the river angstel, with seating and self service - you place your order at a window and are called when it is ready for pick-up. no frills, but the views over the meadows cant be beat."
"fish mixed platter was all.frozen breadcrumed food. nothing fresh. 65 euro for a handful of deep fried snacks from the wholesalers. found part of plastic bag in our cole slaw. call the staff, never even apologized or offered some form of service. just that she would show the chef. took the salad away and never replaced it. mixed grill platter was a disaster, dry met, reheated giros, very tough lam chop. baklava supposed to be greek signature dish. was not made fresh but store bought and of very poor quality. very disappointing experience. this place has been there too long, decor is 45 years old and so is their menu. staff tired and not interested. dont go there."
close to hotel carlton in walking distane. food compared what you get is expensive. taste okay but nothing special.
"different set menus to share. some of them were good some very average. fish was ok, prawns not very good. chicken is nice,..soups are fine."
"was staying at the carlton president in utrecht for a trade show and wandered down to this restaurant one evening.  decor was nice, but food was average and pricey.  a single noodle dish was the equivalent of us $19.00."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.
"after a bad experience at tante liens some years ago, i visited this indonesian restaurant again with a friend because i remembered the food as good...just the service as lou "
"the starters were really nice, freshly baked bread, nice carpaccio and salad "
"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."
we arrived hungry and had to wait 15 minutes to get any attention in a restaurant with only 3 tables ful 
"we just had a quite drink here before visiting the castle. the place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. the staff is friendly but it is an understatement to say that the so-called espresso is really underwhelming. if you want a decent coffee, better to have it in the castle itself."
"right in front of the castle cannenburch in vaassen the location of this restaurant is amazing! the food is good, the staff is young and seems inexperienced."
"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "

"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   i’d have coffee again but i’d leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.
no star. but star prices. amuses. 15 per glas. very young personnel. so where is the change. basically the same as in the past but higher prices.
"the expectations to this place was bigger than the experience. the food and wine was okay, apart from a wines that did not match the sweetness of the desert. the staff tried their best, but there were too few waiters on too many tables. this dragged the whole experience down, as we had to wait very long between each serving. price was ok."
"it wasnt really spectacular. perhaps we xpected too much but sometimes the experiments in the nouvelle cuisine are overdone. the taste is still the most important. a very big wine card and i must admit the sommelier gave us good advise. we dont want the wine included menu and so his advise was necessary. the personnel is very friendly as well, but the result wasnt as expected"
"whilst i cannot deny that the food at la trinite is fantastic, unacceptable service and unprofessional staff means that this restaurant does not warrant michelin star stat "
"before they moved to their current location, we went multiple times and had always had a good time. we were a party of four, and decided last minute to go have dinner at their new location. we were quite early, compared to other parties. we had an aperitif and received some appetizers that, we thought, gave a good first impression. we chose the menu, and were extremely disappointed by the portions. first of all they were very small and it took a long time before the dishes followed. we were set first at table and ended with the last table set. we had to wait a long time, we had to eat a lot of bread to feel satisfied, not ok! also the main course, pigeon, was served with almost no vegetables, too bad. we had ordered an extra dish, the beemster xo (10€ extra) and hoped for an original preparation of it. instead we received 5 pieces of cheese with some mustard (again disappointed, for a 1 star michelin you have other expectations "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garçon served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.
"where should i start : slow and rude service, wrong orders, uncooked and cold food which is ridiculously overprice "

wanted to dine with my 2 kids and my wife unfriendley person told kitchen is closed but dozen of people inside perhaps i have to wear a suit next time! not happy not smart not familyfriendly not to recomend!
have been several times to this family owned business in the lovely center of to 
"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 € had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50€ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40€."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!
we had a bongo luxe breakfast with bubble 
we came here with the intention of having breakfast with 6 peop 
"really bad place to have dinner. we went there on a friday night to have a meal. been there a couple of times before with the kids for coffee and ice cream, and since the make over looked like an appealing place to have a me "
"our kids love their large play garden, so the arrogant service by the waiters and the management fades away when you see the smile on your kids fa "
"very stingy : we were two and first ordered a large pot of tea (for 2 pers.) but they refused to bring an extra cup, because the boss wants every client to order a drink... !!! incredible and so shameful. "
"we have been going to this restaurant on various occasions over the last 2 years, weve seen the service deteriorating over time (as ive also read in the other reviews "
we just ate a pancake/waffle on their quite nice terrace (full of noisy kids but i didnt mind that da 
"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
we sat down for a quick bite. we got so much more.. it was very good. see below the picture of the tortillas.
"i was here for a lunch, light soup and meatkrokets. the peesoep was very good but the meat was not so present in the croquets i ve got served , nice salad aside and fresh bread. still a good place to go, for sandwich or meal."
"the restaurant has a wonderful location and looks very pretty inside. we selected the place based on the tripadvisor reviews but failed to realize that (late) in the afternoon we only get the lunch menu. after our disappointment, we still decided to stay. the menu was more like a magazine and was only in dutch (i was quite surprised to find the lack of english menus in quite a few places – needless to say, in most places the wait staff could translate the menu for us). the food was ok but nothing special. what annoyed us –and apparently other guests too – that we had to wait an awful lot for both the food and the bill. maybe, the high ranking of the restaurant is due to the food that is served in the evening."
"the day menu was quite ok for its price. the fries and fish were nice, but i didnt feel completely full after the meal. all in all an ok place, but not the best."
"terrible, slow service.  wanted to try several tapas, but was ignored so long that could only try one of the dishes.  i did have dessert. the helado de caleta, a mix of ice cream, caramel,  and 43 liquor, was delicious."
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
nice experience but maybe too many little dishes trying to impress ending up filling the guest too much. some of the dishes had very nice combinations (especially one with salmon and caviar) but i did not make it to the dessert or the cheeses which looked appealing precisely because of the too many amuse-bouche 
"went there a few times, location very nice, interior and setting average to poor! food is so, so, no feeling of genuine cooking more convenience cooking. although the staff is friendly the whole place is average."
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."
"when you are very hungry it is a good adress to eat price/quality is good. sometimes you have to wait a little wile,friendly personel"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
"been several times and it was always great, both food and service. the service was then always taken care of by an experienced lady and young man (both latin?). so far so go "
yes the spare ribs of the house are quite ok. and the service was relaxed and friendly. the location is fi 
"quite a small restaurant, service was very slow. we got a free round of drinks after complaining to management for the length of time it was taking for our meals to arrive. we only ordered a main course because it took to long to arrive. we were the first to arrive in the restaurant and another table after us was served before us . when our food was finished we sat with empty plates in front of us for quite some time before they were cleared. the food was tasty but expensive. staff not that friendly. no atmosphere of the food culture served. "
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of €17,-. fries cost €6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"a family italian restaurant, not so bad. food was ok, but the place is really oldated. prices are reasonable"
"so hard to resist the apple pie and when we were cycling past the menu board at lely, we had to stop! morning tea time anyway! lovely al fresco area in an open town square,with plenty of seating, very attractive flower baskets and pots, added to the atmosphere. friendly staff too all made for a pleasant interlude, and glad we stopped here."
"the pancakes were quite nice averaging 13 euro each however the service was slow, we waited ages for the menu, then the ordering then the pancak "
"pleasant outside seating area. slow service, despite screen camera showing outside being available to internal staff. good service and value for money. negative in that whilst near the end of our coffee the staff stood and waited for us to finish, ie. it felt that you were being rushed."
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice. "
"in this place i had possibly the worst burger (and meal!) ever! in my opinion overpriced, we paid 48€ for two burgers and a kid menu. the burger was small and not good quality and some of the fries were burnt. absolutely not recommended."
"i ate at stach march 2015 during a business trip. the staff was friendly, service quick and the salad was very good. a very dutch restaurant with clean modern lines, lots of windows and black frames. very relaxing. a cool thing is that they have a little grocery with take away lunches, sandwiches, curry, soups, and lots of chocolate!!!!"
this is a good beach club with decent food and drinks. not special or exceptional compared to other beach clubs but never the less good place to stop for a coffee.
we went to san blas and had a dinn 
"very nice decoration, and the the place be itself have a good locati "
"visited on one of te last evenings of summers, chose sans blas for it’s location and the up and coming sunset only to be totally disappoint "
"good location, easy to reach since it is the first restaurant at the entrance to the beach. drinks were good, but the panamanian food was not even close to what we experienced in panama itself. not sufficient staff, we were not able to get the attention to order a dessert."
waited 45min to be served. after chasing the waiter i did get served but no one cleaned my table for almost 90min. food arrived cold and i was waiting for it another 45 min
"my family and i walked into san blas to have some drinks and possibly dinner. its a lovely spot overlooking the beach. we had to wave down the servers who both seemed surprised to see us even though they were clearly open for business. they took our drink order and then we had to ask if they were serving food and request a menu....again, our very young and seemingly inexperienced server was happy to oblige but seemed surprised by our request of a menu at a restaurant. the four of us opted for a couple of appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party of 14. before they arrived, we astutely decided to pay our bill and go elsewhere for dinner. we just felt we would overwhelm the poor girl if we tried to order dinner for 14 even though there was plenty of room for us."
ssn blas is a horrible place with crap food and terrible service. i would give it 0/5 if it was possible.
"weve been looking for a table for 2, and found a table inside while outside it was fu "
the gnocchi was way too overpriced and contained almost no mushrooms and artichoke. the heineken we received was a small airplane bottle (25cl) which is just scammy for the price we paid. sad!
there was no english menu! the waiter had to explain all the dishes to us! food was ok. very crowded
"waiting 30 minutes at the table until the waitress tells you they have too much orders so she’s not allowed to take new ones for another 15 minutes.... in the meantime, the tables are not even cleaned up...."
"panamanian-themed beach bar/restaurant. pleasant outdoor dining on a good day. however,lunch choice very limited.and some dishes not very filling. best choice-spicy pulled chicken."
"here the good thing is the large choice of types of seatings. sofas benches or chairs with tables, in the sun or shade or even inside, all the in a very nice atmospher "
san blas is a cozy restaurant at the beach and that is mostly what is about for me. they have nice decoration with details referring to panamá (probably the name has to do with one of the countrys island 
"nice location, quite nice fish. but young waitress pourred wine over jacket, jeans, backpack. no one came to apologize, forgot to bring new glas of wine, asked us, what we would like them to do... ?! kind of wrong attitude towards guests. if they would have brought some coffee/sweets on the house, everything would have been ok. at the end no one really seemed to be interessted in solving the situation. at least our wine was taken off the bill. sadly, chef waitress was very aggressive in the end..."
this beach pavilion is very close to the parking place in bloomendal and can be reached without a long wa 
"weve been to san blas a couple of times. the food they is not so great, the service could be more attentive, and the house parrot in the restaurant is annoying. but ... san blas is a great (and the only) beach place to stop for holtkamp cakes. sea view, good coffee and a great tasting piece of cake. well come back for that (alone)."
"had lunch and ate some mackerel fish, foccacia mozzarella and croquettes. mackerel was very nice rest was just fine, nothing special. just a nice place for normal prices in comparing to the other restaurants in the neighbourhood. staff is very young and needs to be more hospitable and pay more attention to the guests but unfortunately thats a common problem nowadays...."
"it is a nice location at the beach, but.... you have to be very patient and wait a long time before you get your drinks. my partner got his beer quick enough but after half an hour my coffee arrived. then another 20 minutes before our apple pie arrived, it tasted good but was difficult to eat because of the small pastry dish and the low table were we s "
"came to this restaurant after a very disappointing experience next door. we were served quickly just before things got busy. waitress spoke several languages which was pleasant, menus available in english, german and dutch (we were a dutch/german party). drinks arrived quickly but food took a while. when a member of staff was flagged down he said he would check but never returned. asked another waitress and she said there has been an error and food should arrive shortly. all in all we waited over 45 mins for our food because of these errors, no excuse offered. however, i think this was a genuine error, it was a nice day with almost all tables occupied, staff was just unable to cope with the peak times. the food is tasty and the portions are large. drinks were nice and service pleasant. out of the 3 restaurants that i know at this location this is my favorite. "
nice location and the food was ok but we had to wait 1 hour for a simple breakfast. clueless waiters!
"the service was so poor, we waited 15 min to order and another 15 min for our difficult order. 2 heineken beer ;-) in bottles ;-) the food was delivered with so much love on the neighbors table, so we decided to leave. best idea we had. beer is about 3.50 euro, i better do not think about food prices. but the way, beer prices where not on the menue, so its a suprise what you pay in the end. oh, i nearly forgot the dj, his records hang 3 times while we were visiting. i think, he pays tribute to the service ;-)"
"had dinner here with friends. despite the fact that it was super busy due to the nice weather, the staff was pretty quick, attentive and sweet (even though they mustve been having a hectic day) the food however is dreadfull... seriously €14 for a salad with overcooked couscous, a few lost tomatoes (2 to be exact...) and some cheap plastic-tasting lettuce. you could tell that the chef here basically threw some cheap products together on a plate. the chocolate fondant was completely overcooked, i guess they do not know that the centre is supposed to be runny? on top of that its served with some overripe strawberries, and that will cost you €7 a piece. definitely not coming back here. do not recommend."
"this place looks great and i have been here several times in the last couple of years. awesome view of the sea, comfy places to sit, tasty foo "
we had to wait a lot to be attended.   kitchen closed 20 minutes after the time set on the menu. we could only ask for snacks.
"unfortunately, we were very unhappy with the bad meals. best was the bre "
"had lunch at the place before heading for the beach . limited variety of food but excellent salads , coffee and drinks . the service is slow and poor . they take time to clear the tables , probably its due to the crowd . there is a lot of scope for improvement . it could have been better ."
"ok, so the interior is quite nice and cozy in a rugged way, some kind of starbucks meets pirates of the carribean exotic coffee bar design. you can watch the beach. and thats about i "
staff here dont seem to cope well when its busy. they look like they are running around like headless chickens. ordered a beer.. 45 mins later still not arrived
"terrible service. after waiting for 30 minutes, i finally got someone and asked for a menu. in 20 minutes that still was not brought over. so went to get it myself. then again even though i asked several waitresses to order, they just kept saying that they will send someone over which they didnt so again after 30 minutes went inside to order at the bar. there were several mix ups with the orders a few times, not to mention how long it took them to bring out the food. probably could walk out without paying as no one was interested to bring the check either, had to go inside for that as well. in the end i think they mis-calculated and overcharged, but they never gave the receipt and i was ready just to get out of there. i can understand a place being busy, but there the staff was even quite rude."
"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is oké except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"baguette with salmon, there are better and tastier; overpriced. cup of coffee, only brown coloured hot water.  cognition: rip-off."
"the cheese roll, yoghurt and apple pie were good to eat but the young person serving me had more interest in her friend than trying to serve me. i appeared to be a problem asking for english breakfast tea and hadnt been replenished on the serving table. she may be identified as 603408 eden "
avoid this place at all costs.  paid in pounds and was given less euros. a bill for 15cent euro ended up paying 3 euros.  the manager couldnt help but got very furious when i showed them their reviews
avoid this place as i was double charged for my food! i was in a hurry and tapped my credit card and when i got back to the states - a sandwich and banana should of cost me $12 ended up getting charged twice and see 2 charges of $12. evidenced in my credit card statement. 
"we got a couple of beers and sandwiches which were heated quickly, but there were many disgruntled customers waiting for burgers and other food for at least half an hour and even one guy just waiting for a beer. several employees, most just standing around. appeared to be very poorly and inefficiently managed, service was a little snipp "
"waited over 20mins for my food to arrive. i went up and asked how long, a very rude member of staff told me just to wait. then he tried to serve me food that had been sat there for 10mins, which i refused. i had ordered fish and chips. it looked nothing like it!!!! then suddenly another appeared after i refused the first one. i was not confident that that was made fresh so again refused this one. the extremely rude server made a comment, in dutch, so couldn’t understand it. so i got a refun "
"€7.10 for a can of beer (a “bottle deposit” of €0.15 charged, even though it was a can) and €8.45 for a ham sandwich. ridiculous prices."
"i expect an airport restaurant to be ridiculously overpriced. this place didnt disappoint in that regard: 16 euros for a burger and over 4 euros for a coke. however, theres no excuse for bad service and an equally bad response. before i ordered, i talked to the guy who was doing the cooking. i wanted an absolutely plain burger. no condiments. no seasoning. just the plain meat. we talked for a full minute and he assured me he would make a plain burger for me. i waited about 15 minutes and then the burger was ready. when i walked up to the counter, i immediately saw that the burger was not plain. it had lettuce, tomato and mayo on it. the cook yelled over that it was plain but then came over and saw for himself that it was not. instead of offering to prepare a new plate, he started scraping the condiments off and put the patty on a new roll. hard to do this with mayo on the patty! they have their ketchup in small plastic containers. i asked the woman behind the counter for an extra container so i could kill any leftover taste of the mayo and she refused, saying we charge extra for those! she had zero customer handling skills, especially in light of their mistake. i see from other reviewers that poor customer service seems to be a recurring theme here. i dont expect that the restaurant will improve because of my review nor do i expect others to avoid this place because of it. but bad service should be called out."
"10 years living in the netherlands and this airport (inside) is still a overpriced, rodent invested, lacking in customer service, mismanged, false advertised and uncompetive peice of crud. hms host and their staff and the worst i think not a single one lnows haccp, the food choices are bread or bread. plus the staff are treated like dirt hence the reason nobody wants to work here."
"poor cappucino, is was too hot and bad taste. one of the  table or bar was uncleaned. there was empy dish. service was slow."
"like most airports drinks are relatively expensive, likewise snack food. area can be quite busy and as some people in a rush very little attention to social distancing.  apple pie is quite nice and tasty."
ordered burger with coke tom 30 minutes before the burger was finished  fries were ok but the burger was red inside complaining did not work they said that was there way to do it never again there
their staff was not giving any attention to customers. unpolitisch and rough. questions were not answered properly. the tables were inaccessible and no allowance to rest! notably in a restaurant.
"drinks in harvest market 654 look overpriced. 4.95 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. the seats next to us were not cleaned with dirts all over the place. the cashier was grumpy. what a place, but seemingly the last one at the end of the terminal."
"we went to hms host schiphol airport during departure from amsterdam in the last trip before quarantine, just few days before it start "
"after arriving at 07:30 on a flight from prague into the schiphol airport, we were starving for breakfast. the hms host schiphol restaurant looked inviting. we ordered a 3 egg omelet and 3 fried eggs, both came with a side of bacon. my partner ordered a diet coke as well. average typical airport food quality and service. total cost for two: €22.75."
"well, we never come here with big expectations and so we dont get disappointed. average quality with sometimes slow service. but at least expensive. :)"
i had a great coffee and opted for a beef burger as i was really hungry. i was glad i did not order the scrambled eggs as other customers had because they looked overcooked and unappealing. i thought 16 euro for a burger and coffee was quite expensive but i looked around and there was not much else available.
"due to an unexpected layover we needed to get some lunch. we chose hms host because it seemed rather busy and was on our way. we learned it was not the greatest choice. neither the food nor the service were very good. however, sometimes necessity out weighs selectivity. i must say there was plenty and we were ready to move forward."
"while waiting for a connecting flight we dropped in past this cafe for a quick snack,  and  the coffee and apple cake was very tasty."
"i stopped here before getting on my flight. i got the americano coffee and yogurt with some mango bits mixed in. the yogurt tasted very fresh and healthy. coffee was strong, but i left it in the bathroom and by the time i realized that and came back, the bathroom attendant had already disposed of it. oh well!"
ordered a vegan cup just 4.50 but charged me a salad cost 7. 
"in transit at schipol airport and desperate for a hot drink, we came to hms host and ordered two hot chocolates. they were small, no more than room temperature and cost 7.30 euros. a complete waste of money. avoid."
for airport bar this was not exceptional but functional and service was quick and good drinks were of good quality and price not overly expensive
"only ate here because it was close to my departure gate. i wouldn’t have chosen it if there had been other options. the fish sandwich wasn’t very good, and the bacon and egg crepe was passable. helpful and friendly cashiers, though."
"naturally fast food was extremely slow and the staff was incompetent. the food we got served was cold. when we took a tray he said we took the wrong tray, meaning he wanted to put the receipt on our tray instead of a new tray he could just have grabbed. when watching customers we’re served coffee in to go cups but there were no kids that fit the larger cups. all in all...not great"
i did not realize that this was a starbucks when i first went but the service was good and the coffee was too.
"ordered gourmet extra cheese burger and cappuccino. run by kids, not very clean, initially they gave my burger away, then put a sheet of cheese on the other guyys burger and gave me his. coffee was half full, salad turning and coleslaw looked and tasted half dead. apart from that it was what i expected from airport food. gives street food a bad name."
"crazy prices! not so much choice in the mornings and people working there not friendly at all, so tired not even see you standing in front of them."
"used a kebab place in the airport... well where do we start... we wanted burger, they had no burgers, wanted a chicken burger.. none of them either. "
avoid this spot if you are having lun 
"was ok for the momento, just eat and  "
the cost of 2 very pricey lattes was 6.80 euros almost 10 canadian dollars served in paper cups and to top it all off they didnt have any lids.
"we ate lunch for satay chicken 20,25 € and burger 20,75 €. awfull mess. never again. quality - price is poor."
"after standing in front of the restaurant waiting to get seated an employee told me to just pick a seat...in doing so another employee comes and says that i need to queue up for being seated. after telling him, that this was exactly what i did, he insisted to get me back to the start of the line. asking for his supervisor i needed to wait for quite some time and then explaining the manager what happened she was very unprofessional and noch customer oriented, telling me that she hears two different stories (from her employee and me) and does not want to find out what really happened. neither she or the employee who sent me back to the row expressed any sorry for the inconveniences....and this even although there were other people that had seen the whole story. i finally got a seat and some food (which was ok but not at all really good or even outstanding) but now at 20:00 they stopped serving food (as i wanted tom order a dessert) although the restaurant does not close before 21: "
i really like food and wine here but it is not the first time people who work there don’t know what customer service is! for place like schipol with such prices you have to invest in training for people who work for you so they know how to treat clients! especially if they dont speak dutch!!! very very dissappointing!!!!
ordered the bratwurst and fries and a lipton lemon drink.  the bratwurst was good enough to fill me up and keep going. choice of sauces at your disposal.  nothing too exciting but ok for a quick bite of cooked or cold meals.
"please doublecheck the products before buying. fresh juice in their minds is a pre-produced concentrated crap thay they sell for 5.90 a glass.  do not visit, go to another place, there are plenty on schiphol."
"i visited the hmshost heineken bar 152 at the top of the d gates whilst returning from marseille to bristol via amsterdam last week. i had time for a quick beer on the way from c gates to d gates and noticed the familiar green of a heineken bar. when it is a bar dedicated to a particular beer, you expect the best because there is no choice, only heineken. ok, so its not my favourite beer and , in my opinion, it ranks at the lower end of the scale against such beers as moretti, estrella damm, kirin ichiban and six point, however i do not object to a nice pint of heineken when time is short and it is the only bar in sight. it was not busy and i sat at the bar where two young girls were working. as soon as i sat down, one disappeared and the other began stacking glasses making sure that i had noticed her intentional ignorance. she made it clear that she had issued a challenge and, as i was short of time, i took up her challenge and said excuse me, can i have a pint of heineken please?. she looked around with an expression of disgust and replied when i have finished this. after a short time, she pulled a pint of heineken and requested five and a half euros. i paid the extortionate rate and took a gulp of the beer which was totally without gas. it was cold, granted, and it tasted like heineken, but it was flat. i called her back and explained that the beer was unsatisfactory. at this point, she said that she would provide a replacement. she pulled another beer and looked upon it noting that this one was lacking in fizz also. a male member of staff was now in attendance and he also pulled a half of the beer and gazed wistfully into the glass. they both then took the beer (her with the new pint and him with the half pint) into the back office to show yet another member of staff. i could see into this office from the bar and i observed many examinations of the glasses and much discussion therein. after around five minutes, i caught the eye of the male member of staff who had yet to venture from the back office and tapped my watch indicating that i needed a resolution to the matter before my flight departed. i was ignored and the original girl who had vacated the bar upon my initial arrival now re-appeared behind the bar. i said to her just give me a refund and i will be on my way to which she replied we cannot give a refund. i indicated to her that the beer was undrinkable. at this point i was starting to get a little agitated and within ten seconds, the male member of staff who had pulled a half of the beer to examine appeared from the back office, opened the till and gave me five and a half euros and apologised profusely about the matter. i was on my way again and i purchased a can of heineken at the shop at the gate (admittedly at the ridiculous price of five and a half euros). we all know that airport prices are a rip off but please, if youre going to rip us off, at least make sure that the product is fit for consumption!!!!!"
"this place is nothing really special, but it sure comes in handy when you need a quick bite to eat while waiting in schipol airport for your plane to depart. my wife had a yoghurt parfait type of thing, i had a caprese sandwich, and we each had sparking water. the food was just okay, the prices were slightly high (but that is expected in an airport), and the service was fast."
we had quick lunch before our flight back to ho 
this has got to be the slowest burger king i have ever visited. fifth person in the queue and waited 20 minutes to be served to get a microwaved childrens cheeseburger.
my wife and i wished to have something different rather than the usual fast food offering in airports so chose kebaya as it looked nice and the menu on the board was very appealing. the drinks were a bit pricey but its an airport restaurant! we ordered our meal using a state of the art  tablet device so thought we were at somewhere speci 
"visited their starbucks kiosk c - pier and it was efficient, good and costly but a very typical starbucks.  if youre looking for something to hold you over before a flight this works fine."
"terrible, expensive junk food. two hotdogs, one petite diet coke, 21.65 euros. rude waitress. yuck. we were in a hurry due to closely timed connections, but this experience in the airport was beyond awful. cold hotdogs. stale buns. rude service. next time, if were rushed, well skip eating anything here!"
+ smoking room next to cafe. - cold hotdogs for 8.95 eur but its ok to killing time. heineken draft beer - 5.55 eur
worst service i have ever experienced the waitress was so rude. as we had not finished our bottle of wine we asked for a cork so we could take it with us. the waitress responded with i’m busy ask at the bar. we asked her again as didn’t know where the bar was and was in a rush for our flight with this the same waitress told us we were rude and started to argue with us. i will never set foot in here ever again 
we arrive 10 minutes before they close and we saw 4 burgers available but they hid them to eat themselves..the workers prefer steal the products than sell burgers for 7€. 0% natural place
we were waiting for a noon flight but had not had breakfast. we wanted to sit down so there was a counter to do s 
enjoyed a decent cup of coffee while waiting for my flight to glasgow but should have refrained from ordering a warm sausage roll which was large and rather stodgy.  7:40 euros was expensive for very average food.
"well, its not really a special restaurant. they have enough choice from sandwiches to warm food. snacks, salads, soup etc. we got 2 cheese rolls, a small bowl salade, fries and a bowl soup and..... it cost us € 29,95. its expensive."
"thank you travel gods for airport cafés having real cups! the coffee tastes better and there is less waste. there must be a fb group dedicated to helping fellow travellers steal clear of styrofoam, paper cups with paper taste and pesky plastic lids!"
i has the looks of a fine asian restaurant at the airport but the food sadly is so insipid and tasteless and you pay a high price. i had miso ramen which was the worst i have ever had!
great location for a pre flight snack drink. clean tidy fast but be prepared for hefty charges as in the whole airport.
"the food is nice, but the prices are way to high. especially compared with the portions you get. there are better options."
"we ate here while waiting for our delayed plane. the lasagne was just fine, the pizza was ok, the beer was as it should be and the smoothie was ok as was the coffee."
"expensive, but tasty salmon sandwich ... in line with most airport prices. good location though, right in the middle of the terminal and large seating area. the view outside is also quite nice."
large assortiment in food and beverages   warm or cold. nice coffee.  good place to grab a snack just before your flight.  expansie but in line with other airports.  great view and terrace.
vast choices of restaurants at schiphol and we thought we would try the japanese restaura 
"good place to stop for a drink or snack, with views of planes and part of the runway, while you wait for your flight. not too expensive."
"everyone knows that eating outlets in airports are not cheap as they have a captive market, but given all the delicious food we had encountered on our trip, we at least expected reasoanble quality. there are a number of places to choose to eat and we would definitely not eat here again or recommend it when next passing through. the choice was very limited for drinks and food. my daughter and i ended up having very soggy and uninspiring, tepid pizza margharita with a beer, a diet coke and a chocolate milk. total cost 26 euros. my husband had an adequate burger from the counter next to this which was also overpriced. choose somewhere else to eat at the airport. it is a huge place and there are other choices."
"the coffee was good, but the ham and cheese sandwich was skimpy a banana and chocolate pastry was filling but not  wonderful"
stopped by to grab a quick bite before a trip. i had a sausage roll and a cheese roll. the cheese roll was quite good and much better than the sausage roll. the staff had a lot of customers going crazy and they handled our orders perfectly. excellent service. thank you!
i try to eat plenty of sashimi and sushi when travelling due to it being a healthy option. this airport location had a good choice and to be fair the food was good and fresh. service was good and you order you own dishes off a tablet menu with pictures of each dish which is a good way to see what you are getting. you can make worse choices in an airport. would return.
went to two of the hmshost opperated takeaway places. a breadstall and a grab&f 
place to stop by to have a sandwich and a drink before or after you take a flight or the train. ample sitting space. reasonable price.
"busy place with typical fast food you can find at the airport. nothing was too exquisite. sandwiches were, actually, awful, either empty or filled with chewy mea "
stopped in to get something to eat on the plane. options were limited but i got a bagel with cream cheese. probably got the wrong thing - was the worst bagel ive ever had.
nice place a bit hidden in the schiphol airport people are nice the food is good i got the two steaks forgot the name the one at 23€ it was too cooked for my taste the fully loaded burger is really big and good
"we blinked when we stopped here for a light lunch before our flight to the uk because we honestly thought wed been magically transported back to the wilds of north america where cardboard, tasteless take out food is the norm for a captive audience with no other options. the pizza was cold and lifeless as was the service. do yourself a favour and bypass this establishment."
food is very mediocre but they get away with it due to the captive audien 
had a piece of meat that was  cooked ok but the portion was not really so pleanty. the cost is not comparable to the quantity  probably  because its an airport.  it should be a bit more cost effettive.   the personel is friendly and quick.
once you have ordered food you might as well take the flight and come back at your leisure to collect your order. the staff are in no hurry whatsoever and will do everything to make your experience as lazy as thier service is. go to another place as there are plenty others at the airport. 
we were waiting for a connection flight and grabbed a sandwich and beer. the beer was offered extra cold and was very refreshing.  the sandwich was average but filled a gap. suggest this was better than others which looked worse!
had a terrible meal here that was not good at all. food was not warm and the prices where high.  will grab a snickers in the kiosk next time i feel hungry here.
nothing special but good enough. staff are friendly. note this is the kitchen near the casino. had omelette. did the job
"we had a slice of pizza, bread with smoked salmon, daysoup, 2 cofefe and 1 medium diet coke. 30 euros, do i need to say mo "
expensive for a cappuccino from an automatic machine (no moka) and a watered down powder made orange juice. the muffin was ok.
"this looked a lovely place inside the airport at the harvest market. however, it was so disappointing. 5 minutes before 11am they wouldnt serve a full english breakfast (even though service was until 11). i went for a cheese and chicken panini which was all dried up. the danish pastry was also dry. poor service and sub-standard food. could have been so much better. awful food and poor service. maybe it was a bad day? but it was only 10.55 am!"
"the food or drink you get is ok for a quick bite, but you will not be given a surprised by a huge quality. i have had better quality on other airports."
"my credit card bill shows hms host as charging for our meal, but reading the other reviews some clearly refer to landside outlets, other to airside outlets. this review covers the dutch kitchen, airside in the non-schengen part of the schiphol airport (so i think between piers e and f, near where the old rijksmuseum outlet used to b "
"this is very calm place away from the crowds--to reach it you must go up some stairs away from the rest of the airport. it is next to an outdoor area that gives you a nice view of the airport. we used it to kill some time while waiting for our flight. the service was very friendly and they have a nice variety of items ranging from cold sandwiches, paninis, lots of desserts, coffees and a wide variety of drinks including beer. the variety extends even beyond what ive listed. my chicken teriyaki sandwich was pretty good but ive had better. my wife loved what she got. prices were very reasonable by u.s. airport standards. all in all, this is a pretty nice place with, again, very friendly service."
"food is ok but the staff are slow in serving/preparing the food behind the counters, apart from the pizza section where they were speedy. there were long queues for most food counters i am sure because of the slow service. anyway, its fine for a pre-travel meal. "
"not good. a toasted panini with uncooked coronation chicken. they replaced it, but the replacement (bacon and egg) was oosing in fat. an all-round bad experience."
"right opposite the arrivals gates at terminal 3, this is a useful spot to wait for arriving friends/family. whilst waiting we had a cappuccino and a latte. both were very good and each was 3.75 e. didnt have any food but they seem to have the usual dutch snack foods."
coffee weak.  apple pie freezing cold.  moarella baguette tasteless.  insufficient staff to clear tables  what has happened to catering at airports?
"excellent food, service mixed. orders were lost in translation, but eventually we got more or less what we ordered. the staff were very pleasant but didnt confirm the order correctly. the food was fantastic, very tasty and nicely presented. we would eat here again but ensure the water understands before finishing the order."
"i have enough during the connection in the airport, and chose this café for lunch. the café looks quite presentable, and this determined my choice. for my amazement, the reality was, softly said, a little bit different. there were a few of visitors in the café but i waited a waitperson to make an order a lot of time. only accumulated tiredness and a really comfortable chair prevented me from simply getting up and leaving. the waitpersons discussed something near the bar counter, and i was obliged to come, go there and remind about my existence. the received lobster soup was slightly warm (however, the tea was really good). this café is not an eating house, and it looks different indeed when compared to the other cafés in the area. therefore, the expectations are appropriate. it remains to hope that it was like an exception in my case. sometimes, such exceptions occur. "
the staff were very slow and rude. i ended up not buying anything but still sat in their lounge.  find other places to spend your money.
worst service there has been over this weekend. oeuf cocotte overcooked and so late my cup of tea had gone cold whilst waiting
"acted as though they were doing me a favor, by seating us and allowing us to eat here.  staff never checked to see if food was good, if we had what we needed …. will avoid in the future!"
"i would love to be able to make contact with the owners. what a disgraceful place, lots of staff doing nothing and extremely rude. i had to clean the chair as it was covered in butter, floor filthy table filthy, at this rate i should have left. waited thirty minutes to order , received a tiny glass of champagne, and another fourty five mins later i received oven baked eggs that were microwaved and the waiter giving out hell to me for ordering breakfast that was clearly marked all day breakfast on the menu, disgusting food. i asked for the manager and was ignored went to the counter and a lady who was clearly not the manager told me that she was, i explained my experience and she actually grunted at me, offered no apology, and charged full price of €28, guess they get a lot of complaints and are used to  "
"coco’s should learn basic french if serving french items. hear me out, this isn’t an “only real french food is good” rant. i came to the airport very early for a transatlantic flight. surprisingly, lines were short and i had time for a coffee and a croissant at coco’s. after being directed away from an open one person seat at the bar to a long line a waiting patrons and waiting 20 mins only to be seated in the same seat i originally was told to leave, i brushed off my irritation and looked forward to the “large cafe crème” and croissant on the menu. i had to ask for the menu and the waiter was irritated that i could not order off the bat. everything that was being served to other patrons though looked goo "

i was there with 3 friends. we waited to be seated and after 5 minutes i ask a guy behind the bar “are you ope

waited 18 mins - couldn’t get anyones attention then finally i was able to ask the girl behind the bar for a glass of champagne. wanted to have lunch but they took too long. lots of visiting amongst the staff with each other - they need to get to work!
"stopped for what i was hoping would be a nice cup of hot chocolate. sat down right in front of the till. went there to order after about 10 minutes, but was told that they have table service. yeah, righ "
"we stopped off at cafe coco for what we thought would be a quick coffee. after waiting for 15 minutes to be served, i approached the bar and was promptly told to return to the table as there was a waiter who would take our ord "
"a group of four, well seasoned travelers, we first could not get the staff to clean the counter of dishes (at least 10 minutes from the previous customers). when we ordered 4 hot chocolates we were served 1 with no others in site for 5 minutes. we asked about our drinks and wanted to order food. we were ignored. after another 5 minutes we were told it was coming. after another 5 minutes we asked for a manager. we were told no one was in charge. the attitude was arrogant. this is not the service we have experienced in the past at schiphol airport. avoid if possible."
"second time in less than a month where they have let themselves down with the service, or should i say lack of  "
"this is the hardest that i have ever worked to get a coffee. the staff were rude, unhelpful and arrogant (except for the lone guy working there who should be put in charge of staff training, starting with teaching the others how to smile - it really was that poor). i still don’t understand the seating arrangements and neither did the vast majority of other customers that the staff spent the bulk of their time moving on, rather than getting on with their jobs serving. avoid like the plague."
"do not bother to waste your time and money going here. the service is the most appalling i have had in a very long time. we arrived and sat down, happy to try what looks like a lovely cafeteria in the middle of a busy airport and proceeded to be ignored by all staff. until we decided "
first and last time to this place. €10+ for a coffee and croissant and needed to wait 30 mins while “they prepare it”. really poor.
"arrived early morning after sleepless overnight flight and looking for a spirit-lifting breakfast at schiphol. cafe coco looked like the right place: attractive setting, varied and seemingly sophisticated menu, courteous personnel. unfortunately, the place is not up to its promise mainly due to the total lack of flexibility and customer attention. they have smoked fish platters on the menu and i request just a simple plate of smoked salmon with a slice of toasted bread: impossible! there is no kind of bread in this fancy place (?!?). i end up ordering a weird egg soufflé topped with two slices of smoked salmon which has all the skin and the dark parts on each slice, and has been significantly heated by the underlying hot egg stuff (which is not particularly tasty). at the end i ask for more hot water in my teapot (tea was made with real leaves and a pretty good brand, in all fairness) and they reply that for hot water i have to pay for a new tea (nearly 5 euros!) even if i use the same leaves. dutch rigidity? or just plain lack of attention to customer satisfaction? weird."
"had a morning flight and arrived at the café around 10:00 am. the place was busy. lots of empty dirty tables. since the sign said to seat yourself we did but there were no clean tables so we sat at a dirty table hoping to have it cleaned soon. we sat at a table for 2 right in front of the cashier. the waitress saw us sit down and came over within about 5 minutes and asked us what we would like to order. i quizzically looked at my husband wondering if she was going to clean the table first. she was not. i looked at her and said that we just sat down and had not looked at the menu yet. could she please clean the tables. she said nothing and picked up the dirty plates, cups and utensils. she was surely annoyed i had asked. she came back again and asked what we would like. i told her i would like it if she would wipe down the table since there was clearly someone elses leftover food scraps and water rings. she again looked very annoyed and said she would. she waited 10 more minutes to come back and wipe of the table then took our order. i ordered the baked eggs but asked for no meat or cheese which apparently is in all the baked egg dishes. she looked at me and said no meat or cheese? i said that is right and she looked astounded but left. we waited 30 minutes for 2 baked eggs with coffee and croissants. meanwhile no tables were cleaned and many people, at least 5 that i counted, went to the counter as asked to have the table cleaned and several people were tired of waiting for a server. they too had to get up and ask for help. no one ever came to see if everything was okay which it was not. our egg bake was undercooked and runny at the bottom. having to catch a flight in 20 minutes we decided to just not bother getting another one."
cafe coco was the last place open late at night when we were about to catch a flig 
"i never complain, but really feel the need to today (and signed up to trip advisor for the first time). this was truly terrible food and terrible service! €25 for an over cooked (asked for rare got well done) thumbnail size of beef and a plate of broccoli. when i complained the waiter (cynthia) just ignored the complaint, carried on with her duties and didn’t make any attempt to resolve the issue / refer it to someone more senior. never eat here !! if you’re in the airport go to burger king for a better meal and better service."
"me and a colleague sat down and ordered, breakfast and latte for me, coffee for him. been waiting for breakfast now for over 40 minutes, my colleague had to leave after 30 minutes without getting his coffee. the latte came after 10 minutes, and is passable."
"nice meal, slow service but a decent choice for a bite between flights. helps that we were there off-peak!"
"we were at schiphol waiting for a later flight and quite tired and hungry, so we chose this (lproper) restaurant, as opposed to one of the convenient cafes or self service places. the service was insanely awful, including not even bringing two of the items we ordered. the rest of the food made airline food taste marvelous -- we were served some sort of microwaved, cardboard tasting pasta with practically raw, cold vegetables on it. when i mentioned all of the problems, they removed the items we hadnt ordered from the bill, which left a still very expensive tab for absolutely rubbish food. avoid this place at all costs and either dine before you get to the airport -- or choose any other food!"
"in the past i have lunch here several times. it is not a place to be in a rush to catch the plane but to take the time and yes, service has as far as i experienced always been slow. but the food was of above average you could get at schiphol airport. last time this was unfortunately not the case. the food was horrible. no taste, no dressing in the salad, prefab? unbelievable bad and still quite expensive."
"the food is just ok, the fish which took 30 minutes to come on the table was overcook, when i asked for a side basket of break ive been ignored by the staff.  however the place is quiet with a nice view on the planes."
"a beautiful little cafe in the airport. the breakfast menu was small but i was looking forward to trying the baked eggs. it was okay, just okay. a bit flavourless and a pretty small portion. the coffee and service was good though."
"having arrived exhausted at schiphol airport to get our flight back to london heathrow, we made our way to what appeared to be a lovely quiet corner in ‘ cafe coc "
"i was very much looking forward to spending my layover time at café coco. it looked inviting and trendy. you could see food displayed like quiche, croissants, and numerous desserts , all temptin "
we both had a coffee here whilst waiting for a flight.  there was quite a queue - the coffee was fine but a bit expensive.
cafe coco inside the amsterdams airport was below expectations. the food quality and quantity was average.
"terrible service. ignored for ten minutes. a man pointed me out and they came five minutes after this, not concerned at all with customer service. pointed out the menu on the table (i hadnt seen it) - another 5-10 minutes passed and no one returned so i walked out, disgusted. menu looked great but attitude not worth paying money for."
"cafe coco gave me a pleasant half hours rest on a long stay in schipol. coffee ok, service ok, prices inflated - well it is in an airport!"
"croissant & cappuccino before flight. i sat at the bar, which had lots of dirty used plates, cups etc. even though staff saw the debris around me, it was not cleared. it took 10 mins to supply 1 croissatnt (with jam - which was more a sauce, gradually spreading across the plate} and a very small, medium cappuccino. i had to ask for a knife to spread the jam and spoon to stir the coffee. to be fair, watching other dishes being prepared, i think other dishes were better than my choice."
"this is a great spot for watching planes come and go, but at lunch yesterday my entree did not appear after a good long wait. i asked the waiter for my meal and she said it would be right up. another 10 minutes went by and still nothing. at that point we had to leave. our soup was ok but a very small glass of whiskey was a rip off at 12 euros."
ester the waitress swiped my credit card 8 times saying that system was down  when checked balance she charged 300 us dollars for a 25.14 transaction. this is horrible and no one will answer the phone there.
"i was looking forward to afternoon tea here after passing through schiphol on my way out. unfortunately i had a bad experience. the waiter directed me to sit at a table to be served and then he and two other colleagues served two other sets of people ahead of me, but who had arrived after me. on the second occasion, i indicated this to a waitress, who gestured to me to wait and actually said wai "
"good wines per glass, menu shows quality but still the dishes need to be cooked with care. all my requests were granted but i prefer to eat without need to ask."
"i had dinner at otium, the restaurant at the radisson blu. it was pretty good. i had the chicken supreme which is a chicken breast with with an asian sauce, bok choy and udon noodles. the flavor was good however the chicken had quite a bit of skin and fat and was a little rubbery. it wasnt bad, but not great eithe "
we had their 4 course m 
"i had a conference in the hotel, and i hesitated going to amsterdam. you can pay 70€ for a taxi (20 min), or take the shuttle (free, every 20 min) back to the airport and then the train (8€, 30 min), and then transport to where you need to go. not worth  "
"went to the otium restaurant when staying in the hotel recently. i was quite hungry so ordered from the main courses the chicken with potatoes and vegetables - i believe it was €24. when it came it looked like a childs portion - a small chicken brest, 1 carrot, one small piece of broccoli and 2 small potatoes. i finished it in about 5 minutes and was still hungry so ordered so ordered some bar finger food. what i had was nice but they are charging €24 for presentation so it was very poor value. i could have easily eaten double the amount, so if your hungry go elsewhere."
my husband and i had dinner here the night we stayed. for the price i really expected better quality. i had a filet or at least that is what i ordered. it was unlike any filet ive ever had. it looked like a filet but it was tough and not very tasty. the texture reminded me more of a club sirloin.
"this restaurant feels like its trying to join the big boys with terms like sous vide and smoked potato foam on the menu. we selected truffle risotto which was properly cooked but absolutely tasteless. there were tiny flecks of something brown in the dish, but it might as well have been sawdust for all the flavor it added. even the shaved parmigiano cheese and the bits of asparagus in the dish didnt manage to add any taste."
"we stopped in while staying at a nearby hotel, the park inn. i had the risotto with truffles which was cooked correctly but the broth was not boiled down properly and so it was soupy. i complained and the friendly waitress asked if i needed anything and suggested a free salad. her kindness was appreciated. with the risotto and a plate of cheese divided with my colleagues and part of a bottle of wine, i paid 31 euro."
"i stopped by for lunch while waiting for a flight. the food was very average, then again the prices arent too steep eithe "
"if you are around with some friends, you can jump by and have an evening talk even doe sometimes if full but is a pleasant restaura "
"staying at the radisson blu there isnt much option than to eat at otium, and although its not great value-wise i had a decent dinner."
"otium is unfortunately the only local dining option if youre staying at the radisson blu airport hotel. the service was slow, portions were small, the food is not very good and it is quite price "
"i came here because the radisson park inn hotel kitchen is closed on sundays, and they advised to come here, since it is hosted by the radisson blue hotel. i just wanted to have dinner, possibily without having to go bankrupt. i decided to take a quail salad: it costed about 12 €, and it was a portion so small it could have been ok for my 2 years old niece. just to give a term of comparison, for 10.50 € at the radisson park inn you can have a chicken salad, which turns out to be better both in quantity and in quali "
coffees were lukewarm and my friend’s mcflurry was literally served melted. very nice apple pie though!
"rude staff and overpriced product, always a bad combination. €2.40 for a hamburger which is €1.20 elsewhere in holland. when i questioned the price i was told its because you ate in the airport??? ridiculous."
"we dropped in for breakfast before driving back to the uk and used the interactive touch screens. we were a group of 12. the orders came through missing items - waitress said she would bring croissant to the table - it never came and it only arrived after 20 minutes when we asked where it was. three of us were given the wrong type of coffee which had to go back and be re-done. one of our mc muffins had a hair in - that went back and that friend had to wait for another. some people were waiting up to 20+ minutes for orders that were standard options on the order nothing special or unusual. staff seemed half asleep and didn’t seem to care and didn’t apologise when things were wrong. i appreciate we were a group of 12 but we knew this and were patient - also the place is huge and was empty we were virtually the only ones other than maybe 4 others, so it’s not like there was a back log of orders or lots of customers. overall poor, slow and lacking in customer care. "
"i would never recommend mcdonalds an a good restaurant, but this one has a twist. it have a clear vied of the runway and is a good place for plane spotting"
"being based at the airport this was less than a mcvalue meal, it was as if dick turpin was still alive. shockingly expensive but so are other eateries at the airport. the food was good, our party enjoyed it even though most of them only had eaten a few hours earlier."
"the menu and food is as expected for mcdonalds. however, the service is slow. on this day the automated registers were acting up and this slowed the entire process down. customers were not getting receipts and there was some frustrations being vented as the queue grew long "
"this mcdonalds is a short walk from the ibis hotels and about two miles from the airport. its modern, c!ran and offers electronic order placing and payment. the food is reasonably priced and quite nice. the french fries are a little thicker than in the us, but will please!"
"your typical mcdonalds. busy and staff are a little rude on the customer service aspect especially if youre visiting from another country. no toilets, which dont help."
how does one review a mcdonalds i wonder? well it was like most mcdonalds and had friendly staff. the special thing here is that it has a special plane spotting area outside with binoculars and all. inside they have a live overview of all planes coming and going and a screen with flight radar. a nice breakfast broodje with egg and bacon and coffee was good value. a small playground for children too.
"a bar and restaurant, all mixed together. the resatauant serves simple food and a speciality called the daghap, every monday. food for a low proce."
"we have previously had breakfast/ coffee here and, though the service was often slow, the food was good. today, however, we had no opportunity to sample the food, because we could not find someone who would serve us. when we arrived there were two customers outside and two inside who had already been served, and four tables were still littered with old cups etc. we asked twice for someone to take our order, but no one appeared. after ten minutes and still no service four other tables were occupied - and not served. meanwhile one customer outside who had asked several times for his bill (to no avail) left without paying. we registered our dis-satisfaction to someone who appeared to be in charge, who told us there were problems with their new system, though she and her colleague had been busy with arranging a pretty display and not clearing tables or serving customers. we were at least offered a cup of coffee which we declined. we shall not be returning."
"i went there with my son on a sunday midday to have some lunch. we sat down outside and looked at the menu. there were two waitresses serving the terrace of which one had sat down with some clients (her friends?) and was in a conversation with them. the other waitress took orders at some tables. she passed our table five times without even looking at us. at the sixth time i asked whether we could order something. she replied: ‘yes, but i am very busy’, and immediately went inside. again, she did not even look at us. when she came out after another two minutes, she again passed us without paying attention to us... unbelievable. at that point we got up and left. unnoticed by the two waitresses. absolutely uncalled for: what a rude, uninterested, incompetent staff! we live in the neighborhood, but will not be back."
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------

"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staff’s eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying ‘dat meen je niet!’ she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long she’d like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadn’t made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was ‘oer’ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though i’d ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that he’d promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.
food was ok  but we waited 2 hours for it. if you are not hungry you can go there otherwise i don’t recommend it
"i visited this restaurant with a colleague. i travel all over the world and always use indian restaurants as i can normally get good food as i am vegan. this restaurant had lots of options available to us. . from the start the restaurant supplied the wrong starters which we overlooked. however there main course was the most bland, un-appetising indian food i have ever eaten anywhere. the vegetables were either tinned or frozen, supplied with no sauce and so bad i like my colleague left over half our meal uneaten. even when i complained to what i presumed to be either the owner or manager i was met with a blank stare and she walked away. no effort was made to correct things or at least find out more. in fact all the staff then suddenly found something else to do rather than visit our table. we paid the bill in full and left. poor show for no reason. there were other in the restaurant t the same time who also complained."
"we had good experiences with other restaurants with indian style cooking. perhaps those spoiled our taste? at new delhi resto, they serve good foods but it never gives you a sense of something special - like we had before at ganga in groningen. the sitar music is not too loud still a little annoying. when paying was at hand, the personal had a lot of difficulty to find out what we had and composing the end-bill (cheque in us-english). it is not expensive at all, still we feel that this is not a place worth driving 40 minutes for, unfortunately."
nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
we came for an early diner.  the service is good and quick. the food self is good though its a small portion.
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"tasteless main dish, uninspired dessert, prices much too high compared to quality. disappointing....."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25€, and salad 9.75€. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"went there for a drink and snack, waitresses very friendly and correct! ordered nacho with guacemole, it came disappointing, hiddious! guacemole came out of a tin, processed rubbish! never seen this before. the ladies toilets stunk. definitely need a good cleanu "

"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
we had fish and chips and chicken saté. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.

terrible service. rude with no smile. didn’t allow us to order take out from the restaurant or even to see a menu.  charge money for using the restroom ‘  no vegetarian options.
"this is not fine dining but you can get a decent meal! i had a steak which was oke, the vegetables and potatoes were nice. one of the better highway restaurants that i have been in. they had a busy night, i could tell, but were still quick and friendly. "
"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajé."
"just dont go to this sh*thole  restaurant. brutal staff and very bad service. almost waited 1,5 hour for our food and after all the staff told us if you dont want you can leave!"
"we (party of three) arrived on a saturday at 6 oclock at the restaurant. we ordered wine, which quickly arrived, as did the menu booklet. after 30 minutes we managed to order water, starters and mean dishes. after 1 hour we started to ask how long it would take for the starters and water to arrive. the cook is busy with it. after one more hour: still nothing to eat. somehow the order did not arrive at the kitchen. after three hours: still nothing to eat. we also asked about the water (should be no problem, we thought). the waitress literally said : the water should be made first. then after 3 hours and 20 minutes the food arrived. mine was cold, the food of my friends was bad. afterwards, when paying, i asked the manager about what happened. computer failure, too many customers. i asked : is there anything to compensate for the bad experience. her question was: are you from here, lelystad? i said no. if you had said yes you would have got a free diner for two. i had to correct the bill. apparently the orders did arrive the billing site of this restaurant. on the bill were a bottle of wine (instead of a smaller carafe), two bottles of water for € 11 in total (which never arrived!) and one starter too many. i payed, without saying goodbye."
"nice welcome with shot of ouzo. food was delicious. cheesecake was great. staffs were nice but service was quite slow as we saw couple guests walked to staffs and complained. also, they served not-at-all cold beer (around 20c) and that really disappointed us."
"visited with couple of friends on rather rainy sunday. the interior gives very greek feeling, also the food includes some traditional dishes with greek twist. we have waited longer than i expected for the food (4 people) but it was good. however, the service was slow and not so helpful. "
the service in this resataurant is the worst i have ever seen. the staff is friendly but does not see the customer when they need something. i asked for some extra mayonese and it took them 15 minutes to get it to the table. after the starter it took the staff 30 minutes to come and get the plates. after a few minutes the french fries arrived without the main course. i would not go to this restaurant ever again. its too bad because the location is great. but enough restaurants there.
"we had arabic souvlaki,,, they food was not very prepared,, was very expensive food,, and they didnt give us a lot food.."
"food was very good. service was pretty good. they let themselves down by requiring cash , no visa accepted. this is unacceptable when trying to attract a captive international clientele in batavia haven - its not as if we could go anywhere else other than batavia haven ....... disappointing."
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"the food was extremly spicy, uneatable, most of the dishes were uncooked and the meat had a very big hair in it. the staff was also rude and handled the situation poorly, was the worst experience i ever had in a restaurant."
"good smiling and swift service cannot hide the fact the cook/chef has but a cursory idea about korean cuisine. the kimchi was just vinagered to death, the bulgogi made in the kitchen (not on your table) was a mess of lukewarm beef with salted brine sau "
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but don’t order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. “i’ll tell the chef” was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
we came here for dinner....after a 50min wait our food came out overcooked and unable to eat for 30min due to extremely oven warn....when informing the waitress she got very offensive and rude...feedback is the breakfast for champions...listen to costumers and act accordingly..it may be useful for your busin 
"food was overheated by keeping most plates 30min in an oven after cooking, till final plate was ready. only final plate was worth eating, the rest was not worth putting into your mouth. feedback from waitress...if it’s not black it’s fine...so gave up on this place. everyone can have an off day when it’s busy, but then you need to stand up or correct your issues, not refuse to listen."
"we had dinner here, it was okay,not great. had the nachos as a starter,missed sour cream and guacamole with it. ordered the burrito with beef,beef was nice,it was a little dry,just missed something. margaritas were nice. restaurant needs some real latin flavors."
"to persons, dinner on a wednesda "
"a good restaurant in the middle of leeuwarden. we went as a group of five. the service was good and the food was filling. quite large dishes. its not fine cuisine. however, it is mexican. i would return when next i visit that part of the netherlands."
"the final verdict after spending a family evening with 8 persons at yucatan in leeuwarden is that it was just average on every level, welcome, service, food and temperature. the place was pretty much packed on a nice saturday evening and apparantly has no air-conditioning. we decided to skip deserts and coffees because the restaurant was simply cooking. in my goodbye i apologised for not staying longer and said it was too hot for us all, the answer was: enjoy te rest of your evening. food was average and is served on piping hot plates which does no favour to the (fresh) salad in the middle of the dish. ever had lukewarm salad? not very nice. the food only pretends to be mexican and is bland and boring in taste. years back this place was a french bistro, i believe they should go back to that atmosphere and kitchen."
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of récola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"the menu looks promising, the descriptions enticing, but unfortunately... the meatballs were re-heated in the microwave and some were boiling hot, others were cold and disintegrating. not an experience we would care to repeat."
"went there on a saturday afternoon because of mandatory closing time at 17.00.  food was ok, but service was difficult. gave us the wrong wine (white instead of a red). starters were better than than dinner. portions too big and overall not value for money."
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
"yes, you can order a lot of tapas here. and yes, some them are great (e.g., spare ribs!). but the pace is soooo slow. we got our first order at the end of the evening. the all-you-can-eat means literally you can eat all you want, but its all about the drinks. even the drinks were not served very quickly. all in all a disappointing experience. but hey: try it for yourselves!"
"this restaurant is located in the centre of leeuwarden, so has a nice view if you sit outside. i would recommend sitting outside, because inside is cramped, dark and extremely warm. the food was ok, there was quite a lot of variety, but the quality really varied per dish. sometimes the dishes came really quickly, and some took half an hour! this makes it hard to predict exactly how much time you will spend at the restaurant. the staff was friendly and the concept of all you can eat tapas is a good one, so all in all an ok restaurant."
"the food was okay, lots of variety but not very good taste. you pay way too much for what you get. was kind of dissapointed.."
"i just had the worst pizza ever. in a place that was recommended as serving the best pizza in town. perhaps they have good ones but the frutti di mare i tried had the worst bottom i have ever had. so soggy it was as if there was pasta carrying the filling. that filling consisted of mussels, shrimps, tuna and perhaps other things. too much too salty. deeply disappointing. be cautioned."
"not sure what we missed, nice people and a very cosy restaurant. pizzas not too bad, definitely not that great, pasta was too dry, sauce too thick, way too much pasta. the rest of the family ate their dishes but i just couldn’t eat much of my marinara pasta, sauce too thick & dry, tiny shrimps, tuna all mushed up in the sauce, like a mashed up lasagna. mine was really bad."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"the atmosphere is welcoming, calming, quiet, like stepping back in time. the waitstaff were pleasant and prompt. the beer was ice cold. ordered several dishes including babi pangang, foe yong hai, and loempia. servings are ample, enough to share. some meals may have been prepared earlier as there was a distinct lack of fresh spices and herbs in the dishes. leeuwarden has several grocery stores that offer a wide range of imported spices and herbs. one of the stores, toko anphuc, is less than 5 minutes walk away from the restaurant and offers an extensive selection of fresh herbs and spices that would be a quick way for the kitchen to elevate the meal(s). based on reviews of others i really wanted to give the restaurant a 5 star rating but now reluctantly settle for 3."
"i can honestly say this was the worst meal we have had in a very long time. the starters were vile, tasteless and rubbery, and no one could bring themselves to admit how horrible they truly were. once the main courses arrived we tasted and they did not make it to our plates. normally i will not accept bad food, on this occasion i did not know where to start. we paid for our meal and left it all on table, without being questioned by the staff for our quick exit. hugely disappointed and will not be returning due to the stomach turning food. "
we have been here for three times now since 2020. the food is absolutely delicious (5 stars) but unfortunately the waiting times reduce the experience to 2 stars every time. waiting for over 1 hour and 15 minutes for our diner every time…
"nan was nog as nice as others buy the good was good. vindaloo was the hottest ever, to much. sag alloo was nicely spiced."
food choice was not too bad but service was a bit hit and miss. its great that they obviously employ local students as the waitresses but a bit more training would help. i had to open the wine as the waitress who served us had not used a corkscrew before. they also had a limited knowledge of the food being served but everything was done with a smile which helped. food was okay but not truly authentic. obviously popular with locals as it was busy for an early midweek evening. nice atmosphere but no real outstanding dishes. not too disappointed and i am sure some of the specials ( mainly meat options) would be fine for most non-vegetarians. overall experience was okay.
"we tried out jamuna tonight and were really disappointed. the food was tasteless and boring. the lamb biriyani turned out to be pulao and the spinach lamb curry can easily be given a miss. i know the standards of food drop considerably when one is away from home(india/uk), however jamuna was an embarrassment. the one aspect where jamuna scores really high is the service. very well trained, friendly staff. its a shame as we have recently moved to leeuwarden and expected this place to be our regular stop."
"hi, this week we had dinner after work. it was 3 people and two of us got intoxicated. we reported the situation to the restaurant. regards"
we excitingly made a reservation for an anniversary dinner at 19.00 (email confirmation from restaurant). when we arrived we were received by closed and locked doors. we tried calling the restaurant but no one picked up. on their website it said that they were ope 
"on the plusside the cafe has a great location on the canal. but when we went there it took 45 minutes to get drinks and 2 hours to get something to eat. and they basically just serve sandwiches and other light meals. maybe they had a bad day, but i wouldnt choose this place if i didnt have alot of time to spend waiting..."
"because i hadn’t seen my friend for a while, we decided to go for a high tea and catch u "
"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
food is not real indonesian. it has a dutch twist. not prepared with fresh ha good indonesian meal. so not a  second time for me
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
still good coffee and good sandwiches. the place is absolutely clean and lovely decorated. i definitely recommend it if you want to enjoy a nice coffee thats not filter coffee ...

"review: looking fine at the frond-view, the interior and restaurant setting is a bit basic and easy-done. staff is friendly but not always very attentive. food is taste and divers if you order one of the menu/arrangements. the different sorts & tasts of dishes are served on a warmer. product-quality is rather average. housewines are  "

"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
"on arriving for a single seat i wasn’t offered a choice but rather bluntly told to sit inside on a lovely evening. perhaps i should have been more vocal. i ordered an alcoholic drink and asked for some tap water. i was told they “don’t have tap water” only bottled water at 3euros. at this point i explained i needed water to eat food with and was told i could get one glass. the food was fine, and i could see native dutch speakers getting warmer service than me. i did get complementary popadoms, however i would have appreciated more water. anyway the tip they did not received would have been a lot more than three euros. another local eatery nearby was happy to give me a pint of water free. why did i get upset over water? i think it was the manner - when you go out to eat it’s about the whole experience, which doesn’t encourage me to go back when i’m there in business again."
if you are looking for a good dining experience in apeldoorn its time to look elsewhere 
"not too much to say.....the service was friendly....but the food was not very hot and very bland, hardly any flavours in any of the 4 dishes we ordered. wont be returning."
the manager has an aggressive and impatient attitude which i took exception too. i queried why there were no onions with the starters and he reminded me i was in the netherlands and not england. i decided to leave and he called me an idiot. i’m proud to say i didn’t knock his head off but needless to say i wouldn’t recommend this restaurant.
"while staying in hoenderloo on the hoge veluwe national park we decided to try the indian cuisine in nearby apeldoorn. the restaurant did not live up to expectations though, that were highly strung because of the website promising authentic indian cuisine. the restaurant was not very clean and in fact smelled rather strongly, and alas not of indian food but probably of old baking fat. the personnel was friendly but rather clumsy, bringing the wrong wine. the food was not very tasty, as we are used to from earlier experience with really good indians - like swaat in kampen or mayur kitchen and gandhi in zwolle. prices were average. all in all a dissappointing experience, maybe the more because they presented themselves on the internet as really good. "
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
get your sh*t together b 
"together with some friends we tried this place, well thats once. food came out frozen out of the microwave, and were glad that we didnt got sick."
"this was our first repeat visit since discovering la cubanita a few years ago. unfortunately, nothing has changed for the bett "
"good restaurant, we had de 5 course menu and it was very enjoyably and for 32,50 euros, our only complaint was that we sat near the open kitchen, and we smelled everything , also meat that had been burned,"
"i was dining here with my dad, the place itself looks good, but the staff is very young and not everyone knows what theyre serving. we chose the 5 plate surprise menu of which the first an second course were amazing but the main dish very blend. we told the waiter who would discuss it further with his chef. he never got back to us. anyway its an ok place i you go without expectations. "
it is located a bit off the center of the charming city of apeldoor 
were here for the third time. the weather was beautiful and we had a with rush mats protected spot outdoors. we sat in a corner surrounded by cobwebs. the starter and main course we found formidable bad. only the coffee was good to drink.
"it is an old fashion and old representation restaurant. the ambience is not really appealing and so is the buffet. vietnam cuisine is one of my favourite because their unique taste and fresh ingredients. but you do not see and find on their buffet selection foods - it is dull. fortunately it has open kitchen for grill, pho (soup) & banh xeo (vietnam pancake). the pancake is superb, soup is oke and the grill is o "
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"after waiting 15 minutes we could finally order a bottle of champagne.   after waiting an other 15 minutes we left, without ever having seen any champagne.   worthless service."
previously i was a regular visitor of martins. last time about one year ago. today i had a lunch at martins again. to my surprise the food is much too expensive for what is being served: i had to pay 58 euro’s for two persons incl 1 glass of wine each. staff is not really friendly. room for improvement.
did the heat wave effect the staff?the hottest day inthe netherlands ever! the food was so so and the staff were pleasant but there is lack of attention to detail . the mackerel salad was not what it could have been and indeed the lettuce was covered with the dirt from its growing bed! without an apology but recognition of the “blunder” i was pleasantly surprised to see the deduction of that meal on the bill. a lot to be picked up on in our opinion.
"the place is very loud, and food is just ok. if you are ok with that, you will probably be fine. good place for a snack before going out on saturday night. this is the 4th time i have been there as i wanted to get them another chance. there was always something wrong with the food. this time their burata is/was very bad. last time rissoto was sticky, before that the cream (foam) on surf and turf was off... i like that they offer a nice selection of wine per glass, just too bad that the food is not just a notch better. still some room for improvement."
cosy and darkish bar/restaurant. not a pub. beer selection is very poor. 6 in total and bottled only.... only 3 affligem are worth the drink.... so dont go there if youre a beer fan.
got here with a voucher of vakantieveilingen. three course menu. as starter we had the fungi and carpacio both very tasty. we both enjoyed the main salmon course with fries and salat. we finished with ice and baklava. serving staff is a bit slow and the restaurant is a bit on the sober side. also the marktstraat is not the prettiest street of apeldoorn. good value for money though!
"nice place, not a huge selection on the menu but enough for a nice lunch. went there with my mother and they were willing to change her selection so she could eat it more easily as shes handicapped."
after a lovely day all around the apenheul monkey enclosure. we decided to eat lunch. we both ordered a beef burger. i cut mine in half to see red raw meat and it was stone cold. sent it back to kitchen and it came back to me again raw. don’t waste your money here. far to expensive.
"actually, this is a nice place in a nice setting on the edge of a park, overlooking a lake. more of a nice lunch venue than a dinner setting, with a pleasant terrace if the weather is fi "
"nice place for coffee or lunch, but not for dinner. great location, nice vuews, good service if not too busy."
visited after a day of apenheul. tries to be haute cuisine and comes very close. could be bigger portions for these prices.
we called to book and were told that we could reach without any problem: once we arrived the lady told us that she had received no call and that there was no availability. quite shocking to receive such rudeness after having travelled to reach the place.

"we booked a “wild” menu (5 coarses) to celebrate the season, knowing a lot of game is available on the veluwe. the result was a bit disappointing however as if the cook still was in summertime spirits. also the wine combinations were pretty average, and for one dish even horrible (wine far too sweet for the rather sour (mustard) tasting dish). all ended up in a too high price/quality ratio. we have had better experiences for even lower prices."

we were a party of 7. special occasion family dinner and selected this restaurant for its reputatio 
"fantastic meal at this establishment, but the hotel room was rather disappointing - not enough attention to detail and too dark.  lights broken, decor a bit tatty.  i would eat here again, but not stay."
"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"
"friendly staff. food was ok-ish. all you can eat for 18,5 eur per person excl. drin "
"driving along the road into town a big sign in front of the restaurant xl steak €17.95. sounds fine. checked on the menu at the entrance: again xl steak €17.95. we ordered 2 of those. nice big steaks, modest portion french fries, tiny portion sauce. no garlic butter as promised on the menu. as desert caramel coupe, described as vanilla ice cream with caramel sauce and pieces of chopped caramel. the ice cream was very soft and the caramel sauce missi "
"very average food, in an average hotel. staff friendly, but poor quality food for a four star hotel. dinner and breakfast both over-priced for quantity and quality. go just up the road to restaurant de heerlijckheyt het loo, and youll get a much better meal."
"we used to enjoy the restaurant, the food was rarely exceptional but the location and atmosphere was good. it recently reopened after what they advertised as a major refurbishment; this was our first visit since then. we were really disappointe "
"busy evening and the service was poor and slow. when we finally got the orders, they were fine, but ..."
"nice restaurant and atmosphere, the service was good. although i did not understand why the food was served by waiters wearing black gloves! i ordered a carpaccio as a main dish, the plate was brought to the table with the black gloves waiter. it was a enormous plate carpaccio (i thought), disappointing was that most of the plate was green salad with a small portion of carpaccio below. maybe next time i have to try something else!"
"the food was just excellent and the athmosphere cosy. but one of the female servants was a misplaced one. she was not a part of our (guests) dinner, but she acted as if! we were there to evenings, but no more!"
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
the taste was all over the place. everything was super sweet and not exactly like what it called. compare with the price is bit much.
"normally i love to go to this restaurant because foods are teste good. i like foods there but i don’t really like the owner. i can’t even choose where i wanna sit and once i went there with a friend he not even say hi or anything. he just said that he can’t take orders anymore because he have to make 7 take away orders. never saw this before in my life. but finally i try to not think about it. today i went there with my boyfriend. i ordered 2 noodles, 2 drink, and chikuwa. after that i only got my 2 noodles and 3 drinks ( i ordered 1 drink but i told him oh no not this one this one. i think he doesn’t understand that i changed to another drink ) i told him i didn’t ordered this one. i changed to another one. he not even said anything just walk away with his mad face. i also didn’t even have my chikuwa the one that i have ordered... really!? need to improve. if i didn’t check what i have to pay before i pay i probably have to pay more money for a drink that i haven’t ordered. i don’t know if i want to come here again or not."

before a movie i took my family to this place for lunch. the little man had a burger. he asked for a well done burger and the waitress said it might be a bit dry. so he agreed to a little bit of pink insid 
"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."
"let me first say that the food we ordered was amazing. this was a 10/10. the amount of food and the presentation were beyond our expectations. but as we were sitting next to the bar/kitchen, we were able to see our food being prepared and hear the employees talki "

the food menu is extensive but the actual taste is pretty average. i missed the punch of a good mexican dinner. all the sauces tasted as if they came from a jar and not freshly made. they served normal cream and not sour cream which was a surprise. service was good and prompt. all in all efficient but not the most gourmet evening.
"used to be an agreable venue, uncomplicated, friendly priced. januari 2019 renovaties started, nothing announced regarding the plans/concepts for the future."
"the service was really good , the lady behing the bar very nice . i cant complement enough. just walked in off the street with a friend . the food was extremely basic . so easy to cook but the presentation, well there is none . poorly made , poorly plated. i personally wont be back even if its free. sorry for the honest review . feel bad but you need to seriously up your game"
"we were here in august 2015. i had hamburger with fries and my bf had chili con carne. chili con carne tasted pretty good but my hamburger wasnt anything special. we also had to wait a long time to first get a table, get the food and to pay for the food. because of pretty bad service and food nothing special i would not come back here if i visit arnhem again."
i know this restaurant for years but hadnt been there is some time. i was disappointed with the food. the service and ambiance were fine but the food let it down. sauces didnt taste like they were made with fresh ingredients such as sour cream which is a must for a mexican restaurant. my main course of chicken on a skewer was wrapped in a tortilla with a very sour sauce. the guacamole was also very sour. pity..... i left very disappointed. the fresh mint tea and corona beer were the highlight of this meal. such a pity for what was a good restaurant. 
"the restaurant was almost empty when we got there, so we went to some table where we wanted to sit, but we still got invited to the bar so that the waiters prepare the tables. they did this with a few more people and the bar was really small and we where basically waiting on the corridor. i dont think they did anything else, but brought some forks and knifes and we had to wait for about 5 minutes for that. anyway, we got to the table and we ordered a beef enchillada and a small size ribs portion with baked potato, two glasses of wine and water. they brought the wine, and i thought that they will also bring the water right away. it didnt happen and after 10 more minutes i asked again for the water, and after ten more minutes we also got some water. then, instead of beef we got chicken enchillada, and instead of small portion of spare ribs with baked potato, we got medium portion of spare ribs with fries. i havent ate spare ribs there before and i didnt knew what the sized mean, but i also felt that what i have in the plate is quite big for a small portion, so i asked if what i got is a small portion and not maybe a large one. the guy that got the food confirmed that it was a small portion. we ate, and when we finished we asked for the check. after about 10 minutes we asked again for the check and after about 15 more minutes we finally get the check where i found out that apparently i ate a medium portion of ribs and not a small one as i ordered. even so, we had to pay what we ate, and not what we ordered. i told the waitress all my complains and also about the waiting for the check and she started saying how there are some waiters that are sick and they are understaffed and these kind of excuses. actually, i also think they were understaffed, but i really dont see how thats my problem and not the restaurants manager probl "
"mexican food in europe has become a bit of a joke and this restaurant takes it to a point where it is no longer funny. amazing how many names you make out of the same three ingredients. but whether it was a burritto, a chimichanga, an enchillada, a taco, a fajita or a lump of indiscernible gloop, it was all pretty much the same. most tuna-like chicken ive ever encountered. maybe we should contact the wwf about a new species (although some of the other things on the plate were clearly of alien origin)."
mexican is probably my favourite food. i make it at home and there are some amazing restaurants where i am fr 
"well been here, and for mexican, i have had much better. the staff were intentive. but then when there were so few in the place _ this should have been a warning."
i have been twice in this restaurant and twice i was amazed by the lack of mexican dishes in this so-called mexican restaurant. sure spanish names may help you think you are eating mexican food but take a closer look and you will realize this is really average dutch dinner with disgusting canned guacamole and ingredients that i am not even sure you can find in mexi 
"we wanted to have dinner here, but when we entered the restaurant they immediately almost literally pushed us out of the building because we brought a stroller with us for our 2 year old daughter. in an extremely rude manner we where told that strollers arent welcome in the restaurant?! not really a family-restaurant, as they pretend to be..."
"a friend of mine and me bumped into this delicious mexican restaurant after have been looking for a suitable one for hours. the interior design of the restaunrant is unforgettable, full of decoration, some real stone walls and a chimeney. we ordered two unalcoholic drinks followed by two burritos. the drinks were not so big but delicious, while burritos were massive! we actually did not finished them. more burritos were brought with rice, beans and salad. the bill is not one of the cheapest (42€), taking into consideration we took just one plate and one drink per person. but it is worth going there! ill go back for sure."
i waited for almost a hour and half. then when i got my delivery the forgot my ice tea. so i tried to call the restaurant because that was the advise from the delivery person. well the restaurant didnt pickup the the telephone three times. never eat there ever again!
"had dinner here with colleagues, being brits we generally know our way around indian food. standard offerings starters were ok our main courses lacked a bit of flavour and spice though. fairly priced, a little cramped at the table though. service ok."
will not come over again as the food was rather plain and the cloth on the table used and stained. doesnt worth of bothering
food was okay.... but... service is very poor....customers literally waving to get attention. needs fixing!  train the staff....
food was ok but when you don’t like chicken it’s a problem. the lamb was way too spicy even for someone who likes spicy. the veggies were ok and the salad was finished and not filled again too bad. little disappointed.
"i went into this restaurant when they were serving buffet. i was eating alone as away on business. service was friendly enough. unfortunately, i was disappointed by the food; there wasnt a great selection and the taste was just ok. perhaps the a la carte dishes were better but im not going to return."
"we chose the buffet menu. a modest choice of chicken and vegetable dishes. one lamb dish, no fish or other meat. mild, medium or spic "
after dinner drinks and coffee with the four of us. staff is full of pretence and annoyingly fake-jovi 
"nice place, very nice terrace, nice fingerfood, nice beer, but the wine is terrible. we tried the pinot grigio, the verdicchio and the sauvignon blanc and they all tasted like acid. this is the worst quality wine you buy in the supermarket and is a bloody shame that they sell this wine. so, if you go, drink a coke or a beer, but forget the wine!"
"food was average but served hot and quickly. the staff were very attentive and enthusiastic. no wines by the bottle available. restaurant was not as clean as it could be, same in the washrooms. we would not go back."
we have eaten here before. as usual the good was quite good but 
terrible pad thai ever not even close to pad thai is look like bakmie goreng but tasteless!! such a waste of money and time to go there.
"i went for take out and when i got home i discovered the worse uneatable phad thai koeng i ever had. no greens (spring onion), no taugé, no peanut, no taste. just noodle with egg, oil and a lost slice of carro "
"a nice place to go if you like thai food. nice place, good service and average price. i recommend for a business dinner or just to have some good spicy food!"
"so they advertise with all you can eat. so from the outside it looks quite inviting. so youre hungry. walk on. because as soon as youve decided to sit down and order anything, the waiting game starts. it takes them around 30 mins to serve you another helping of the all you can eat skewers. and they are badly cooked... i mean badly. no seasoning, burnt on the outside, tiny little quantities of meat hidden between big chomps of union. after more than two hours and forking out eur 40 per person we left hungry and frustrated. never again."
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"we chose from the special 3-course-menu. choice is not exciting. however, the food is good. next time ill choose from the menu."
we had reserved a place on a saterday for java buffet at 20.00 ho 
"where to begin - i have had had food in my life, but this was from another level. we literally received our food from the microwave. we ordered and then 4 minutes later the food was on the table, even the rice was pre-heate "
tasteless and greasy dishes. hectic and disorganised service by overwhelmed students. worst rijstaffel ever…
"we had the vegetarian rijsttafel and well, yes, it was okay. average food. the veggies were definitely not freshly cut but frozen or tinned. there are many excellent indonesian restaurants in the netherlands, this one didn’t live up to our expectations."
"every time i visit the netherlands i try to eat at indonesian restaurants as they are usually good. batavia, however, was disappointing. the service was actually great and the food tasted fine, but it simply was not the kind of bursting with favour food i expect from an indonesian rijsttafel. many of the dishes tasted similar and, to be honest, ok, decent, tasty enough, but lacklustre. if back in arnhem again i would favor the thai restaurant where we had eaten the night before, where the food was bursting with flavour."
"we went for the batavia rijsttafel and were served various large portions of rice, meat and vegetables by a very friendly waiter. the way the wine was served made it clear that this was not the beverage of choice of most of the patrons. nevertheless did we spend a pleasant evening with plenty of good food."
"eat dinner here with colleagues on a business trip, large selection of set menus. food was decent and plenty of dishes, service was a little erratic but all in all ok"
ingredients are of ok quality but nothing special. the seasoning is bland. ive eaten much better indonesian food in the netherlands. the price is reasonable but given the food i would not recommend this place.
i would never eat here again the food was disgusting and we were waiting too long to be served. my partner caught a stomach bug and his lip broke out in blisters due to them serving him tap water from a bottle which was not sealed. i would recommend nobody to eat here and i have let my family and friends know not to go there.
"based on tripadvisor, had high expectations which it didnt meet. vegetable soup was quite tasty but fried snapper fish wasnt great. and was surprised the bill reached 70eu for 2 adults and 2 kids. service was good."
"the service was good and the owner really was welcoming and pleasant. having had indonesian at good places is amsterdam, utrecht,  and die hague i would say that the food was a little disappointing."
"centrally located just across the street from the railway station. rating this restaurant, is dependent of what you expect. what you will get is a good meal for a low cost, served by friendly people. if you expect a real treat - this restaurant is probably not the best choice."
"buffet setup was 2 entrees (soup and sateh) for which we had to wait 20 min each, after which we were allowed to go for the buffet. during the 90 minutes we were there, we were asked nearly ten times if we wanted to drink somethin "
we decided for this place as it was ranking 2 in arnhem. we were welcomed by friendly staff and ordered a 5 course meal for 3 people. the appetizers were not up to expectation at all. spring rolls were very tough. the main dishes were ok but noting special. doubt i will return
"on a sunday evening around 18 hr we managed to get a table in this apparently popular place. the food is ok, but not as special as the high ranking on tripadvisor suggests. next to set rice tables they offer the possibility to chose your own combination of dishes, which is a good alternative for small appetites."
it was my first time at this restaurant and the last one for sure. i have been to other indonesian restaurants before but this one was very disappointing. ive had never seen such a black chicken before and the rice was near to dark brown. they were not burned but over marinated. it was still edible but i will never recommend this restaurant.
we thought the service could be improved. more gentle and more customer is always right. we ordered lontong cap go meh and their version is pretty far from what indonesian would expect.  the nasi goreng and satay is great though.
"very nice manager; gave us a very welcome feeling. also our two children were more then welcome. this is a big plus. the service is sometimes a bit indonesian too; slightly chaotic and slow. we had a rijsttafel.....the food was ok, but not special. considering the low price, i would say that price/quality is go "
"the thing that killed it for me was the slow service. they kept us waiting for our food as they busily tidied up the restaurant at the end of the day. there was hardly anyone else there either so why the delay? a note of caution too, the stairs down to the toilets are quite steep if you have small children or you have had a few. better deals with more attentive staff elsewhere in arnhem."
"encouraged by the positive reviews, we booked here for 7.30 on the friday, and were encouraged by all outside tables being full. greeted by a staff member who in perfect english told us she was studying in the uk, and made some recommendations whilst taking drink orders, all seemed to be going well. however, it went downhill after that, mainly because of the very slow service. as recommended, we chose the batavia meal for two, with its multiple small dishes, but they took so long to come that despite the enjoyable indonesian beer, we became increasingly fed up, and the food when it did arrive wasnt that special. spring rolls and the skewers were ok, but the main dishes were not that warm, not that tasty, and rather overcooked. one of the poorer meals and experience we have had for a long time."
"we are indonesians visiting arnhem for a week and we visited batavia 3 times. so we could vouch how authentic and good their food is. despite the great food and friendly service, unfortunately we had to leave a bad review as we were completely disappointed on our last vis "
i went there together with my girlfriend for valentines day but the food was not really special. there was no wow factor.
this was my favorit restaurant in arnhem for a long time. but our last visit was more than disappointin 
"after reading the great number of laudatory reviews, i made a reservation online, but got no confirmation. we went anyway. the place was less than half full. we ordered dinner, a rijstafel...and sat waiting with the expectation of a fine meal. the waiter was extremely friendly. our drinks and chips came quickly. then we waited...and waited. finally he took our order. and we waited...and waited. forty-five(!) minutes later, our first appetizer arrived. we actually werent discouraged. the food would make up for the delay. one half-hour later, i got out of my chair to look around the restaurant. perhaps the other end of the room was crowded (no...), or there had been an accident in the kitchen (no...), or our waiter had quit his job and emigrated from the netherlands. but there he was, near the bar, carrying plates. i cornered him and inquired about our second appetizer. he actually replied by asking how long it had been since the busboy removed our previous plates. after the second appetizer, we had soup (it came promptly), and then waited for another thirty minutes for our main dishes. the yellow rice was tasty. the ten little dishes were flat and uninteresting..and a bit too salty. the fish was the worst: baked mackerel. i like mackerel. i like fishy fish. but this was beyond fishy. it tasted like it had been ripening on the doc "
no complaints other than the service being slow.  food was good.  found another indonesian restaurant in the central that was better so i would most likely not return.
"we were recommended this restaurant as a specialist indonesian one. we arrived at around 8, bearing in mind people tend to eat early in holland - the restaurant had closed by 10pm. there is an extensive offering, including at the weekend a buffet. as we had not eaten indonesian before, we decided on one of the many rijstafels, which essentially are a selection of dishes with either rice or noodles. to my taste most of the food tasted similar and unlike other asian foods was not particularly well differentiated. on discussion afterwards we wondered whether this was because we had arrived towards the end of service and were dealing with dishes that had been sitting around. total cost including a couple of glasses of wine 90 euros for three. despite good hosting, i’m not sure i’d visit again."
"i have been to this restaurant once for a dinner, expected something special since the reviews on this places are wonderful. what weve got was terrible, food was already pre-cooked, then made once again warm so my starter was over-fried. the main dish was way too sweet, not spicy at all, and cooked long before serving too. i really dont understand what made this place so popular. its nothing."
"all is in the title. if you like ribs, want to try it and are in arnhem: this is the place to go. besides service is done by very nice people in a welcoming place."
"we frequently eat out at china town in arnhem,and are generally very happy with the fo "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"we had just arrived in arnhem and were desperate for a cup of coffee. the café is counter service, and the cost of two flat white coffees was a hefty €7.5 "
mams coffee arnhem has an industrial look. i like that style. but i wasnt there for the interior. several reviews made me step into this coffee bar / lunch room. i ordered an xl mams iced coffee caramel and a piece of speculaas cheeseca 
visit “mams” on a sunday for a cup of tea and a apple pie. drink came fast but had to wait quit a bit for a pie. thought it took a while because they going to heat it up. but it was still cold. the employees seems a little chaotic and stressed. don’t know why because it wasn’t that busy. lucky the drink and food are quit ok.
"i was very curious about this new place and i had big expectations but oh surprise! after 15 minutes of sitting there and looking around no body came to take my order. the place wasnt full at all!. i was completely ignored!!!! after 10 minutes of being sitting there three other guests came in and the were immediately helped. i found that very rude , the woman running the place saw me walking in. so i left the place and went next door to the competition, they also have a nice coffee and wat lekkers. i will never return back to this place."
"the food was very delicious and tasty. as an indian food lover, food was traditional and spicy, as can be expected. the service however was very poor, slow and not service oriented staff. a smile when dealing with customers can go a long way."
"we have recently moved from hilversum to arnhem. so we thought lets try indian food in arnhem. so we went to king of india and ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka and rice. it was a take aw "
"went for dinner as a group. nice reasonably easy service. helpful staff. however food was too spicy. ordered vegetarian dishes mostly and found them having an extra yard of spice. they have only naan bread and not the roti. the naans were not cooked well and were not crisp, found it tough to digest.not coming back again!"
we have often been to indian restaurants. these visits were always nice. this restaurant was an alltime low. this for the following reaso 
"i went here after hearing people mention to me that theres also an indonesian take-away here -- i normally go to toko rinus (not in the centre but highly recommended). was disappointed. not too many choices, dry meat."
"some dishes were tasty, but not special. we did not know what to choose. information on the menu and from the staff was not very helpful."
"visited here with friends, as a non dutch speaker, there was no english menu but not an issue... google translate worked a treat. a lot of rice dishes, we opted for mixed meat dishes with various sides to share. meat was cooked well, moist and tasty. sides added to the enjoyment of the meal. service was slow. wine... one white one red. reasonable priced restauran "
"the was our third visit. we loved the previous visits very much, but this time it was pretty bad. we were not alone, but the place was not crowded either. nevertheless we had to wait 2 hours or even more for being served, the servants did not pay attention at all, the food was partly burned. we know the food can be great, but this evening everything went wrong, very frustrating because it was a special day we wanted to celebrate with a nice meal."
"good location close to nijmegen centraal station. nice atmosphere and friendly staff (although the service was a bit slow). overall, i had a fairly positive experience."
expensive for what it is. i went once for a drink with a friend and had a smoothie. for the price and the size of the smoothie i would have expected a lot more. service was also slow.
"we went there and everything took extremely long. first, the table wasnt cleared for solid ten minutes. it took another 15 minutes for my cappuccino to come and until my friends drink came, i had finished my cappuccino for a while. our food (sandwiches, nothing very complicated) took 50 minutes. as they finally arrived we at least got a sorry it took so long, haha. delicious, but terrible service."
"we had two sandwiches, both with different fillings. when served, we noticed one slice of bread had the filling and the other lay next on the plate. unfortunately there was not enough filling to spread over the second slice, and to place on t "
what poor service. over a hour before the starters arrive and that was only one out of 4. hardly anyone in the place. what is the chef doing? the lady serving also wouldn’t rush out the building if the place was on fire.
ate here a couple of times although the welcome was friendly and shown to a table straight away even without a reservation the service then slowed down substantially from bringing the menu to getting the bill. food was good including the naan breads and the portion just about right but quite expensive overall. an occasional treat but certainly not a regular one.
"the biggest disappointment was the food. nothing to say more. the service is fine, the staff is friendly."

have eaten here a number of times. was initially good but lately seemed to have a very salty basis for their food. friendly enough service but really too much salt. will not go back since there are better indian restaurants in nijmegen
" from entering this restaurant the atmosphere, service and attitude of the staff was appalling. the only reason we ordered starters, were because we were told by our hotel, that the indian food was the best in the town. we would recommend that anyone considering going to this restaurant should not? it was awful!!!!! we did not order a main course."
"very standard indian restaurant with all the classic dishes. good but no surprises, except a massive bill."
fine location. pity the food was too salty for me. hot does not only mean more chilli! used to be better! dont think ill be back. there are better indian restaurants in nijmegen.
the restaurant is tiny and the tables are pretty crammed in. theres quite a good selection of dishes both meat and vegetarian. we ordered some wine which we sent back because although it wasnt corked it wasnt nice and they didnt quibble about it. service was a bit slow because there were only 2 waiting staff and it was fairly busy.
the worst place we ever been to.. waiters were so rude.. 
the food is good. but their behaviour isnt appreciable though. i doubt whther they r indian too. i have been to other indian restrau in other countries too and they always had given us warm welcome but here it was out of questio 
"first time when we visited this restaurant, we could clearly see the difference in the way they were treating asian and local people. i doubt if they are really indian. they were doing unwanted arguments in a very ironical way as if we were obliged to be there. except the lady everyone else seem to have pathetic attitud "
"indian gate is an ok indian restaurant, but the dishes are bland, no comparison the nice spicy indian food i learned to appreciate in restaurants in london and even california."
"i fail to understand why this describes itself as an indian restaurant as the meal we had did not have any flavour , seasoning or heat normally associated with this type of food. perhaps the locals of leerdam do not like spicy food- if they did they would not be eating here. neither will we on a future visit to the area. easily the most tasteless indian food weve ever been served."
"i visited the restaurant with business colleagues and the restaurant was busy for a tuesday night.  we enjoyed the food, but the kitchen was overstretched and therefore the service slow.  main course size was generous, so unless you are hungry, maybe skip the starter."
just a chinese restaurant that you -vint down anywhere in the country. fine it is that you know exactly what is delivered food quality
ate here with a group of 12 while cycling round holla 
i cannot believe that this is the third rated in makkum. my wife and i went here for lunch and ate a simple hamburger. a simpeler dish is hardly imaginable. well this place knows how to ruin it. the worst food we had in decades. the chef should be sentenced to eating his own food.
"hotel was average, if you are looking for local restaurants and bars, better to be in town with quaint restaurants rather than large commercial hotel which caters for larger groups. hotel in need of upgrading.  breakfast was good."
"we had pre-booked a 3 course meal for a set price and on arrival were dissappointed to find that if we wanted anything more than soup/bread, a plate service and an icecream, we had to pay supplemen "
subzero is in a small shopping center near the center of amstelveen and yes there is a line here as well.  the parking is ample and the ice cream was good i tried the white chocolate and the lemoncello.
food quality was good but there’s a lot of hookah and place is stuffed with hookah smoke. i also have heard through grapevine that the owner is abusive and violent person and exploits and abuse the workers that are in vulnerable situations. it’s not worth it avoid this place
"we had a late lunch. decor, waitresses & ambience were all pleasant enough. however, we had to wait a bit too long for very simple food which was considerably overpriced : 9.95 (almost 10 euros!) for 2 small vegetarian croquettes with bread & mustard? 5.95 euros for a toasti "
there is indoor and outdoor dining depending on the weather.  the pancakes were just so so.  they do have a smaller size for the smaller appetite.

"the food and drinks are ok but by now there have been multiple instances where i, and/or the people i was accompanied by, were treated incredibly poorly. the staff has been very denigrating towards customers, giving snarky responses to normal questions or complaints, i.e. menu did not list all the ingredients used for dishes. one of the sandwiches contained mayonnaise, though this was not indicated. my acquaintance, who is allergic to eggs, ordered this and got an incredibly rude response when she complained about this to the staff. the response was overly defensive and shifted all the blame to my friend, who had carefully read the ingredients list beforehand. the tone with which this was said, too, was unacceptable. it almost seems as if the staff purposely tries to make their customers feel like they are idiots. overall, terrible experience(s)."
the selection of small plates is extensive and we always get several all the shrimp  choices are good.
"we will write our comment in english, so everyone (even foreigners and tourists) will understand. it was a terrible choice to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and another 20 year life event/celebration in this restaurant. if we had known in advance how poor the service and food was... the meat was fine (the only fine thing actually), however there were almost no vegetables on the plate, only a piece of lettuce... furthermore, the reception/service was incredibly impersonal, cold, not child-friendly at all and not polite. first of all, there is no child menu. this is the first time we visit a restaurant without children menu... moreover, the restaurant was almost empty, but all we got offered at arrival was a table by the door (?) we are a family with two little children, its winter, it is really cold outside, a table by the door for a family in an almost empty restaurant makes no sense, there were lots of empty tables far from the door! of course, we refused, and then they told us we could seat at the back. when ordered the dessert, we got first one dessert and then the other one, but much later! also, we ordered two desserts for 4 persons. normally the service would bring 4 spoons, in case you would like to share. but, this restaurant didnt have any attention to detail. it is the first time this happens to us too. the sticky rice dessert was not sticky at all, was dangerously hot and too sweet. it wasnt possible to enjoy it, it was just extemely hot and we had to blow and blow until it got less hot, like 15 minutes later. wifi was just inexistant... and when leaving the place, we werent even ready putting our jacket on when the service came to clean up the table, in an almost empty restaurant... how rude. this has actually never happened to us before either. we go out for dinner regularly. really, please dont waste your money and time with people who dont have any sensibilty for clients, or for children, or a client service mentality. we are very angry because this kind of service can really ruin ones special celebrations/nights! such a pity. of course, we will never ever go back and will make sure everybody knows how poor, rude and cold caphé saigons service is."
"i have been a regular visit to this restaurant, usually i visit the one in gelderlandplein but since new branch open in amstelveen, i start to go here. however i believe this new branch still need to improve with customer service. i felt the one in gelderlandplein is better in sense of customer service. it is pity because i love the food but i expect same quality of service whichever branch i visit "

a former farm since long time changed into a pancake restaurant. i love this place. its very relaxing especially in summer when you can sit outside. the pancakes are great as well as the drinks. many years ago it went for self-service which unfortunately was a setback in my opinion. but ok lets say modern times. this location is also a great starting point for some walks through the forest. theres also a nice playground for small kids. all in all a great choice for a very relaxing part of the day for the whole family.
"i have been here quite a few times now, as i still believe it is one of the most entertaining places for kids around town. we stop by for a pannenkoek and then spend some time in the playground followed by a nice walk in the park. the selection of pancakes is wide, but maybe more sweet than savory. i can have one every now and then, but i am not a huge fan, it can be a little heavy on the stomach. last time i opted for the peas soup which was nice. however in the weekends it can be a nightmare, too crowded and eternal waiting, so it can be frustrating when you have small hungry kids to keep quiet for 1 hour."
"meerzicht is located in the vicinity of amsterdam, close to the olympic bosbaan (2,2 km long rowing lake, built in 1934)."
"dreadful staff,half cooked pancakes. dirty.  go elsewhere for your pancakes, if thats what you really want to eat - somewhere where they make them individually, not in a machine run by extremely rude young men."
"it is more than average, depends what you want to do. walking through the amsterdam woods, and having a refreshment at the farm is very good.. children can play safely anf freely. pancakes all kind are delicious."

"this is one of the few real pizzerias in amstelveen. we visited it quite a few times and the atmosphere is relaxed and child friendly. the pizzas are of a good quality and thave he right size. the only thing i don’t understand is the change in the wine policy. formerly one could order wine in in a caraf of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00 cl, but now you can order only bottles of wine. this not only is much more expensive but also offers less flexibility. so please change it!"
"once upon a time this was a nice, cheap and cheerful neighbourhood italian bistro but that time sadly appears to be gone. tasteless, awful, inedible food that for a large part appears to have been bought-in from some second-rate cash and carry outlet before being inexpertly warmed up. the waiter didnt seem to be at all surprised all three of the diners plates went back largely untouched, so i dont think think the current car crash is a sudden phenomenon."
"feels genuinely italian - children very welcome, you can watch the pizza dough being spun, pasta and risotto dishes very tasty."
"was craving for a traditional udon curry. but it was an absolutely disappointment. you get a super tiny bowl of udon that you can finish in two slurp. for the price of 17 euro is was embarrassing shocking, no meat, no vegetables, just the curry sauce and few springles of spring ion. could ordered some tempura.. but as a side dish 18 euro extra for few tempura in comparison outside in amsterdam restaurants you get for half the price....was not worth it. i was out of the place in 10min. for all the japanese restaurant i have been, this is not worth the money. and not coming back to try out other tiny meals. "
"went there for dinner and was disappointed. gyu don had three pieces of overcooked tasteless beef. okonomiyaki looked nice, but was burned and covered up with mayonaise. takoyaki, fried noodles and buta kimchi itame were alright. portions were small and quality was lacking for that price. orange juice is canned and mineral water is the cheapest bottle of water you can get in the supermarket. calpis was good. "
"the noodles is okay. a bit expensive. the restaurant ambiance is cozy and suitable for young people,"
"my noodle bowl came nicely presented with broken pieces of grilled nori, the noodles and broth were quite nice, al dente and fragrant, however the shredded meat was tough and chewy, bummer. at 12 eur reasonably priced. free green tea during lunch time, nice touch."

"slow service, no advicing. food is ok in taste but not very special. interieur like kitchentables, cheap and low quality."
"i havent been here for 4 years. and after i visit it few days ago. i will never come back again. before there was service, the food is delicious and it was good!! but i got the most bad experience i have in the korean cuisine. so disappointed! its more like we were not korean so they were threaten us like outsiders. so bad service. the food was not like before so delicious like poor seasoning. too bad. "
"generally korean food is rather expensive in the netherlands compared to lets say london, where quality is also superior. the jukgaejang was rather bland and appeared to have been made with msg. chicken (dakangjung) was alright but unfortunately not boneless filet. chaeukbokkum (pork) was decent but a lot more spicy than ive had before. the service could also be a lot better. we were the first to sit down but took quite some time to have our food. tables arriving after us were getting their dishes ahead of us. it seems that a large group of korean people from a nearby church were getting the quick and attentive service at the expense of other customers."
i wont go back nor recommend this place. the food was not up to the par. the staff where friendly enough but not brilliant at there job. there knowledge of wine was very poor.

"decided to celebrate start of the school holiday by eating out, we fancied mexican so reserved cantina del corazon using ah vouchers (two 3-course meals for €37,50). once there, our kids decided to go for separate courses - as advised by the manager, cas. then he said we couldnt change it anymore as we had reserved online and he would have to pay commission on the special deal. when it was time to pay, we offered to compensate him for the commission but he refused, insisted on charging us €157 and became very unpleasant when we did not agree. eventually a lady (i think the owner) told him to back off and settled the bill for us. we left disappointed and upset. even though the food had been ok and the restaurants location is great, i definitely cant recommend cantina del corazon."

"the bartender or owner was rude and knows nothing about customer service, was rude and not friendly and the food is not even that good."
pretty good food. i wish service was a little more curteous and polite. the place is quirky and well decorated and on a sunny day im sure the terrace by the water would be a lovely place to sit out and have a corona. will certainly come back again ...for the food and location more than anything else.
we will not be returning here....food was fine but the customer contact personnel leave a lot to be desired....or may be they just dislike english ex-pats!!!! host and hostess very churlish..not friendly..in fact almost rude...served us grudgingly....and on paying the bill we discovered that apparently they have no toilets here only for themselves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! dont go here if you are desperate for the loo......good news is that a little further along the river is another very friendly looking place...next time we head there and leave this to another unsuspecting customer.
"i would leave zero stars if i could. very poor quality food. the food was stale meat, horrible taste, overcooked and to make it even worse it is not even close to authentic. they should not call themselves as an indonesian restaura "
"despite the exceptionally friendly and courteous service, it was a miserable experience. the 2 main reasons were: a) an extremely slow service where at least 20 minutes elapsed between ordering a drink and serving a drink; b) the quality of the food was so weak that even the wait staff went back to the kitchen to ask if the dish was good. if hells kitchen ever comes to amstelveen, lemon grass is a perfect location for a total turnaround"
"we had quite a good indonesian dinner here -- and i have also been to indonesia. the place was busy, and prices not expensi "
"we went here to have something different.......the staff are very pleasant but lacking in real service...we ordered a bottle of rose.....it took the 10 mins of searching that they didnt have any...we opted for a pinot grigio..they found that but it wasnt cold so we opted for beer.....we ordered the chicken satay skewers to share,a beef rendang and a nasi goreng and some steamed rice.....the skewers were really nice .....my wife got her beef which was enough to feed 2 people with enough steamed rice to feed a family....my nasi goreng came with 2 chicken satay skewers.....if i had known that i would have originally ordered prawn skewers......the food was very nice but way too much.....the service was not up to standard"
"the traditional rice tables are are clearly the highlight of the menu , 15 dishes at approximately euro 25 per head ( min 2 pax) . alacarte options are extensive , with a decent vegetarian selection .   small restaurant  with a warm and friendly  ambience"
"the pizza was fresh cooked, large and very tasty – as well as being kosher which was important to my companion. the price had surprisingly increase by €1 since they displayed their prices on the wall – from €9.99 to €10.99 but it still seemed fair. the ambience was very café like – crowded tables, help-yourself cutlery and drinks cans. quite fun overall.

a nice little find and good food. the service was excellent. the tikka lamb chops were nice albeit a bit too salty. the butter chicken was very good too.
"i went for dinner yesterday together with my family after a delightful outing the last time around. however our experience this time was not good. to start with, the service was very poor. it took around 1 hr after placing the order that food arrived. chicken tandoori was cold. the dish chicken malaiwala which was supposed to be with drumsticks as according to the menu card was made with chicken filet and when told that this is not what was written on the menu card, the waiter/ waitress came with the explanation that it was not very well translated in the english menu and that “chicken filet” in dutch means “kippen pootjes“ as was written on the dutch menu card. to top it they wouldnt serve a glass of tap water for my 4 yr old daughter and forced us to have a bottle of mineral water costing 5 euros. since i didn’t want to spoil my evening i went along and accepted it but i wouldn’t recommend this “arrogant” restaurant anyone anymor "

very bad service... waiters are veryy rude.. we asked for a warm poppadum.. reply was it is served cold sorry we can’t warm it and can’t bring new one...that was too rude.. 😡don’t recommend to anyone.. food quality is also very bad.. doesn’t taste good..
"have been there couple of times, indian food is more authentic than other indian restaurants in neighborhood especially the starters and vegetarian curries."
"i was there tonight. the ambience is pretty good, but the food is utterly disappointing. the portion sizes are shocking. you literally get two tiny pieces of bland half boiled potato and two even tinier florets of cauliflower when you order a tandoori aloo gobi for which they charge 5 euro. apart from the tiny portion sizes, the fact is that they dont do justice to the quality and taste of good they serve. let them charge me 10 euro, but please give me something that is decent and fills atleast 3-4 mouthfuls. very unscrupulous way to take unsuspecting european customers on a ride, making them believe this is actually good indian food, by providing a smile and good ambience. extremely disappointing. never going back again, and ill make sure i pass on the word"
when askd for different table the waitress had so much attitude to say a staright no....in the end turned out that thr were lots of tables empty and no one ever came on the empty tables we asked for... other waitress did not know about the menu and was rude.... qty of wine served was really poor.... im sry good food but you need a lot of improvemnt...
"accept it has good food to offer, but staff really need to improve on conduct. if you ask for tap water you get a lecture on how bad amsterdam water is.. ask for more than 4 variety of food and they can fight to convince that its not a good idea.. in short the place is not welcoming!!"
"we love indian food and living in the middle of nowhere (literally) and our closest best options being in amsterdam central we were very excited when we heard that a good indian restaurant was opening in amstelveen. my husband and i have eaten at the indian kitchen about four times now and we have had take-out once, which i think leaves me qualified to have a pretty good opinion as to how the place work "
decent food options but with good ambience. the place is expensive for its location. it is $$ for a single person.
"visited this place on the back of on line reviews rather than personal recommendation. this was a saturday night at 7.45 but actually the restaurant was 1/3 full maximum. the waiters/waitresses did not seem to know who should look after which tables, even though we were pleasantly dealt with by the individual waiter/waitresses and it took an hour from walking in to receive our starters. there was a lot of attention to the level of spiciness we wished for and we undercalled it a bit by asking for medium, the mains arrived but disappointingly they were only warm to hot , two dishes were meant to be sizzling and really were not, and the daal was nearer lukewarm. a shame as actually the favours for all dishes were good , and we easily could eat everything except the daal.i strongly suspect the kitchen was struggling with takeaways and in house service but overall this experience did not live up to the expectations that the reviews suggested. i would conclude an average curry house and fair value for money , but nothing i could not find in most uk towns ( but i dont live there anymore "
"it has been a good take away food joint for many years but turned into a restaurant and food though good, is a bit expensive for the quality and location.  i used to like their food from their take-away joint days."
"there are not many indian restaurants in amstelveen to choose from so the indian kitchen is almost always our dinner restaurant of choice (it is open only during the evenings). the menu, like almost all restaurants in the netherlands typically has various indian bread and also biryani with veggetables, chicken or lamb. the main dishes have various cottage cheese (paneer) based dishes in addition to potato - peas, peas - spinach and cauliflower based dishes. the starters are also fine. the ambience and service is nothing special as the restaurant has only couple of tables as it is mainly a takeaway place. recommended for the weekly indian meals for home-sick visitors and also for those who want a change from home-cooked food."
krokets and cola a winning combination.  this has been in the stadplein for years and on a lovely day its great to seat outside.
"while the prices are definitely on the rise, the food and service is still good.  go early or late because this is a popular place and tables are at a premimum"
after ordering food and drinks my friend and i were refused a glass of tap water. thats not even allowed. even though i live near the place i would never go back. the service people have a lousy attitude. its a shame because my friend did like her sandwich. there are better places to go. no water is a no go. 
"weve been a few times. its popular and has ample seating inside or outside. the food is ok and reasonably priced. service is dependent upon who serves you, sometimes very friendly, sometimes less so but in my experience never rude. i think its fine for an afternoon coffee or sandwich during a shopping trip in amstelveen. "
the food is what i would consider average for a cafe/ bistro in the netherlands. nothing overly special either with the menu or quality. what i did notice however was that during the busy period on the weekends the staff can not seem to be able to keep up with the dema 
"i went together a friend for a late dinner after a long business meeting and all in all its an average restaurant. the service was normal, food we ordered some shrimps and spare ribs, portions served were generous and a good glass of wine. the kitchen looks more like a fast food style. not bad if there are not other options around."
"ordering a simple cheese ham toast, i did get it on wrong bread. when i complaint that it was not the proper bread for toast, they said that this kind of bread was finished. at the same moment, another customer that was sitting next to me got a sandwiche served with the bread that suppossed was finish "
we went with my boyfriend for a quick drink. we order two orange juice and we were waiting for half an hour and the people next to us get their drinks and imagine that they came after us. i think they are racist with foreingers and they just ignore our order. never back again!
"im living in the netherlands for the next year and very close to this restaurant. i stopped there this evening for a dinner as i got back late. ill eat there again as its so close, but the service is not good. im not recommending it at all. its food, and thats about it."
"about a year ago we wanted to stop by to order a drink and relax on their terrace. the waitress told us they were about to close. but apart from that we got the sense she also didnt really feel like serving us. not a friendly woman. we went across the square to a restaurant called dixie and even though the kitchen just closed, they allowed us to order a drink and something to e "
euro 20  lunch udon looks like kid udon without any side dish.  there was a big dog in the restaurant and this is not good for  hygiene.  i will never visit here again.
new level of service in this restaurant. we made an order and ok sometimes mistakes can be made and some items might be wrong or forgotten. how likely is it that they will forget the full order? well they did. the waitress just didnt put it through. just like that. she didnt even come to apologise for forgetting. if you like sitting on your table forever like an idiot with no one bringing your food or coffee this is the place to com 
"first time in lpq in a’veen and never again. i normally go to groot gelderlandplein or in ams/ de pijp where service is outstanding and food is well prepared and proportions are generous.in aveen this experience is totally reversed. me and my friend ordered a caesar salad but to my great surprise it was not prepared with slices of real chicken but thin slices of cheap packaged cooked chicken slices and on some slices you could clearly see the veins. in addition the salad was full of big bacon cubes which had an overbearing taste in the salad.while we were eating our meal we were asked to change tables in order to allow a bigger group to take a seat! then there is the noise problem , since tables are very close to one another you do not have sufficient space and therefore lack privacy.nevertheless i maintained a calm demeanor in order to not spoil the mome "
"waitresses ignore the customers, even when you call them politely they act like a deaf and don’t respo "
"it is such a pity this shop doesn’t know the basics of customer experience. after a 5 minutes wait to be seated, nobody came. even if we saw 5 waiters, nobody dared saying hello. we then left to go to hema restaurant which was a nice experience (playground for kids, nice food and not expensive at all)."
will never visit again. appalling experience compared to other stores in the franchise. recommend to avoid.
"definitely worth a visit for a quick bite, everything fresh and very good quality. usually crowded, take away to be considered"
well placed outside the amstelveen mall area close to the monday and wednesday markets. the restaurant outside area is enclosed - inside can be noisy with the wooden floor and no soft furnishings.
"pain quotidien serves great breakfast: tartines, bread and fruit.  today our experience was sub-par: the staff was not attentive (maybe they had a great party last night) and the place was full of mosquitoes. so we quickly are our food and left."
"- ingredients were high quality, but less quantity - bad server - high price location for netherlande"
only stopped in for quick snacks during a shopping visit. clearly a place which treats young families well as the place was full of young children. the snacks were not very expensive but actually were not great value : 10 euro for an incredibly average open sandwich . one of those places you put down to experience and look for an alternative next time 
always had a tasty food here.  great place to meet friends for a coffee/lunch/dinner  great when you can sit outside   staff great but service can be a little slow
been here a few times   good is always good!   the service is hit and miss!   if your not in a hurry its worth a visit
"i had heard bad conments about the cafe, but i was surprised whn i tried the yellow pepper soup and the tuna salad: they were very good, taking into account we are talking about the gyms cafe."
tasty and fragrant food mostly for take away: the tables and chairs are placed there for a quick bite and are like a cantina.
"this is an ordinary grill-bar, not really a restaurant. one kind of beer, even though the menu card say otherwise. the burger is meat paste, not real minced meat."
"english menu helped with selection fried meats with fresh veggies, tasty relishes and breads. our service was great, able to answer menu questions and make recommendation."
i found myself very tired in the neighbourhood and was told this restaurant was near 
"i was staying at the amsterdam forest hotel opposite grill-bar rooz so decided to give it a try, mainly because i couldnt be bothered to walk very far after a full day of walkin "
"located in a mall (which is host to a lot of eateries) the atmosphere leaves a bit to desired. most of the restaurants area is taken up bby the open kitchen, bar and a waiting room for take-out orders, although there is presumably more seating upstairs."
we had a fish with a sweet and spice sauce that was obviously not self-made and almost identical to the one served with the spring rolls (which we didnt order). the dish felt like quickly thrown together with little attention to detail or authenticity. the vegetable green curry was overall better but also not memorable. service was mostly concerned about getting us out before 22:00 and forgot our drinks until after we were done with the food. this was our first visit and we wont return.
this place is probably only populair because there is little alternati 
"it was our anniversary night and we went for dinner. the ambiance is good, dim lit with private boot sitting and courteous staff. i tried palm beer (which was different & okay-ish) but the turn off was the similarity in dishes. the preparation was good but different curries did not taste that different. i was expecting much more. portion size is hu "

we were looking forward to the satay. but is was a big disappointment. it was just deep fried chicken on a stick. the sauce was col 
"as my parents are not very mobile, my brother decided to order in from thai from sky for fathers day. the food is tasty, not quite the island thai style i remember from kho panang, but then again: they might be from a different part of thailand. it takes 45 mins to have your food delivered, of which the drive from the restaurant would be about 10-15 minutes. so my brother planned ahead. what a shame however, that when the food was delivered, the driver handed over a bag with only two dishes out of the six ordered. unfortunately my nephew of 18 was not alert enough to notice. we called the restaurant, and the driver had dropped it off at another family, but we would get it soon they said. over half an hour later, no food had appeared. when i called, they explained they made it all over again, to explain for the late delivery. at which point i pointed out they should have told us because for elderly people, to have to wait another 45 minutes is just not going to do well for their health, also because my fathers medication depends on timely food. the woman apologized profusely. but still: we were dealt with two faint parents. when the - same - driver finally turned up, i asked him: did you not notice you were giving us only out of 2 bags. he just shrugged and said: i just deliver. i never look at the bags. yes, that was very clear. on top of that, apparently shrimp crisps are supposed to come with a delivery over a certain amount. no such thing. in short, food quite okay considering youre not in amsterdam. but having it delivered? not if you want a relaxed night."
very small portion....bit overpriced for the amount of food given. i am a big fan of thai food and been to many thai restaurants. i found food from here too blend and lacked spices. will stick to restaurants in downtown.
take-away delivery service is good. wide selection on the menu. we particularly like the thai curries
"i had tom ka gai at this restaurant. that is my favorite thai soup. previously i had tom ka gai at many restaurants in berlin and at golden bird in amsterdam. the portion of tom ka gai in thai from the sky was small, and in my opinion overpriced - 7,5e. it lacked galanga root, an essential ingredient of the soup. its flavor was off. very blend and lacking enough spices (insufficient lemon grass, not spicy at all, no chilies). the only visible vegetable was cilantro. in berlin in asia gourmet (cheap asian food merchandise)i got a big chunk of galanga, lemon grass, kafir lemon leaf, cilantro, chili, cherry tomatoes, large piece of chicken for 2,5e! my experience in thai from the sky was an utter disappointment."
tried the restaurant after new management took over. the food is pretty good and we enjoyed our meal. thai flavors are distinct and definitely there. the prices are on the higher side of the border and might be prohibitive if they go up.
we have tried both take-away and eat-in at this restaurant and the food is just okay. the tom kha gai soup is the best thing on the menu. pad thai is pretty bland. the restaurant itself is nicely decorated but it is in a really dreary little mall. prices seem high for this type of food.
"after having a short walk and taking some pictures of the castle, we visited this restaurant. its all fresh made with the organic products from their own garden, just at the front of the restaurant. all the dish were nicely garnished. good service and friendly staff. this restaurant has its own wine. there is an apple orchard and also a vineyard"
i have visited this restaurant last week with 4 of  
we went here for my brother-in-laws birthda 
"this was a must visit due to being invited by in-laws. what a horrible place, disinterested staff, very noisy, very smelly, food was too fat and too salty and the place is crowded by people with the sole purpose of loading a lot of food."
"proper “twents” hospitality and ample portions, even if you order xs it’s a good sized meal.  a nice outside terrace and inside has a cozy 70’s feel. service is good."
"this restaurant is an offense to all cooks...only convenience food - no fresh food and absolutly no taste. we ordered one salad with chicken, a mushroom soup and nachos.the salad was only a few of iceberg sheets, sliced, with an watery dressing and some defrosted, breaded convenience chicken. the soup was powder dissolved in water with some mushrooms out of a can. the nachos came with grated cheese (not melted!) and a mayo dip (although it said salsa in the menu) - very bad ! i do not understand the reviews here! four stars - honestly??? the hotel was ok though - the room was very clean."
"typical restaurant for truck drivers. bright lights and tv screens all around so not meant for romantic dinners. the food is relatively cheap and for that money you get a good portion of food which has a good taste. staff is friendly. if you like hamburgers, go for the bultburger. for a little over 10 euros you will get an incredibly huge hamburger with fries."
"they are very friendly, just went for a desert and a few drink.but i still don’t understand why it takes more than 15 minutes to get a drink. except this, desert was good"
"visit for the family. cant say its bad, cant say its great. the food we had was mediocre. if youre out for a quick bite, ok its fine but i dont believe money to product is as good as it should  "

"gringo’s has known times when the interior was innovative and food surprising. those times are disappearing: ambiance lively but too loud and bad acoustics. steaks lower quality than they used to be, and smaller than they used to be against higher prices. salad must have been prepared and held in the fridge for a long time: no fresh salad leaves, taste of refrigerator humidity dominating, the masking with thick dressing did not take that away.fries were nice but served not completely hot anymore. price-quality levels have gone out of balance too: price too high for what is offered. we said the salad was not tasting ok and not nice. we got apologiesand she would tell the chef. no solution offered and were fully charged. after almost 20 years of returning to gringo’s, we will have to let go of gringo’s."
we had a meal here spoilt by an obnoxious waiter who refused to give us tap water despite us having a full meal with drinks.
"used to be smaller, then they expended and became the mexican version of tgi fridays. unless you were invited i suggest you look for something else."
"dishes were over salted, had to much chemical taste enhancers, thirst, headaches and vowel aches afterwards. pity that this restaurant, once the best of town, is now only serving low cost bulk food that will lose out from any fast food joint in quality. seems togo downhill."
"nice atmosphere and if you get a window seat there is always something going on outside. ask for the meter food, its an experience in itself...."
"in this restaurant the waiter there is one of the most rude persons i;ve ever met. totally no service and la lack of knowledge about oir laws, he thought he could adjust the prices on spot"
"very bad restaurant. unfriendly owner. the service in this restaurant is very bad. unfriendly, long waiting times, etc."
i visited this restaurant with my family. it is quite cheap and there are some interesting choices. unfortunately it was a disappointment. the fryer is not cleaned regularly and that resulted in our dirty fries and nuggets for the kids. see the picture. we tried to address this concern to the waitress but it was waved away. i will not be visiting this place again. 
"the food is what you can expect from van der valk: reasonably good quality, not expensive, fair wines, quick and friendly service. we regularly have a quick dinner here and the reason to give a review this time is that the cost of somewhat upgrading the place appears to be taken out on guests. it seems regular maintenance is a reason to cut back on some things like a snack with the aperitif as we were used to for many, many years. this is annoying and we wonder whether this is good policy."
"we went for breakfast, arrived at 0930, it took them until 1010 to take the order, we had to leave, still hungry, for an appointment at 1045, due to the incredibly slow service.  still had to pay.  disappointed."
"its a nice place were you can enjoy a nice meal for a good price. atmosphere is good, friendly staff. situated at the old historical centre/ harbour of hellevoetsluis"
"service first smiled, then ignored us for 10 minutes, chatting with friends outside. i asked for belgian beer from the tap (which they have), got jupiler instead. no question for food, after we asked for some she came back saying there is not much left. would be better to tell people that in the first place. got ignored again, so i paid the bill at the bar. never encountered something that unprofessional before."
a nice and small pub-like restaurant in the fortified part of hellevoetsluis where you can have a decent meal at a decent price while enjoying a view at the harbor. they serve good sized portions of food at around €15 per di 
i have visited here quite a few times as i stay regularly at the citta romana resort in which the restaurant is situated. most occasions the service is quite slow but normally friendly staff. the menu is basic with pizza burgers chicken ribs and fish so dont expect fine dining. the food is always hot and the servings are not to bad in size and i do recommend the burger. its nice to sit outside on a summers evening but be aware that at certain times of the year there may be a lot of oil and gas workers there as the site is poplar with working nearby. i come here when i cant be bothered to cook for myself and ive never come away feeling disappointed.
food was very nice. service was slow. only managed to get one drink with our meals.  4 starters 4 mains 4 drinks 10% discount. 80 euros. not bad.  would go back. prawn cocktail is brown shrimps. tappas was really good. half chicken just that.
"good service and good food. hidden restaurant in the middle of the narrow kerkstraat, intimate inside with only two tables outside around the corner of the entrance. the tender chicken kabobs were very good."
"i had to wait 30 min for my take-away meal, even if on the website it said you can pick it up in 10 min (which is a regular time for chinese take-away). after 20 min the waitress said it was because of the mihoen i ordered, which i make at home in 3 min. there were not more than 8 people in the restaurant at the time i was there and they had already finished eating. it wasnt communicated with me that it was going to take so long. the waitress didnt speak dutch or english and communication was difficult, she seemed annoyed sometimes and difficult to rea "
"earlier it was a great restaurant. this time, we went with 4 persons to have a dinner. something was full of bacterias and i was getting sick during the dinner itself and went asap to the toilet and lost all the food. other 3 got the same few hours later. pity that the kitchen isnt clean and i am wondering that they are getting allowance to serve this kind of infected food. will not go again there, pity."
"firstly the staff were very nice, however as a treat i decided to order the black angus steak at nearly 26 euros. however when it arrived it looked way too big for a fillet steak and i couldnt cut into it.....after a bit of sawing i managed to get inside and it was completely raw.....i had ordered medium. i tried chewing a piece that i managed to cut off and it went round and round in my mouth....i couldnt chew it.....so when the waitor came over he took it back to the kitchen.......then about 5 minutes later out it came again.........not sure what the difference was as again i had real difficulty in cutting it...yet again when i managed to saw off a piece it was completely raw inside..what we in britain call blue ? the waiter said that that was how they like it in the netherlands, (so why call it the british pub and why ask patrons how they would like it cooked i wonder)?? he took it away and offered a free coffee...........i said no thanks. anyway we went to pay and they had still charged for that inedible chunk of meat?... the location was great but the food was inedible and the staff, although nice, a bit useless in this situation.....an expensive mistake."
"our waitress was incredibly friendly and helpful, the place was comfortable but the food was very average - i ordered a stuffed pepper which was pretty much a warm, but raw pepper with a bit of veg inside and cheese melted on top."
"ate here when staying at hotel montfoort, which is 20 meters aw "
"we are no lovers of the wok-concept, but this was a good try and we liked it. specially the variety of food was great. highly meat orientated: lambsrack, few kinds of beef, even kangaroo etc. all from the grill. but also sushi made in front of your eyes. and of course the real wok dishes, we liked the szechuan sauce and the thai sauce. countles kinds of deserts, free beer and wine. downside was that some of the european dishes were blend because they were heated in trays. but you dont compe for french fries here. very kind service, but of course a total do-it-yourself concept. we call it a foodbarn, but we liked it this time."
food is precooked therefor cheap. for people who cant afford a restaurant it is ok.  but i would say save a week longer and go to the neighbors   food is cheap but the drinks are expensive
good food. ordering the tapas you are ensured that you have various dishes. due to the rounds one can choose the food is guaranteed to be warm and freshly prepared.
"price quality is... something to wish for. especially if you know 20m across the street in preuverie bekkers marie they serve good food at reasonable prices. and given there is no special event, they usually have a nice spot. so not worth spending time and money here, go across the street it is much better than the beukelaer."
"sorry, but poor. rooms are not well insulated, hear everythi "
"it was very quiet,the 2 girls serving were very slow and most unfriendly. the pancakes, when they arrived, were very disappointing,small, stodgy and tasteless.would not recommend."
"reasonable for type of facility. buffet breakfast pricey but good. dinner, reasonable for this type of hotel. room up to date and clean. location is convenient"
"the sandwich we had was pretty good. though, it was not what we ordered. since it looked delicious and hate to waste, we accepted it anyway. again, the food was excellent but i’m a little disappointed by the service."
being in zaans schans where the chocolate factory is we wanted to try a hot chocolate. we asked the owner if they had local hot chocolate and he replied with “of cours 
"we came in around 2:30 pm, the restaurant was not very full and we didn’t get our food until 3:49 pm. the waitress never put in our order and forgot about it for the whole hour. a family sitting next to us came in twenty minutes after us and they received their food first, so we asked the waitress and she realized she never put it in and didn’t even bother to check on us for the past hour. due to her limited english, she apologized in a very rude way. the food was okay though, but overpriced. will not recommend to anyone. "
"i wanted soup and salad and a sandwich... mustard soup tasted too heavily of mustard from the jar, maybe it should taste like that? they didn’t understand simple greens for salad, but i did not want their entree salads that were the most expensive items on lunch menu. they did comply, serving me a few leaves in a bread bowl, which could not be cut or dressed with the delicious olive oil. i saved it for my sandwich "
"it was a beautiful, warm day and the outdoor tables were a great place for lunch. service was acceptable--attentive at first and then less so when the place filled up. burgers were good. nothing astonishing, mid-range prices. tip: it seems no one in the netherlands accepts credit or non-nl debit cards. plan to bring cash."
poor service and no guest caring. we had to leave for a certain time and they kept made late. we are not going back.
stopped in here after being dropped off by a bus tour to visit zaanse schans. we got soup (pretty sure the spinach soup had a chicken stock base so be careful vegetarians) and a sandwich. it was nice to get warm and out of the wind and rain but the food was average and the service the same.
dreadful experience at this restaurant where they refused to serve us for turning up 10 minutes late!!! the chef was shockingly rude and we will never return.
"the staff was friendly, and we ordered the menu with an ok price, the rest of the menu was quite expensive and we were surprised on how big the dishes were but how incredibly small portions were. the food was great quality but i would have needed 3 menues to fulfill my stomach and im a slim person that doesnt eat too muc "
my family and i ate 3-courses set. the starter played an important role in our dinner because they were the only edible dish 
"very stylisch place, good atmosphere and high quality service, but the food could have been better tough. i mean, you could see the effort in trying to pull out a sofisticated start-restaurant-alike menu, but the results were medium. one dish that i had was proposing too many flavours at the same time, and another one was not served at the right temperature (the soup was too cold for my taste). i was exepecting more, especially for the price we paid."
"i have been looking forward to trying out this place for a while. unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations. firstly, when we arrived, we were asked for drinks without seeing a menu, and this was the only contact with the staff for an hour. we had to ask for the menu ourselves. the menu on the website was not up to date, so it was a bit surprising that there was no vegetarian option when we arrived. from all dishes that were offered, there was only one meet-free, fish free starter. it was the most expensive on the list, and i am not sure it was worth the money. the staff did not offer to create a dish for the person on the table, who could not order a main dish. in any case, overall the food was nice, but service was terrible. we had our starters and mains, and then waited for another hour for the deserts. we again had to ask what happened, and we were informed that there was a miscommunication with the kitchen. one person on the table then got a desert, the rest had to wa "

"this place is typical for this area: overpriced, small portions and a clueless staff. clearly this “brasserie” is particularly for holiday goers and boomers (there is nothing else around so lets go here). a shame in my opinion as the location itself has good potential for a nice casual dine in experience."
"we attended this restaurant on two occasions .the first (for a lunch) , we had a good experience. sadly the second experience wasnt so good ! we called in for an evening meal and ordered our choice > the restaurant was quite busy and we noted the owner/manager was sat near the front door observing . in fact he had been sat in that position and seat we we had been there befor "
"a very old iinn-place, located at the country road. it still has features of what it has been like in the past, which i like. extended with a veranda, it offers a nice place for breakfast, lunch and diner, or just for a bite.open all day. diner in the veranda is pleasant, but it is very noisy. service is smooth & swift. for the food they serve, traditional dishes, and the quality of this food, but more the quantity (smallish portions) the dishes are over-priced. small portions also for the wine (10 cc). convenient place when it is on your way, but not enough reasons for me to return."
"ordered basic 2 burgers, my girlfriend has allergies so had to pair one meal down, but when we received the meals, they were the fully loaded meals at €19 each! we couldn’t finish them, as we only wanted a light bite. with soft drinks it came to €46! i can’t help but feel this was a tourist rip off! you better say you want the single burger only very clearly, otherwise you maybe get the most expensive version. there’s many better places to eat around there , i will never go back there!"
"terrible place. the soup was too salt, the toast limp and the butter was over date. very bad kitchen, avoid this restaurant!"
the vegetables of the ratatouille were blackened from the outside and raw on the inside. it was a simple but expensive dish. the potatoes with the dish tasted like fried in older frying fat.
"the village is pittoresk with many historic buildings and a stroll is a pleasure. dinner on a monday is a challenge and we were happy to conquer a table at vismarckt. friendly staff, bit “quasi-rural” venue. it is a very loud place and tables are close together. the wc is tiny. my daughter took the €25 menu and liked the starter but was not impressed by the taste of the small soles. my fish soup was fine but the duck was too well done. "
we went there with 6 people for dinn 
the restaurant is part of the van der valk hotel and is similar to many in this chain. the choice of food for lunch was reasonable.  decent service. slightly overpriced.
"we had dinner at the restaurant here, and both ordered a wagyu burger with bacon and cheese. the glasses of wine we ordered were filled less than a quarter, and the burgers were served well done. as a consequence the meat was completely dry, robbed of all its taste by fatty lukewarm cheddar and a cardboard like strip of bacon. the bread was a standard hamburger bun, spongy and bland. no additional sauces or pickles were served with it, and the tastiest element on the plate were the cherry tomatoes. the cook managed to turn wagyu beef into a complete disaster. on top of that a nice conversation at the table was disturbed by a large group of people having a party at the other end of the room. our conclusion: we will not return to this place."
big restaurant that can facilitate a lot of people makes the place not very personal .nothing wrong with the food and the service but its was just a meal. to ordinary for my taste. take your girlfriend somewhere else if you a looking for a romantic evening.
"it was rather busy when we were here, so i assumed the food was going to take longer to prepare.  this wasnt the case, the food was served pretty swift and tasted lovely.  only downfall were all the kids running around that night..."
"my wife and i walked over from delft and stopped to have a coffee. the restaurant is next to the windmill, not inside. its been freshened up with paint and new (but rustic) furnitur "
"de vang eten en drinken is situated in a former granary, built a century ago, belonging to the heritage flour mill next to the restaurant. by the way, this windmill is still in operation. for parking the car there is a reference to a parking lot belonging to the ijsclub (ice skating club) behind the restaurant, but this area was very muddy on this day and not suitable for parking. we found alternative parking in a residential area beyond the roundabout in front of the windmill; getting there by car is a bit tortuous, but parking spaces are available close to a foot bridge, which brings you back to the roundabout. the interior of the restaurant is a bit quaint; also the number of tables is limited to about twelve. service of the staff is prompt and polite; a pleasant surprise. generally speaking de vang is a nice restaurant with skillful and ambitious staff. therefore its a pity that food preparation is a bit casual. fresh ingredients are used and the chef and his staff seemed skillful, but i am afraid that presentation has too much precedence to food preparation. my starter, thinly sliced smoked beef, was basically delicious; the amount of rocket is a dutch vice i am accustomed to, but the dish was spoiled by an excess amount of mayonnaise. the main course, pork slices, was for a large part tasty and succulent, but one piece of pork was a bit tough. the dessert, hazelnut brownie, was delicious without reservation, but the creme brulée, one of my table companions had ordered, looked to me more as some sort of runny pudding. fortunately, she assured me that the taste of the dish was ok. in my opinion restaurant de vang offers a nice sit-down in a quaint atmosphere, with skillful staff. there is room for improvement in the care for preparing the dishes."
"althought the view terras is stunning, we do not recommend this restaurant. the food of my partner was frozen (apparently they do not prepare it fresh), my own fish was still raw, the steak of my son wasnt. apparently the cook has a serious problem with timing, even as the restaurant was near emp "

"when you arrive at de nar, it looks like a little café. but do please enter, because they have an nice garden where you can have dinner. the menu is nothing special, but everything tastes good. prices are normal and you can park almost next to the restaurant."
"the food was so so! we were served our food, started eating and then the plates were taken away because it was an order for another table. instead of taking the plates back to the kitchen, it was taken straight to the table it was suppost to be for. that was a very strange experience."
"we came in around 5:30 p.m., because we were going to the theater after dinner. several people already were sitting at the bar. the extremely correct hostess took us to our table. on bringing our drinks, the hostess noticed our theatre booking and reported right away that the food serving would be no problem. extremely attentiv "
very friendly staff but food was nothing special. location is convenient to railway station and hotel vorbuurg
" restaurant looked really nice from the outside, cozy atmosphere inside. nice sta "
last thursday i went to pempek elyssia for take away fo 
"went here for take out. ordered beef rendang, gado gado and extra white rice for one. we paid about 20 euro. the rendang was 4 small piece of meat, container of nasi and some vegetables. we were disappointed bij the amount of meat and taste. in other indonesian tokos we had better and paid less. i asked for a little bit of white rice and got the same size container as the nasi. which was for 2 persons. next time i will go somewhere else for indonesian food."
a cute little authentic indonesian restaurant. friendly owner. various foods from noodle soups to various rice dishes. the indonesian ice dessert are good. most of the time the food quality is good sometimes less. but you can always give your feedback to the owner and she will take care of it.
"we walked in at 12noon as stated opening hours at the door and was asked if we wanted to dine in or take away. my reply was take away and the lady at the counter said they dont have that kind of chinese food and they target mainly the caucasians. well, my skin is yellow and so is hers! thanks for the heads up, we missed chinese food thats why we walked in and left with loss of appetite!"
"this is one of the few places in voorburg where your can bring your (small) children and be relaxed.there are toys for them to play with and a little desk to sit at. and of course a nappy changing station in the toilet. i love the reading table/desk where there are many magazines to choose from, excellent! food is not exquisite but good for lunch of breakfast, service is fast!"
had a large party here recently: 50-60 guests from 6 till 11 p. 
nice restaurant and clean.  good for lunch.  food and drinks reasonable price and service ok.  pasta with prawns and chicken sate are good.
"the interior is looking well taken care of, the service was a bit slow. that was strange because there were enough waitresses walking aroun "
this place needs new management. food and coffee (illy👌) were good but the staff (young girls/ladies) were completely unattentative to guest 
"had a club sandwich, mediocre bread and dito chicken. quick service, good for a cheap lunch. noisy neighbours upstairs.."
"avoid, avoid, avoid. booked dinner on a saturday evening with friends- service was bad 35 mins to wait to take the order then when we got the main course it was cold. finally got rushed out the door the the staff locked up the restaurant, laughed at us so they could do the accounts - worst restaurant i have ever eaten in"
the lounge can be quiet and there is a fireplace.  the menu and food is of average quality.  the value for the price is average.  wait staff are friendly.
we visited here on our trip for a quick lunch near the city where our friends were marri 
"very unfriendly, rude staff. you had to wait outside, while others popped in (selective gate keeping). chaotic, unorganized."
"visited for the first time recently, as i was told their chicken cashew is super. it indeed is, delicious! service though i thought sucked, or i had a case of bad luck. in confusion about options for vegetables in the menu, the step of deciding which vegetables i’d want got skipped and before i knew what was going on i had already payed for the menu of 2meat+4vegetables + half egg, and was sent out with only nasi and chicken cashew and no vegetables or egg in the ba "
"good tasting food. they offer all-you-can eat special on weekends. nice selection of alcoholic drinks. be aware they tend to miss a dish or two, if you order 5 or more in one go, especially during weekends."
this restaurant is a nice and good variation on the asian all you can eat concept. it is all about tapas. you can choose from cold and warm dishes. both meat and fish. veggies lovers will be dissapointed here. there is not much choice for them. though the mushrooms in garlic sauce are delicious! you can have cocktails for 5 euros but better order a bottle of wine or a can of sangria. the gambas and the fish dishes were that day exceptionally good. service is friendly and adequate. this is a fine restaurant to take your kids to.
"we like tapas and mezze a lot and eat them at home and outdoors in nl and many other countries. this restaurant has an all you can eat formula, with low quality - mostly fried- food, unexperienced staff and huge cocktails filled with soda. this is not dining, but stuffing yourself with carbs and fat! "
"the service was great. food was up and down, the dishes arent all the same size. therefore you didnt really know what to expect. they make you pay for everything that is leftover. would have loved to try more different dishes. the beenham was a bit dry. but the garnalen en kaas kroketjes were amazing! "
"we ordered 2 meals ( take away). the staff were friendly, but the food was not special, seems it was lacking spices. also the meals didnt have enough ingredients (small portions with 50 gr or a bit more meat and mostly onions (not much vegetables)). rice was also less compared to other indian restaurants. the stew was basically like soup ( mainly sauce and not enough meat and vegetables). average portion was 15 euros, so not even cheap. we wont go back there."
this food is only italian for people who have never eaten italian.. low quality cooking with overcooked lasagna drowning in sauce and fast-food level pizza... profoundly disappointed
"we stayed in the gr8 hotel next to the restaurant and had two breakfasts and one dinner here. the food was good but the service was questionable. the staff were friendly and helpful but they ran out of ingredients, ran out of cutlery and plates so that they recommended breakfast cereal be eaten from a water glass. the staff were nice to our young children and gave them treat bags at breakfast time. they had run out of many food ingredients by 7 pm for dinner."
"weve tried this laplace out several times but we are sad to say this one did not train their personel well, every time the food was overcooked, not tasty or burned (pizzas). were fans of laplace but there is a huge difference in how they prepare their food. bodegraven is bad so far. "
food is good quality. but i was shocked as a paying customer they do not offer a bathroom. you must pay the company pipi 70cent. not customer friendly for an expensive bite on the road.
this place is open until 21:00. do not make the mistake of showing up after 18:00. a lot of stuff is sold out. friendly personnel but you feel like they would rather go home
great for kids but... service was lackin 
it was a nice day so the children could play outside and watch the animals while we chatted with our friends. we were there on sunday at lunchtime and the restaurant was otherwise empty! pancakes were fine but not very special.
"we visited here because we wanted to have lunch, but ordered coffee first. the waitress serving the coffee accidentally put her hand in one of the cups and spilled coffee on the saucer. she left and we thought she would come back with a new cup and to clean up but she didnt. another waitress brought the menus, and despite relatively high prices we wanted to order but then nobody showed up for fifteen minutes to take our order. so we decided to leave. not a good experience."
"this pancake house has a perfect location, enough space to park your car and bike. also, the restaurant has a large fenced-in playground/petting zoo which keeps your children happy. you can sit on the deck and enjoy the sun while the kids run around (but cant get away "
went there with the kids in the summer. the location is nice with parking space for cars and there is a small playground outside which the kids liked a l 
"ate there a couple of times. the tapas are excellent, but the service was very poor on each occation"
"had an ok meal here with family, company was very good. waiting staff were a little slow. this didnt spoil our eating experience."
"visited here with a friend on a monday. it was a challenge to find a parking spot in the neighbourhood. the location is on the waterfront, but doesn’t seem to have a terras. the windows were dirty, which did not give a good impression. the restaurant was not very busy with mostly older visitors. food was ok, not great. we’ll try another place next time."
"i will give my opinion on this restaurant on relative scale for bodegraven, since there are very few good restaurants in the vicinity. positive points are that the food is fresh and good ingedients, but very old style dutch cuisine, you can imagine it being similar to the food served in this location 100 years ago (there has been a restaurant in this place since 1898 see their web site), except that the chicken now is replaced by guinea fowl and they didnt have scampis in that time. it is located at the old lock so a historical place and convenient to eat there if you are passing by boat, unfortunately there is an ugly white building on the corner that needs some painting that spoils the view. the food is a bit heavy with much butter but otherwise tasty and it is not at all expensive. a big negative is the fact that they dont have a wine list so if you dont like the house wine you have to switch to beer as the only alternative. very attentive staff compensates for the negative points."
"arrived back late after long cycle ride (120km) & my wife rang to say was with friends at this cafe and the kitchen was closing in 10 minutes. so got there super quick and had a large beer, and my wife & friends were served food. thought might have a few frites etc so asked if we could have an extra plate - told would be €2.50 extra, so declined that, wasnt really needed anyway. then was asked to move my cycle - from the outside area - no one sat out there, kitchen closed so no more guests coming in and only 10-12 inside the restaurant. realising that i was not really welcome, decided not to have a second beer there and went instead to nearby natte pij, which had a much better beer selection, and more welcoming service - plus they didnt mind where i put my bike."
"the starter, a deep fried fish pastry , was all new to our taste and so were the korean flavoured vegetables and the fried ball containing koran rice with cheese. something new and all together different from what you know, that is why you go for something exotic like korean food, right? alas, after this promising start it turned out to be a regular bbq with regular fish, prawns, pork and steak. nothing exotic to it , except for the soy sauce and that could not make up for the missing amenities like various fatty - but-oh-so-good sauces that make a western style bbq so irresistible. also, the french fries are really bad. all in all: you can eat well and as much as you lik "
nice food but they dont take english credit or debit cards...an embarrasing end to an otherwise pleasant evening...i wont be back..
you’d think that if they open at 9 they would start cooking at 8.30… but no i walked in 9.10 and all they had was tomato soup and the most greasy cheese snack ever. won’t be coming back for breakfast that’s for sure
"came in before 8pm (closes at 9pm) and they were cleaning up already, no soup anymore, no salads. saw even that when the last vegetables were removed, a whole crate with vegetables fell on the floor and they were put back with the other ones.. "
just one toss away from getting the award for worst pizza ever!   i excpect this place soon will be buried next to the former hotel next door..
"we arrived at la place at 20:45 hrs last night, kitchen is open untill 21:00 h "
"when the la place concept was introduced some 20 years ago it was such a great concept! i came to this particular one last time 5 years . got hear today one hour before the kitchen closes. the tables were only occupied for 10%, yet most unoccupied tables had dirty trays on them. the nice concept of life cooking is that you can quickly add items. i wanted to order a vegan wok dish, but most vegetables were out. the service staff told me that the dish was out. other items were out as well. i managed to get a tomato soup and a vegetarian bread roll. bottled drinks were not chilled, the container with tap water was empty and the service station an absolute mes "
"this la place is located right of a12 in maarsbergen. fresh ingredients serving menu of various sandwiches (ham & cheese, salmon, cheese and my favorite tuna). pizzas are $9.95 for either margarita, quattro formaggi, or tuna with fresh made dough baked in a wood oven. they have a salad bar with many grilled vegetables and lettuce salads, 3 fresh soups (tomato was good), and thai wok of mixed items. their grill has chicken, steak, and veggie burger with frites or baked potatoes. steak is good flavor with 2 sauces. drinks of juices, vitamin waters, tea, coffee, beers and wines. dessert bar is great with many different sweets like apple pies, chocolate pies, and even sorbet. good for quick foods. "
"coming in asked for a table for two and seated on advice of a waitress we did not get serviced, even more bad the gues woman camt after 15 minutes to tell us to go away because we did not have a reservation. never again tante truus. bye bye"
"wed heard good things about this restaurant so whilst visiting friends in utrecht we decided to give it a try. first of all it took ages for anyone to seat us, then another ten minutes passed before we were even asked what we wanted to drink. our drinks order seemed to have been forgotten, so when we grabbed a waitress to ask her, she acted as though she was too busy to answer us, huffing as she went. the drinks finally arrived and our food order was taken at last - by which time wed pretty much gone past being hungry. eventually, after another ridiculously long wait, the food started coming out in but nothing was together. members of our group were having to eat alone so it didnt go cold. what we did get was cold and lacked flavour or spice - even the supposedly spicy dishes. absolutely dreadful. with so many other restaurants in utrecht, this one should be avoided."
"had dinner here and found the food tasteful, however price/quality wise it is just okay. and i prefer different restaurants in the region with a much better price/quality."
im not a traditional person so i like it when a restaurant tries new concepts. however like with anything out of the ordinary you need to make sure the ordinary is in plac 
"based on the old square of the village of houten it is in a nice neighborhood. you can park two hours for free on the square. its based between several shops, bars and restauran "
"we went there for a lunch and we were all really disappointed about the food and drinks we ordered. drinks were tasteless and my goat cheese bread was really sad; it was only the bread.. wheres the goat cheese and other nice things?? plating was poor looking and i was wondering why did i pay 10€ for this..? i believe this is a good place to go for a coffee, but not for eating. "
"the coffee is good but the service is a bit zo-zo. there is one barista and like 6 waiters, so the orders dont come too quickly. so good if youre not in a rush."
"after my visit a few months ago, i hoped the service was improved. unfortunately, it definitely did not. when me and my friend entered the restaurant, all the staff was watching us, without a simple hello or good afternoon. we had to wait for 10 minutes before someone came to take our order, while there were only 2 other tables. the coffee was great, the sandwich i ordered not so much. moreover, when we wanted to order another drink, we had to wait for another 15 minutes. it is too bad there is a lack of hospitality, otherwise it would be a nice place."
"these were all due to the information on the website was not sufficient for us to make a good decision. when we planned to stay in houten, the information from the hotel only showed ‘near to the train statio "
the food that we ordered wasnt the highest quality. meet wasnt tender and the vegetables werent cooked well enough. also cold food was served on hot plates. this in combination with poor services wont let me come back ever again. 
a bizarre hipster hotel. or is it a hotel? i stayed two nights and im still not sure  
"again we had a dinner at parthenon not because we think this is top of the bill but just because we like greek food and it is nearby. friendly service, nothing wrong with the seating and a average menu, just greek food. they are trying to get some more attention by having specials but still...just greek food"
"we love greec food so we regularly go to this restaurant. the food is nice, the prices ok and the ambiance is ok too. but it is nothing very special. you just have a very nice evening with good food here."
the lamb chops were chewy and way too well done. the meats were very salty. the tsatzikki was good. the fries werent even very good or fresh and the service was bad. only came to the table once for the order and once to drop off the food.
the service is owkay and fast. the pancakes are really nothing special. this is how everybody can make them at home. but then you make them better. im sorry maybe we had a bad day for this restaurant.
"the restaurant is nicely situated at the main road. you can sit inside or outside. service is good, food is good, prices reasonable. everything is how it should be. hard to find anything either excellent or bad. it is average. nice to go with your family or friends, before or after a day on the leusder heide or in den treek."
the location is along the main street of doorn. we did take away but we should wait for a while as there was a long queue of people who also did take away. it seems that this restaurant is popular by the local.
"you get a list/menu and you can choose 5 snack size items, 5 times. you have to finish what you order. lots of choice, chinese and sushi. we really enjoyed this."
"this restaurant serves as the only chinese food restaurant in the neighborhood. since decades chinese restaurants in the netherlands have developed a taste that suits the dutch well. this restaurant understands this tradition well. the babi pangang is as it has to be. the take away service is good, friendly and quick. ordering by phone is possible and works well. service in the restaurant is friendly. the place is friendly for children. half portions are available."
being skipped when our drink order is being taken is what i call pretty bad service. so i would never come back here again. dont waste your time.
chalet helenaheuvel is an ideal place to stop for drinks or lunch when exploring the beautiful kaapse bossen (forest) in the utrechtse heuvelru 
i did eat here people are not caring anyone they are not working only walking they dont care for the coustemer. also food is not so good.  i never want go again
this is a so called pancake restaurant of which we have many in the netherlan 
"if you are looking for a family restaurant, where the kids have all the space to enjoy themselves in an child friendly environment... don’t go here. the restaurant is ok, food is ok, but there is not a real playing area inside. even outside it is not as expected. but, as said, food is good :-) "
"a lovely eating place, with an adjacent shop selling high quality foods (including local products). the cafe serves a nice selection of food and there is a childrens menu. a nice smell of freshly brewed dutch coffee greets you on arrival. the staff are young and friendly. the food is nicely presented and is tasty."
"had a pleasant stay, lots of choices in tapas, fixed menu prices so don’t plan for a short stay or a couple of bites.... toilets @ first floor - stairs only"
had lunch at this place a few times. is always busy and good choice for lunch. went for an evening dinner: was disappointing. little choice (kitchen is too small: can not cope with full diner service).
the food at this restaurant was good.  the service was very friendly and attentive.  reasonable prices.
"we recently gave this place a try using our albert heijn discount stamps which offered the second 3 course menu for free. it allows you to choose from a preset 3 course menu with the following choices: meat, fish or surpri "
"disappointing experience. schnitzel was spoiled, vegetable not fresh. after complaining, the owner came to get a very irritated story. very aggressive attitude. the owner does not know customer-friendliness."
the staff in the hotel and restaurant is very friendly. the food is just lacking the extra mile. not bad for a hotel and always a juice to go but not my preferred place to go
"well, we ordered the food by phone and picked them up from the restaurant. i was actually surprised by seeing a lot of choices on the menu in their website. however, it makes it more difficult to make a decision  "
"the drinks were generous and cheap. the food was inedible. thats all i have to say. i have had inedible food about twice in my life thats how bad it was. i would give no stars if possible. my husband and i had totally different meals and his was also awful. i ordered a salad which never came probably good my husbands salad was disgusting, watery. plus we waited 30 minutes for our food with no one in the restaurant!"
"very nice prices at this restaurant. it has italian food plus mexican, pizza, and a good mixture of other entrees. i had a glass of house wine for $3.50 and canneloni for $9.50. max entrée price was under $20."
i am not sure if they are under new management but we eat here often and i have been seeing a lot of new faces lately. the quality of the food does not suffer from it but the quality and speed of service unfortunately do 
"stayed the night this month at babylon. american style motel with restaurant. we arrived 20.30 and kitchen open till 22.00. nobody at the reception .. you need to start to search for help. restaurant is ok, we ordered hamburger and sate. simple orders and still the waitresses could not get right. slept well .. room was cool and low noise."
"went by for a quick spot of lunch. waited for 60 minutes for just a hamburger, tosti sandwich and a carpaccio salad...  staff unfriendly, food not filling - not worth one star..."
"the titel eetcafe made us stop here. in general an eetcafe has a fun menu, a little bit of everythin "
a really good place for mothers who want to have some nice chats during lunch time with girlfriends.
"great place to be on a sunny day. very comfortable lounge furniture invites to relax when having a drink. felt very well here with my friend. unfortunately my caesar salad was absolutely disappointing, made without any touch of effort. some leaves of salad, few eggs and fried chicken. no capers, no anchovy’s and sauce without any taste.."
"arrived at 2pm waiting for 20min and asked 6 times to place my order. after i went to the bar for a 2nd time, someone found the decency to follow me to our table to take the order. 30mins passed in the meantime. another 30mins until the food came out. food was extremely disappointing and wonder why two slices of bread with salmon and the other with tuna takes 30min? the visit ended with waiting for 20min for the bill. in the meantime people around us left without paying. staff though was very friendly. i felt sorry for them. they were doing their best but they obviously have a manager who has no clue how to manage and plan for a busy summer day. i will not go again..."
"ive bough a ticket for an event at this venue. arriving at the location, the customers are confronted with a mandatory toilet charge already at the door. if you refuse to pay, they will not let you in and the money that you have paid for the event will be forfeit. never again. i am surprised people never wrote about this here."
we stayed in the hotel and on the last night we ate he 
"we were with a group and had to wait quite a long time for our food. the waiter (owner) of the restaurant was constantly asking if we wanted more drinks, it almost felt like they in purpose prolonged our stay to make us pay as much as possible. the food wasnt that bad, but not great either. especially for the price we had to pay. in the end i payed like €90,- for me and my girlfriend. for some people this doenst sound like much. but my friends had to pay a lot more, mostly for the drinks because we were waiting so long for our food. i dont want to bash to hard on the restaurant, maybe we just had a bad expierence and it has since been better. but im not recommending the place to go at all."
the pancakes are pricy but taste well. don’t go sit inside it smells like 1930. everything looks quite poor and it’s just not so appealing. there is a nice playground for kids and it’s close to the beach so thats good.
ate here for a family event. great place if you fancy fast service and fast food. avoid when you are not into brutal noise or otherwise bring earplugs. some would say great for families but i would want to five my kids a different experience...
"if you like to spend time sitting at a terrace watching the children play and families enjoy, this is great. sip your tea or coffee, order a snack or small meal and doze through the day if the noise is not to loud. have a beer and continue your holiday! take life as it comes here and maybe visit the museum nearby. ample parking place if not high season. walk to the beach as an exercise, just a few km in the most beautiful dune landscape of nl/europe  "
the restaurant is located near the dunes / forest. great place to eat after youve had a walk. they offer several gluten-free and vegetarian options. some dishes can be made vegan on request. many options for kids. playground outside. free parking. relaxed atmosphere.
"on a family reunion, spent a couple of hours here. nice place, close to the beach of the north sea. had lunch as well. food was ok. friendly people."
"on a sunny day after a walk in the woods (do not forget to buy a ticket (duinkaart)), stopped for a coffee and lunch. nice kids playground and small childrens zoo."
"a nice an quiet place bordering the kennemer duinreservaat. everything prepared with local( organic )  ingredients. tasty, but value for money could improve, quite overpriced. also something could be done regarding the acoustics of the place."
we ended up here on a sunday night when we had to find something last minute for a bite to eat. it was a beautiful day so the patio was very crowded but inside it was nice and quiet and relaxed. the décor as well as the food and wine are all good but nothing spectacular. on the other hand the prices are very reasonable so overall you can have a decent meal for a decent price. 
service and prices are good. wine prices also okay.  however. in my opinion food is prepared in advance and then heated by micro wave.  we ordered nasi goreng and sate . chicken meat not so nice.  ragout bitterballen were very good.
we had some  quick bites for a lunch here on the busy patio on a beautiful day. service and food was pretty decent as long as youre not looking for a fine dining experience. prices very reasonable as well.
"terrible for the price you pay. id rather go to an all you can eat restaurant where they serve the food to you. even though some dishes where prepared by the chefs immediately, everything is bland and tastes like garlic. we were done within 1 hour and went to another restaurant. this is great for groups or when you dont mind to eat food that has been prepared 3 hours ago."
we went to the restaurant wich was recommanded by friends of ours. the atmosphere in the restaurant is nice and there is a playing part for kids. so far so good. the ordering went smoothley and the food was served in normal time. i ordered the fish and chips. it was a disaspointment. the fish was deep fried in oil. not once but at least to times. it was dry on the inside and the crust was totaly burned. the tast was horrible. the french fries were burned to. they should have stayed to the pancakes as main dis 
weve been there spontanious with a large group of people and the stuff found us a place to sit despite the restaurant was very busy. pancakes is one of the specialities and they were very good.
"we ate at de heeren janssen on friends invitation, who had had previous good experience with steaks there. we were all disappointed and our friends were embarrassed, but did not complain, because the serving personnel was so nice. it is the food. three of us had steaks, but none of them were good - it was hard to chew that meat. there were little cooked vegetables on the plates, compensated with potato chips with mayonnaise (!) on the side... the kitchen should improve."
"we had a nice evening chatting, eating and drinking. however apart from the kroketten nothing outstanding, actually all the meat not cooked very well (nobody asked how we wanted it), or maybe not the best quality, and all rice served in paella etc very porridge like and overcooked, little fresh vegetables. servers all very nice, kitcen a bit sloppy as we asked for no curry sauces and still got it.... drinks quite pricy not to say expensive for such a place. even served water only by the bottle and paid (tap water would have been fine. all over spent nearly 30 euros pp on food and 10 euros on drinks which is not a little for such a place. nevertheless had a nice evening and reservations and table fine."
"with tapas i would have expected spanish food, but its a fusion of dutch, asian and italian foid in small portions. some are great, some are mediocre. environment is nice and service is quick."
"the all you can eat menu includes a lot of dishes which are all average. nothing is really good, and all the tastes used are familiar. this made it unappealing, especially when comparing the food quality with the prices. some of the staff were friendly, some not. the decoration of the restaurant is nice but the details are not (e.g. usage of a cheap bench). for this location and price, we expected way better food."
"we ate at buon gusto before going to the theater. the wine was quite good and our dinner, pasta with seafood and risotto with chicken liver was well prepared, but kind of blend. the ingredients were fresh, but the seasoning could be more pronounced."
"access to the disabled toilet denied although i have an eu key for disabled toilets and have a 70 severe disability. such a thing does not work at all, sorry!"
this isnt the worst chinese food i have ever eaten but also certainly not the best. it appears like all food comes with the same sauces which creates 1 single flavour amongst all dishes. the babi pangang was roasted very well though.
toilet buildings are unhygienic - in fact no soap on any of the toilets on campsite. looks worn and could really do with a renovatio 
"after 3 months went back there, as this used to be a place with good food and nice prices. today, the food is still good. but.........no way. most of the eaters come there with a discount system like groupon or so. we not, so we had to pay extra for the salad????? sorry, for me this was the last time i went there without a discount ticket., if the owner wants to work that way......"
"have tried some ordered food en was quite ok, so one saturday when i was in the are we decided to have small lunch. the service is very nice, and the food is good, price...would say a litle bit overprised, but not bad. at the end, it is a nice place to go"
"burger wasnt served as listed on the menu. server took the burger back, didnt replace it, made several excuses regarding limited staff, but refused to take the burger off the bill. will never visit again, and would advise to avoid."
"the place is noicy, but the food is ok. waiters are running around, but no idea where they are going. at the end it is acceptable for something to eat, but not for going out"
twice within 5 minutes we got cold  instead of hot coffee. reason was machine break down nut ut was only gold after seconde complaint. never again to this restaurant.
"have not been in this reestaurant for a while, and now it moved to a new place. we choose the openings menu. it was clear that the black brigade was new and very unexperienced, however the brigade in the kitchen has also performed better. serving an entrecote without asking how it should be done, is not as it should be, for sure not on this level. the ravioli as accaptable, but all togeter very heavy. the lasagne of vegetable was great, the tartare of tunfish not bad. all together, they should improve to come back to old level"
"nice restaurant to eat, various of meals. meals are good, the price is also average, location is nice and in the summer you can sit on the terras outside. try it and you will not be disappointed."
"the food is average.  on the other hand both the environment and services are very good, which really elevated the experience.  i can see myself come here for coffee and cake with friends."
"this actually is a grand café with the emphasis on the restaurant role of the venue. i have visited this place several times for diner and lunch and even for the odd beer or hot chocolate. the menu offers a few choices of meat, fish and vegetarian dishes and are not very adventurous. the quality and size are substantualy above average and service is fairly quick. winelovers will be disappointed to find out their only choice is between the colour. a more varied wine-list would have resulted in a higher rating. overall a nice place in the heart of the center with a cavern for kids to play while the parents enjoy their meal."
"my first and last use of this bar/restaurant was horrid.  no great choice of food , no other people using it, but only 400 meters  from my home.     however with new owners the outside area seems always full. menu????? no idea. it must be better."
"we had a drink and later on also dinner here. when the weather is nice, sir outside. the staff is  very friendly and the food is ok, although we thought somewhat overpriced."
"not bad if you got a craving but very salty food, everything is dialled to 11 in salt. got the mixed greek plate, around 300g of meat. some chips, rice and salad on side, but no pita unfortunately."
i had my dinner with my colleague tonigh 
the service is very friendly but the food wasnt great. we think that the chef might have had an off night cause this place was recommended as being very good. they did take our comments on board so next time we hope that the meat wont be so dry and not everything out of a tin.
"the food was mixed the toasted bread and the ‘reibekuchen’ were great. the ‘zuurvlees’ was lukewarm, small portion and not that tasty. the fries were ok.  the view is fabulous and the service is ok."
"been coming to the lodge for years, always ordering the same dish: the club sandwic "
"we had a good lunch. service was excellent and the view is always spectaculair.  the food was good, but serving it on a hot plate would have been really great. especially for french fries!"
"we came to this restaurant as a large family group. though we had reservations, and the inside of the restaurant was completely empty, they decided to seat us outside on the patio. the tables they had reserved had us sitting all separately, and some members of the party sitting in very harsh, direct sunlight. most resaurants would help accomidate people, but we ended up having to move tables/chairs ourselves to try to get most of us underneath the shade of the umbrell "
"the food and view are good, also the service is not bad, but the the food and drinks are overpriced."
"after a walk in the woods we liked to have drinks in lodge 7. the view is really beautiful and the place looks very nice. thats about it. as we entered the restaurant no one of the extensive staff was kind enough tot even say hello. after we find a table we waited for a waiter in vain. two different waiters came by the table next to us but never paid a second attention to us even after making eye contact. fed up being neglected, we left the place as we entered as we have never been there."
the restaurant is located in the center of vaa 
"basic, though quite authentic greek cuisine. lots of choice, and the portions were too much for us to finish. friendly staff. decoration is a bit basic and a bit kitch."
we have been here for a drink. its a touristic location but we liked the setting. the staff was very friendly.
the food was good but we found it very expensive. it is another tourist trap. the waiter was very polite and nice but we found people that came in after us got their food before we did and they came in a good amount of time after us
"the place was busy, but i dont understand why. ordered nasi and sate and my wife ordered a chicken nasi plate. hers was ok. my pork skewers were so tough i couldnt cut them with a knife. sent it back and didnt replace the order. had some of the chicken nasi instead. perhaps we should have stuck with traditional chinese dishes. disappointing."
"we dined and paid the bill. then, as we were leaving, we were accosted across the bar with the question whether we had paid and needed to show the receipt. pretty insulting. no apologies were offered."
we ate here with family. i ordered the salmon but without arugula (rucola). it came with arugula (they dont listen) and also a lukewarm potato cake that tasted like it was made 2 days ago and half warmed up. unimpressive.
we had nice burgers here on the first night of our holidays but did not go back. it was expensive for what it was sadly. lovely location and friendly staff.
"babble beach is a restaurant located on the veluwe meer beach of bad hoophuizen. it has a lovely terrace where you can enjoy drinks and snacks. inside is the restaurant. the ambiance is nice , the service is friendly and quick. the meals are ok"
weve eaten here a few times before but we became less and less interested in this restaurant as the experience is not worth the price and the place doesnt have enough character.
"nice place and terrace, great set-up, very good meats. poor service, slow and rude, maybe tired at the end of their morning shift."
"we had dinner here on a beautiful summer evening. as expected the wines were very good. the food somewhat mediocre and not always matching the quality of the wines. but we were mostly annoyed by the several flies in the restaurant, many were stuck on the ceiling, one death fly fell on our table. we had a good laugh about it but i does not suit the restaurant. "
"on base of our last great experience we visited the bistro of the salentein again but now it was a disappointment. it took too long we were being served. we ordered a good bottle of wine and a carafe water from the tap (like last time) but this time another waitress told us that it was strictly forbidden to serve (free) water from the tap. we had to ask for bread which came too late. the worst of all was the smoke from the open kitchen where steaks were to baking. the waitress had to open the outside door close to us to get rid of the smoke and of course the cold came in. the food was really ok but till today our cloches are smelling of those steaks!! last time it was great, this time it was the opposite. we dont know if there will be a third time. "
"it has nothing special to offer , except for a good restaurant . but overrated and no great cooking . only usefull for doing business , not for holidays."
"having grown up in this area, the salentein always had that magical ring of being out of reach of the common folk, due to its supposed exquisit cuisi "
"pancakes ok, quite expensive, lots of kids  playground indoors and outdoors perfect fir families with children. campsite restaurant atmosphere. nothing soecial on the menu, but good portions."
"visited here with a group of friends. the place packs 600 people, who are scattered over the place. once youre seated you dont notice that much, but when you want to get freshly prepared food at either the wok/teppanyaki or green egg station, youll have to stand in line. there are plenty of choices for either starters, main course and desserts, even out-of-the-ordinary things like crocodile, shark and kangaroo. because of the long lines i didnt even try these out and settled for the already finished dishes. the food is plenty, they keep bringing in fresh, but in my opinion its not spectacular. just goo "
"the location is great, right in the forest with sufficient parking space when arriving by car. children with definitely like it. this restaurant has expanded over the years. it now offers sufficient tables on their terrace during summer. i prefer winter time however when you can only sit inside with a cosy atmosphere and their experienced staff. unfortunately during the summer the staff expands, with not the right pro-active skills needed. they are kind once they are at your table however this takes too long. they are more working on entering the orders electronically than paying attention to new guests who arrive. i even noticed guests going inside to place their order at the regular crew. myself i had to collect my own menu as my very obvious signals were not paying attention to. i have been here many times, but this time it was really average. management, get your staff a bit more attentive towards guests and it will improve dramatically."
boshuis drie is a restaurant located in an old farmhouse not too far away from ermelo. the staff are friendly and the choice of meals is excellent.
"in the woods, location superb, cosy atmosphere, fits surroundings. friendly staff. dogs and horses welcome. apple cake oversized. a bit dusty."
"within the lovely woods (veluwe forest) stands this restaurant, converted from a barn, its got a nice space to sit outside. the coffee, berry pie, and apple pie were all lovely."
we came here for lunch once after walking through the bush and it was fantastic. very nice and lovely atmosphe 
located along the woods with a guaranteed supply of hungry day trippers with numbed sense of taste is not exactly an incentive to provide top-class dish 
the lunchen we had there was table served and elaborate. the staff was friendly and this restaurant is very busy.
"well, it is a beautiful place to begin with. but it was on the second of january. i dont know if it was a day no one wanted to work, but te service was abysmal. first of no one was smiling. as if they where working without pleasure. secondly, our table wasnt cleaned. and lastly, i ordered the same salade as my girlfriend, but i told them i was lactose intolerant. so when the salades came, they asked again, who had intolerance. i told me. unfortunately, they gave me the wrong salade. i ntice a couple white blobs, which must have been something with milk i thought. i asked again, and yes the said, that i had the one with lactose. thank god it was before i started. the salades cost €12, which is not very cheap, and if you look at what you get, it is not much. a couple of pieces salmon and lettuce. if you look at the ingredients it is nog more than €1,50. my girl got bread and butter also. i didnt get anything extra without lactose. when we asked the bill, i gave them feedback. i told them it isnt fair to charge me for the bread and butter, if i dont get anything instead and the salade was not very satisfying. she told us, we didnt expect it to be so crowdy and everything was sold out. and the salade was not a meal salade. i told her i do expect to be a little bit full with a salade for €12, but she couldnt take the feedback. too bad. so if you have an intolerance, i would not recommend them."
"great outdoor seating and fast friendly service on a sunny day. for lunch we had average toast with mushrooms, onions and cheese together with tasty weizen beer."
located in a small town in friesland right on a little river. this italian restaurant offers typical dishes like pasta and piz 
a fine italian restaurant. do not expect haute cuisine. but thats fine. just a no-nonsense italian restaurant. with surprising dishes and pizzas
"we ate here after a long day of travel.  dined on the special, which was a doner type meal not as good as doner joints."
"i chose this restaurant by chance and just from the look of it i expected some special asian food. very friendly staff, very modern and clean restaurant. „just“ the food did not meet my expectations. i have to admit that i am traveling to hong kong frequently and expect more than just european style convenience chinese food. it was ok, but had nothing to do with authentic chinese food. dim sum as a starter and spicy beef as main course. sorry.. not for me. once again, if you like to have a nice evening in a well decorated restaurant with a good service and „european“ chinese food this is a good place. "
"came here for too many times, apparently people in the area think that this is the best restaurant for chinese/ japanese cuisine. yet we experienced another disappointing day, this time we ate the teppanyaki. the beef and seafood tasted like frozen meat and they are definitely overpriced. they delivered the wrong dishes by mistake but waiter insisted that we must pay because we have eaten some of it and this was the order of the female owner. we always came with big group of family and expected good things since its always been recommended by family member, but we never tasted decent good food from the price that we paid for. never ever come here again!"
"i came with family. friendly staff but some order was not correctly made like my wonton soup came as a sweet and sour soup, some wine on the menu were not available... the beef and lobster were nice though but peking duck is very dry and overpriced, one of the worst peking duck ive ever had! i could make a better fu yung hai myself at home than theirs... i cannot remember the other dishes as they are very average (chicken, fried fish, etc)... they make this place as a fancy restaurant but they dont deliver the same quality of what you paid for."
"on arriving the bathroom smelt awful. the shower screen also allowed water to leak all over the floor. the room was dirty. ripped wallpaper, very dated & in need of reburshment. staff member ton i approached about this, was unhelpful. i cleaned the bathroom myself in the end. we were undecided about breakfast, so we went down to have a look at what was available. the lady didnt seem pleased that the two of us had turned up to eat, saying they might not have enough food if people just turned up. it does state on their site non guests can come in to eat. so how does a hotel not have enough food? my sister only ever eats toa "
my wife and i had an evening meal here on a monday. it was one of a few eateries open on mondays but was not full by any mea 
"good middle class hotel. very often dance and party in the backroom-no problem for guests. romoms rather small and not to new, but all is there. showgrössen was leaking, seems nobodys problem. stayed one week-showergel, tissues and so on was never stockt up, pity. staff friendly, breakfeast nice. "
"the staff was excellent and helpful. the cafe, lounge, bar was very enjoyable and looked updated. we enjoyed the option of a traditional dutch breakfast €12.50pp. the rooms need an ibisstyle update. rooms were older--but clean, not soundproof--heard neighbor snoring. the location allowed great access to local cuisine and bars. "
visited with a large group they provided a large room for us which looked a bit dated as did the rest of the hotel food was good !!
"i went here to eat lunch with my family. the restaurant looks really nice and cozy. unfortunately it was very cold inside, i even sat with my coat on during lunch. they have a kind of fireplace, but it is just for show, since it doesnt heat up the plac "
"we have been visiting hillegom for years, and this relatively new restaurant is one of several owned by the same people. it is a retro design, modeled on a nearby art deco building, which is pleasant. most of the dining was in an upstairs balcony, looking down over the salon or bar area. only part of the upstairs was open, and a good thing too as there was only one server for the entire place and she was extremely bu "

"first time visit. the overall atmosphere and setting, both inside as well as outside is very pretty and welcoming. very friendly service with a smile makes you feel at ease instantly. however an attempt has made to make it look exclusive, say a bit haute cuisine "
"we had dinner with a large group of adults and kids, 12 in total, and the place was quite busy for a sunday evening. main problem was that it took about 1,5 hours before we got our fodd, which is simply unacceptable for a place that targets kids. however, the kids were all happy with their pancakes, thats not the hardest part, but the adults mainly had other dishes and they were mediocre at best. sate sauce that was hard, salads with hardly anything in it and not much taste and prawns that were tasteless. a real pity as these arent hard things to make. the restaurant is situated in an old post office which is quite charming and the interior is straight forward which suits a place aimed at kids. overall a bit disappointing but i guess if its more quiet that they should be able to do a better job."
"i believe this restaurant also is owned by the same company as the one in hillegom? i couldnt get the address to leave a comment on the pijnacker establishment, so will do so here. i have eaten at the pijnacker restaurant several times on visits to that city. it never fails to come up with great food in such interesting surrounds. highly recommended for anyone, and especially families with small children."
"having only a single vegetarian main course does not make you “vegetarian friendly”. and the curry itself was not very tasteful neither, especially when compared to real indian cuisine. please, make a bit more effort in offering several choices."
"we had heard good recommendations about the food but were very disappointed by the very unfriendly almost rude manager on duty... i understand corona is a stressful situation especially for restaurants, but no need to be rude to customers... because of this behavior we decided to eat somewhere else (see my review of fletcher hotel schoorl restaurant). sorry for this review... we might try it again post corona... but for now i won‘t recommend this."
guess it was quiet here because of the off season timing. this place next to the beach would probably be packed at summer. quite costly but well prepared food. nice decorations and good variation on seating. cannot seat a big group together.
we were in the area & stopped in for lunch. we didnt have reservations so were asked to sit at the bar/counter. we ordered tomato soup & broccoli soup of the day along with some other simple items. we were surprised at how long it took to get our entrees. we all agreed that we have had better service & soups.
place is nice with the outdoor playground for the ki 
"we had all the good intentions to go there for lunch for s long time, so last week we decided to go there for a bite. not many people and the service was a bit slow but the food was good. we had no idea that the cheese sandwich was grilled or the ham for that matter. may that needs to be adjusted on the menu!"
we went here with two adults and five children for dinne 
really nice place in the middle of the nature. it is the perfect place to take a drink after an exploration with bikes. stuff friendly. internal cozy. big terrace outside.

- a limited choice menu-card.....1 for lunch & another for dinner. printed on paper and worn-o 
"the place has several functions. you have the restaurant inside, outside seating, diner, lunch, or only a cup of coffee coming of the heather. interior nice and cozy. service is slow and waitress was clumsy. didnt listen to what we said and had to ask again what we ordered.also her uniform was stained. they really need to look at the quality of their serv "
"tafelberg seriously needs to focus on their service. we were there last sunday on a nice sunny day. the terrace outside was full, so it was busy. this could not have been a surprise though as the weather was announced for a long tim "
place is nice. good terrace. service is a bit slow however. although it was reasonably busy it took 10 mins for a waitress to come and a further 15 mins for the coffee and appeltaart to arrive. both were good.
this place is really nice in nature where u can sit and relax. a great place for drinks or a snack. i would not really come here for a good meal as i find the food is nothing to write home about.
"relaxed place to sit. large, many tables. good for people watching in better weather. simple menu, easy dishes, kid friendly. value for money and friendly service. satey was good."
"this place is on the perfect spot next to the nature of the the blaricumerhei. you can start your hike here and usually there is enough free parking space. we are regular visitors here. the problem of this place is that the staff doesnt perform consistent. sometimes very good and fast sometimes they seem not to see you whatsoever. especially in the weekends it can be very busy with slow service. they food is decent, maybe a bit overpriced. the sauvignon house wine is recommended."
"food was lovely. but they could have done with more staff, it was busy and we had to wait ages before even getting our drinks. food was understandable but a drink while we wait wouldve been nice."
"delightful place bordering tafelberg which attracts a lot of people who like to walk and stop there for drinks, lunch, dinner or coffee. the interior is charming. the service can be slow. we got the odea that a lot of students work here.the food is tasty and there is a nice choice. the place is family and animal friendly. the views of tafelberg and nature are a plus to this place. they have a large terrace which is open during summer. an ideal place to sit in the summer."
"i took my little one to the tafelberg and had a nice sandwich. the best part about the restaurant is the location, next to a nice meadow for an afternoon walk. ive heard there are usually sheep in the meadow, unfortunately they were not there that day."
"having lived in nl for 5 years, weve grown accustomed to a degree of latitude where service is concerned but this was really disappointin "
"so you go on a sunny day for a walk and decide to stop at this restaurant because of the nice terrace. ordered food but were told by our waiter no changes were possible! food arrived, egg was cold, portion was minimal and the tosti was not what we ordered! waiter told us it is what it is!!! real "
"ordered a ceasar salad (€12.50) which was small and disappointing with two thin slices of smoked chicken on three leaves of romaine lettuce, slices of egg 3 olives and meagre grated cheese. the dish did not look attractive either. the waiter asked if i would like some bread and then brought two pieces of stok brood. my partner had spelt bread with a meat ball served with mustard and some small salad garnishes. the wine was ok but expensive."
nice restaurant for lunch or dinner. simple but good food. nice for a relaxed evening. always friendly.
"we were there on tuesday for lunch. it was nice weather and was not busy in any restaurants in that area. we noticed there were only the chef who also brought food to customers and the lady waiter, so long wait for the food and to pay. in term of food, the salmon wrap and spring rolls were nice. but buchetta had no taste, something was missing."
multiple people at the beach side of the restaurant walked out because of the extremely slow service.
"we had to wait for 30-60 minutes for a waiter/waitress. she was busy chatting with other customers and ignored our call.  with this kind of service, don’t even bother to come to this place.  yes, the table was untidy all the time."
"terrible service, we had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and the menu. the waiters were not paying any attention at all and were very slow."
i had lunch with my family here very recently. i think it is more attractive in the summer than the winter. the food was good and the service adequate. they must pride themselves in being dog friendly which is great - up to the point where some dogs take a disliking to one another and let all the others know it.
"nice place at the beach, with decent food and good service. not a standard scruffy beach restaurant of bar, but definately above."
"bought three takeaway meals here and they were tasteless. bought chicken satay - watery tasteless sauce and the chicken pieces were tasteless, also bought a chicken chow mein - this dish was also watery and tasteless, also bought gado gado ….. this was absolutely nothing like a decent meal - again a watery tasteless mess ! to accompany the dishes we bought a loempia….turned out to be a poor quality item from a frozen food compa "
"quick service but soggy gloopy noodles with nothing fresh about it, wouldnt recommend better than school dinners!"
"food is ok, fairly average dutch/ indonesian/ chinese that you get here, all cooked (or zapped) in about 5 seconds, all tastes the same as everywhere else but i quite like it especially if i’m hung "
"terrible food. charged me twice as much as the cost of what i ordered. i argued, but no help. the lo mein has green peppers in it which ive never seen in real chinese lo mein... the noodles were bland especially for 16 euro."
the dishes can be very good if you are specific about your wishes. the chicken with black bean sauce and szechwan shrimp are both good.  the owners speak good english so communicating goes well.

"we had made a reservation and arrived on time. it was a busy evening so had to wait a little before being seated. service was slow and it took almost 20 minutes before someone took our drinks order. unfortunately, service remained slow for the rest of the evening. we felt as if we had been forgotten as nobody came to check if everything was okay - we did see the waitresses asking everyone else. some waitresses finished their shifts whilst the restaurant was still full - seemed a little odd to  "

fabulous food but sooo expensive we had a takeaway and the portions were large but paid £65 for four dishes 😳😳😳
"we ate siu la ngau lau sie and  kon po ngau pin  . it looked colourful and nice. but only the vegetables tasted good. the meat was tasteless, unrecognisable. we doubted if it really was tenderloin. what a pity. the only thing i can recommend are the baked bananas. staff was indifferent."
went there a couple of nights back with my wi 
"beautiful place with big playground. however the menu is limited and the staff is generally unhelpful. the menu is mainly pancakes and pizzas, yet both seem flavorless and unbalanced in dough and ingredients."
"initially, i just went to have a coffee but then i saw advertised on the menu homemade focaccia cooked in their own oven. what i received was nothing like focaccia, but a big stale piece of bread. a truly big bland sandwich that i could hardly cut into. i took one bite and no more as it had the odour and taste of staleness. to top it off, the waiter leaned over the table breathing over my sandwich, as he insisted that it was baked that morning. no sense of social distancing here. i noticed that they didnt wipe the table either. absolutely no recompense. they could have offered the coffee. never again."
worst service ever. long wait 40min to get food. waiters were not helpful and almost rude. i will not come back.
"tbh worst experience, the service was horrible. we where seated at a dirrty table which didn’t get clean the table not even when she took our orders. super rude, 4 people working on the floor, none came to help us. took them 30 minutes to come and take our food order with only 3 table "
"asked for a tuna salad, which included eggs and anchioves... first time i got just the salad... then i sent it back...they came back second time with the tuna, but without the eggs and anchioves, sent it back second time...finally got it right.. salad was also tasteless... really ridicolous... never again!"
"mid morning, not packed, 5 staff standing inside with their backs towards customers. well trained people, well trained! coffee took ages and was cold and when paying the bill they looked grumpy as no tip was addedd. go figure sherlocks!"
"visited on new years day. you can’t book so got down there at 11am, coffee was grim and as my nephew and niece only drink water we asked for a jug of tap water and was refused. we had to buy their bottled water with their logo on it. one waitress was hideous, hit me in the head with her tray as she leaned to pick up cups. slammed our food down. we were a table of 7 and our meal arrived in two halves, so 4 people ate while we watched - not a pleasant experience - they need to step up their game "
"a good place to go to for big pancakes and pizzas.it is a well known restaurant in a monumentel house .large tables,which can host whole families.also dogs are welcome.the prices are ok but the service could be friendlier."
we rang to reserve a table for 6 people but were told that no reservations were possible here. so some of our party arrived early and waited patiently for a larger table to come free which eventually it did. this place was teeming - mostly with families with young kids. presumably the formula of offering a menu based mainly on pizzas and pancakes and having a large playground at the back of the premises helps in this respect. certainly the two year old in our party really loved skipping round the playground and even found time to eat some of her pizz 
food is ok service slow but worse thing is people bringing thier dogs in .animals eat outside when we asked to move was a major problem
"tasty pancakes and waffles.  however i do not recommend waffles with ice cream and fruits.   coffee was ok, but not the best ever ;)"
"heart warming for parents and exciting for kids - here you get reasonably priced, easy to sell to kids type of food - pizza, pancakes, lasagne! : "
"went there yesterday with my wife for brunch -served only after 12 am-. the place is very welcoming, with the kitchen in the middle of the dining room. the big windows make you feel youre in the middle of the woods and the dunes. we both ordered pancakes. i found my pancake too thick, too soft, sort of not cooked enough. i prefer a pancake with a bit of crispy in it. next time ill try something different on their menu!"

fishsoup with three little pieces of fish plus water. even water seems to be expensive if we look at the soup. a paling sandwich where you need magnifiying glasses to find the fish and with no love prepared. dirty beer glasses and on top poor service. i visited the place twice but never again. even the nice view does not compensate for what you get!
"when i dined at waddengenot aan zee just a week ago, i clearly told the waitress that i had a milk allergy. she said she would check with the chef and everything seemed to be okay. the food we got was delicious, but i noticed after only a few bites of my starter that i was starting to get nauseous. not able to finish even half of my dinner, i left the restaurant feeling very sick. the food tasted great, but i think it very bad that the restaurant did not take care to avoid using milk in my dishes. i called the day after to tell them about this misfortune, but no compensation was offered."
"not for the first time that we were here but it seems that the business has been taken over or, at least, the name has chang "
"there is nothing really to it. a great view, ideal if you are early for the boat to schiermonnikoog and hungry. they do know how to make the traditional fish dishes and they serve oysters. staff is young and perhaps somewhat inexperienced bit very friendly. kitchen takes its time. "
relative small and simple choice in menus.... service friendly but not fast.. desserts and coffee are excelent. price quality a bit off
"people can use a buffet to get their raw meat and fish to grill at the table. quality of the food is average. the salad was somewhat soggy already and the steak has obviously been there, judging the level of stains from being exposed to open air. what would one expect if you pick this type of restaurant? i can understand that this is something that is virtually unavoidable, unless you would present each table a dish up front, that serves the amount of people that was reserved f "
"it‘s a fastfood restaurant. decent seating outside. definitely the cheapest alternative in the area. food is ok, but nothing special. just a place for a quick bit for reasonable prices"
had a quick bite to eat at the restaura 
"the food was fine, and very big portions, had a starter, main course and a dessert. the starter and dessert were quite good. but the main course put quantity over quality.   the service was a little bit weird at moments, mostly inexperienced."

"we missed to reserve a table at one of the beach restaurants so we went to billy bob. the place was crowded so we waited for 1,5 hours to get 1 steak, 2 spare ribs and 2 burgers. thats was no problem. when they served the food only the steak was hot - really everything else was cold. literally cold. we told them its cold and wheter they could warm it up. they did it without saying sorry. we felt like bad guests. we ordered, because we were hungry, another cup of fries and some drinks. we just had a little cup of salad and one and a half cups of fries for everyone! everyone had to get fries and a salad - ist was written in the menu. it wasnt like that. when we get our food the second time. it was cold aga "
monopoly? not used to public? not flexible enough to adapt to good weather? anyhow: more than 1 hour waiting for very regular food is really too much.  improve your communication skills please..... always the same when you place your order with electronic devices....
"my family has visited julianadorp almost every year since the early 70ies, and i myself have been there almost every summer for 25 years. as long as i can think, there used to be a really nice, cozy and somewhat retro restaurant at the strandslag de zandloper: the schip of tstrand, gaining its name from an old, stranded ship which had been converted into a restaurant some decades ago, later replaced with a more pragmatic, seamans style shack on wooden pol "
"as most customers are either dutch or german, there is no information in english, which makes the ordering challenging for those that rely on english. we were a group of nine. those that ordered pancakes were for the most part satisfied. the rest of us not so much. there are other restaurants nearby, of which i can at least recommend the italian one. to say something positive, the website is well designed and there is a playground outside."
"dont quite get the concept of italian tapas. italian food is wholesome, its filling and plentiful. if youre hungry the small platters and having to order from a limited menu will frustrate you. oh and you have to write down your order and hand it to the waitress...🙄"
"stopped for a quick bite. had a set menu to choose from as we were on a tour. chose the cheese sandwich, and it wasn’t bad. very plain, and came with no sides. waiter was decent and friendly. also had a chocolate cookie. not bad for roadside - truck stop - type food."
"food quality was poor. rice with the pokébowl was served as one big sticky bal. after feedback to the kitchen no excuse, nor any compensation was offered."
"we went with friends to grab a drink at the bar or one of the empty tables. however, we were rudely informed that the restaurant was full, and the empty tables would be occupied shortly. strangely, in the next half hour, the place became even emptier than when we arrived. the overall atmosphere of the shop felt unwelcoming."
we were visiting this place to have a drink some friends the restaurant had to empty bars and we ask to seat for a short drink we were really surprised with the rudeness and their behavior. they told us that was completely full but with a very bad way. we went to another place and after few minutes that we went to see it was even more empty. i really don’t understand why we were not welcome at all there and why they threw us away with such a bad behavior. never again. the worst personnel i ever found before
"a short time ago i went here for a business dinner, the place was recommended by another restaurant to us. for us it was really a let down, service was mediocre just as the food. maybe next time we are in the netherlands we give it a try again."
"food not too bad, but when we were not sure if we should order dessert or not, their reaction in dutch was not very polite - they just didnt realise we understood the lingo! too bad we did..."
"located in the town center this place offers nice seating right next to the sidewalk, nice to watch the world go by. service was friendly and helpful. long menu of all sorts of pancake delights. we tried the grand mariner and cinnamon & apple pancakes which tasted pretty good. if you like pancakes then this is the place to come to. not cheap though considering a pancake can be up to €10! with drinks and one pancake each expect to spend €50 upwards for a family of four. coffee was average in taste. "
"we paused here for coffee.  it was served quickly, with friendly welcoming service.  the coffee was rather weak though. reasonably priced. would have liked to be able to stay for lunch"
"we had a lunch in this old house restaurant, and all was fine, not spectacular but good food in a big portion."
we only had a coffee here as we were told there was nothing else available before 11am. there was no deca and not much choice in tea. when i went inside to pay i had to wait for 10 minutes at the till as the waiter was busy with other things and addressed me in a rather rude w 
"i had lunch with my husband at de platte hap today. the food wasnt great, and the service was poor. however the worse part happened when we got the bill. we had ordered mineral water with gas (met gas) but a carafe of still table water turned up, along with the carafe of wine we had ordered. on the bill it stated that we had a bottle of water (not a carafe) and the charge was 5€ (the wine only cost 10€). i queried the cost of the water and asked to see the price on the menu. the waitress who was taking payment suddenly lost her ability to speak english and was unable to show me the price on the menu - no surprise there. what a shame places like this exist to rip off customers."
"only had some drinks. staff was unfriendly and not welcoming. still gave tips, the change wasnt right. didnt try the food, though.."
"located in a picturesque area, the inside is cute and there are tables outside front and back. the menu is fairly extensive, especially for pancakes, but also a good selection of other savory items. all the prices are reasonable. overall, nothing special but adequate if youre looking for some lunch in ouddorp."
"went here numerous times over the years and this time stopped for drinks and dinner. when we said we preferred not to leave our details (re. corona measures) the lady, as she delivered our drinks, turned quite hostile and snapped that she could refuse u "
"we followed the good rating and had dinner at the pot. i guess for dutch (low) standards it was okay. it was hard to get a reservation. the staff kept telling us they had now tables available for a week. when we got there, tables outside were available and still we got told that no table was available. so we asked explicitly for one of the tables and they told us that we could sit their but at our own risk, because it would rain soon. we took the risk and never got wet. the food is nothing special. the taps are medium quality at best and the pizza for our kids came straight from the freezer. we wouldn’t go there again. "
it was a poor meal we got served. the pita bread we had to roll by ourselves. the meat was not baked medium but rare. and i got a disgestion the morning after what only can be the cause of the diner the night before.
the food was very nice but the place is very old fashioned and dark.  the service was fine  good choice of lunch time things on offer at very reasonable price  would be lovely in good weather as lots of outside seating
"this is what you expect if you order an uitsmijter in a traditional bruin café. i would argue that the quality of this dish is quite predictable in the netherlands: fresh, good taste, nothing fancy. i must say, in most restaurants you get 3 slices of bread with 3 fried eggs (sunny side). here i got 2 of both which was kind of a disappointment. maybe it was because i ordered a combo with a so "
still a very nice concept where you can have a taste of various dishes. sad to admit though but food quality is declining.
"all in all its a good place to eat, make sure to make a reservation because they tend to be packed. the menu is diverse, but a lot of it is not necessarily cooked to order (which would be impossible in the fast paced tapas environment that they offer) but that left our chicken, pork and even donut to be dry. but most of the food is good. parking can be difficult, and the toilets dont say if they are in use or not, but the staff is young and active. good place to go with a group of people who like to eat."
i have been here 2 times already. mostly very bus 
this restaurant is unusually located in a former train station building next to the disused railway line (now a cycle path) which operated between turnhout and tilburg. the restaurant has been nicely renovated and now has quite a modern interior with plenty of space and comfortable seati 
"decent food, freshly made, drinks included. loads of choice. good place to eat with a group of friends."
"the food was absolutely fabulous, but the staff are just rude and unfriendly; no idea how to be good hosts; its a shame as it takes away from the excellent food thats being served; will not be going back because of the staff"
"kind of alright pancakes, but nothing special from other places.  we went there a saturday night where they already closed at 20, which we through was early for a weekend evening. but the food was good"
"if you like pancakes, then you can find some very unusual ones on the menu here, but unfortunately like other reviewers have expressed, it is nothing special compared to other dutch pancake restaurants. some of the special flavour combinations can also be a bit ‘too much’. pick one of the more ‘traditional’ dutch choices and you should be alrig "
"very long waiting time, food was nothing special. we all ordered different food but all tasted the same. the restaurant is nice tough."
was in baarle nassau/baarle hertog on a warm evening and found this restaurant in the center of to 
"five employees were taking to each other at the bar, yet no one really seemed to notice i was there. the food tasted good, but seemed a bit wee for the money (€6,25)."
setting is lovely and staff are friendly and professional. but the food promises more than it delivers. homemade lemonade wasnt and a caesar salad had no chicken at all and a very anchovy heavy mayonnaise dressing. its a shame as the potential is huge. maybe we caught them on an off day? 
"as you might expect from the restaurant you have a beautiful view over the fields. the interior of the restaurant is also ok. we had a three course surprise menu. before we started the asked us if we had some allergies. after some good bread we had a bland mushroom soup. our main course of salmon was ok but is was it was too little to make our hunger disappear. although my wife had clearly indicated that she was allergic to nuts, we received a dessert with nuts. unfortunately they told this after we had eaten it. we would not go here again."
"based on reviews and the positioning of the restaurant, we had good expectations. unfortunate none was real. except foor some parts most dishes were not to our liking and quite dry. no nice wines accompanying the dishes, for every dish the same. service was ok-ish"
"in the town centre, and has indoor and outdoor eating. the tosti and tacos we had were basic and average, with no accompaniments one might expect. inside is a bit dark and dreary. cant say id rush back."
"had dinner at het heerenlogement with a couple of ex colleagues. upon arrival, the fireplace was burning and there was a cosy atmosphere. they have a nice menu with a couple of good dishes, however, it was somewhat unfortunate not everything was available. the wine list was okay, albeit they didnt have a pinot gris which is a quite common wine to serve. prices for the food were decent; for the wine i found prices somewhat elevated. all in all it was a good dinner."
we always enjoy the atmosphere there but food has become very disappointing and expensive for the bad quality. we might go there for a beer and the atmosphere but won’t eat there again!
"my very first chinese restaurant in the netherlands and the first impression is good. the food was quite decent and tasted authentic, given that ive been to many restaurants in hong kong and taiwan. the restaurant itself is quite big but was relatively empty during the day. mind you, it was quite a cold day with ice on the road, which might explain it. the lighting in the restaurant is a dim so i found it slightly difficult to see the food clearly. adding a lazy susan to the table wouldve made sharing the dishes much easier. otherwise, the food tasted quite authentic."
"going to a chinese restaurant or getting chinese food from the take-away, which is almost always attached to the restaurant is sort of a habit in the netherlands. free parking is also nice with the colossal hourly rates in the city center parking facilities. that is why i try from time to time chinese restaurants in the suburbs to find the kind of chinese restaurant i will gladly return to. however, chinese restaurant rose garden was no revelation. granted, parking was free in the street and the staff was welcoming and polite, albeit a bit slow. the restaurant is clean and light, but a discordant was the slot machine in full view, complete with gamblers. furthermore, a table at the window means a view of a filling station and the multilevel car park next to the spaland shopping center. the food was obviously prepared with dedication, but, in my opinion, too much cooking oil was used for the preparation. i must admit that i am spoiled through my numerous visit to malaysia, but i cant write an enthusiastic review about the food served at the rose garden. it is average at best. so i am still searching for that special chinese restaurant, where you can say when the thought strikes you: lets go tonight."

"it’s a typical indian restaurant with a rich selection of dishes and a set menu at a low price. the service is very slow and something gets missed in the way. the food is abundant, not memorable but not bad."
"the location is great when you can sit outside. there is a cute playground on grass where kids can play while waiting. the food was alright, but nothing special. the service was very bad: they aren’t attentive while walking around so we ended up going inside to order. the chef wasn’t friendly. the boys bringing out the food couldn’t answer the simplest questions about when certain food could be ordered and instead of asking a colleague to help they’d just say “i am the wrong person to ask”. "
"being easily accessible for us (being locals) we go here sometimes if we dont feel like cooking. the menu stays the same with small variations. the choice is ok but not the widest. the kids usually resort to the pancakes but liked the tomato soup as well. burgers are tasty. the fries are not my favorite but still not bad. we had mussles which were good, but other dishes are not served out the warmest. so on occasion we receive a cooled down dish. reheating the meal is straight away a turn off for m "

"after checking tripadvisor i thought it was going to be better, but, at least what we had was regular precooked food, heated again in the oven or microwave. the service was good and the seating area nice and comfortable."
"we went here with family as a post christmas treat. decor and atmosphere of restaurant really nice, but service was terrible. we had to wait over 1.5 hours to be served any food. it was a full house but only 3 waiters which was clearly not adequate. one of our party highlighted at the start of the night that they had a nut allergy but yet a complementary snack was served clearly had nuts in it which caused a reaction,thankfully it didnt escalate to anything serious. salad and baked potato were supposed to accompany 2 of the dishes but never arrived. plates were cold! we explained all of this to the waiter and honestly would have expected some good will gesture, either not charge the coffee or dessert or something but nothing was forthcoming. so although the quality of the food was good when it finally arrived. the poor service overshadowed the experience. we wont be back. "
"we made reservations ahead for 5.30 pm. when we arrived we soon got the menu and choose a soup and main course. soup arrived within 15 minutes, after that we had to wait for more than 2 hours; well never know how our maincourse would have tasted. after an hour and a 45 minutes we asked how much longer it would take. the waitress told us within 8 minutes. we left after waiting for 2 hours! another couple left just before us and a couple left with us, for the same reason. very bad!"
"located outside the village waalre, the t brabants genot is a typical old farm that has been transformed into a restauran "
"our british visitors with small children wanted to try dutch pancakes and the kids wanted to play. so t brabants genot was the only choice. seating on benches in the sun was ok for most, although we could have sat in shadow or even indoors. it was at one stage difficult to attract the attention of staff (it was a busy sunday) but once contact was made things moved along swiftly. the pancakes were excellent and there was a good selection of unusual beers and wines. a good time was had by all!"
it took like 30 minutes for the waitress to collect an order. and its not even busy... quite sad cause location is nice.
we were a group. the service was very slow. our meals came out wrong. the dishes was just average. it is nice to sit outside and it is a nice neighbourhood.
small restaurant for lunches in the shopping center den hof in waalre. the interior is a little bit cold and the place noisy due to bad acoustics. the food is not bad but a bit overpriced. service is ok.
"pleasantly surprised by my local brasserie. nice food, good size portions, friendly staff, fair price. atmosphere was fine, staff was polite and clearly local, it was not so busy when we were there."
"outside seating is nice, inside a bit cold. quality of the lunch is good, service good too. just fine for a quick lunch."
i say better than average and it was but theres room for improvement he 
"my family ate at this restaurant on monday, july 25th and enjoyed two free jugs of iced water with a delicious meal . on friday, july 29th we returned for a meal and was told that they serve no water in jugs - we had to pay € 15.00 for six small bottles of water . an absolute disgrace. the food may be nice , but theres definitely something rotten about this experience!"
"nothing fancy, but it does the trick to have a nice meal or just a toasted ham-cheese sandwich from a simple menu. in summer the icecream gives this place an extra (cool) touch. the name is funny too. it is expreszo, which loosely translates into on purpose this way, but of course it is pronounced as espresso, the strong small italian coffee. sitting outside on the kerkbrink is always a nice experience, weather permitting."
visited with my wife for lunch menu was very limited at lunchtimes ordered steak with onions a mushrooms when it came there was no mushrooms they had run out wont rush back !!
"the small town of son en breugel, just north of eindhoven, is home to a growing number of restaurants. about a year ago this one opened on a splendid location: the small harbour for yachts at the wilhelmina kanaal. its a huge success and this has a serious downside. there does not seem to be sufficient staff to serve all customers at once. we waited forever, at least one hour for the starter and then another hour for the main course. by that time we were cold and annoyed. of course we had already finished our wine and had to order another bottle. the food itself is supposed to be simple but not very refined: what are red onion rings doing on a carpaccio? all in all not a place i would recommend. instead go for one of the many alternatives in town: de sonnerie, klein geluck, brasserie etc."
my lunch was spoilt by being made on old dry bread.i expect to have fresh ingredients in my meal.it was a pity.
"the location of this little restaurant is perfect; in the middle of a green area, close to the parking and with some activities such as a miniature golf track next door. the staff is super friendly, well trained and truly taking care of the guests. the food served however is not on par with the staff; it’s just average food whereas the prices are too high for average...."
the sad thing about this place is that they always close early. for example when it clearly says they close at 6pm we have been turned away various times at 520pm and 530pm. i understand that the staff want to go home but why have closing times if they arent stuck  
"after visiting the branche café in amersfoort which served perfect sandwiches, we decided to try this location as wel "
delivery was extremely late and no timely updates!   hard to get in touch with customer service.  would not recommend
"the restaurant looks nice and welcoming, but dont be fooled.the quality of the food is not in relation to the price. we picked up an average meal for 6 people which cost almost twice as much as the nearby toko (where the food is tastier and more authentic). this was my second and last time at pasar makan: i was very disappointed."
over priced over rated and poor value for money. i feel i have wasted €45 the food was not good could hardly distinguish between between slop on my plate.  all sauce very little meat.
"i was told its a good t restaurant but the good was rather disappointing. went there with hubby and 3,5 year old daughter on my birthday and were not so excited. it all tasted quite the same. we couldnt recognize the ingredients and flavors. as if everything was from the same pot. food not so kids friendly, unless youve trained your kid for such tastes. we never revisited."
"the nan (bread) they bring you at the beginning is great. the main courses had the same tomato-based sauce, only the one was sweet and the other wasnt. the girl that waited us was just adorable and super friendly. if id go back it would be for her hospitality and to try something else to prove me wrong."
ive never experienced so rude persons. its also far from city center and small portions and if you want more: not possible. this is a restaurant you should definitely not visit.
"sometimes come here with colleagues; food and service are up to standards; wide range of choice available. interior is a bit lackluster, but all in all a decent place to have a meal! not too expensive either."
"this is a typical chinese restaurant with the traditional dishes. the service is fast and efficient. the food is good, but nothing special. portions are big enough to share, or have it boxed for the other day."
i went there with my partner. the choice was limited. the food grossly overpriced for a run down old and cheap furniture decorated dump like this. it will cost you little less than 80€ for two without wine. their house wine is plonk of the worst sort and expensive. the service is deplorable and sl 
"i paid €35,75 for this peace of dump! these guys are thiefs!!!! this is what you get, apparently the owner thinks this is normal! please get out of restaurant business!!!"
"an indian place which doesnt have good vegetable dishes (with fresh ingredients) is really disappointing; my mushroom dish was made with mushroom from the can and the vegetable jalfrezi was not tasting good...indeed the choice for meateaters is better and my company liked their tandoori, but as a big fan of indian cuisine i was disappointed."
"we have been here twice and the first experience was great all round. the 2nd time we came it was busier. i immediately be came clear that everything was about money. they had placed multiple tables practically touching each other in order to fit more customers, even though the restaurant was not completely full. they also force us to order 2 main curry meals as apposed to one main, to share, along with a mix of different starters, breads and other options (this is what we did on our first visit) furthermore they then refused to serve tap-water, even after we had already ordered other drinks. this attitude completely ruined the experience for us and we will not go back again."
"the title speaks for itself, such a horrible experience. the hotel owner did not even had the courtesy to do damage control in any sense! not worth explaining or writing more about my/our dining."
selling what looks like standard factory bread for a premium. ignorant service from local schoolgirls. theres much better places around.
i like the bread variety from this bakery.. the nuts bread is my fave.. its healthy and fulfilling.. good for us hard working people.. only the service is always not so nice (but they are dutch women so what can i espect?) now i just come in. choose my bread. pay. leav 
i visit this location for many yea 
"we visit jeroen at least 3 times a year. simply because it’s close by so when you got some interest in icecream this is one of the few places to go to. however, i’ve had much better ice cream before. i would say quality is okay, but i’d rather buy ice cream in the lidl or ah. those taste almost the same, so i’d like them better"
"pizza was nice, thin and crispy. but seafood spagetti was not fresh and too much garlic, not to my like."

"this restaurant has always been a favorite with tasty, authentic dishe "
"this restaurant, situated in the heart of charming, water-rich maassluis, operates under a french name, monsieur paul. however, they offer a typical english dish, high tea. this high tea consists of tea in several flavours, sandwiches and as piece de resistance, an etagere with a variety of sweet food, pastries, scones, chocolates, you immediately associate with england. so far so good. the tea tasted good and the food was of good quality. however, i will never get used to the ambiance and service in dutch restaurants. the tables were so small that there was barely room for the etagere, teapot and two cups. furthermore, the tables were so close together that i had to be careful not to swipe my neighbours teacup from his table. and the service of the staff. the dutch are not so good in making customers welcome, compared to staff in other countries. oh, the waitresses were friendly, but serving customers is a profession, even an art and, what i remarked, the dutch havent mastered this yet."
a bit boring. mainly meat and french fries. i would choose the chicken stew with vegetables. friendly staff
"had to try but..... food wasnt ok, even wrong plate, bad service. as their are a lot of good places to go to in maassluis, they really have to make alterations to survive!"
"we ate here with a group of 9 people (incl. children). overall the food had good flavors and was prepared nicely. the place was very crowded and i found it too crowded. tables are packed in as much as they can, which is an effective use of space. but it does mean you have to be careful when moving out of your seat and wiggle past othe "

"cucina elena is located in vleuten, very close to vleuten train station. this is not a place for tourists but for locals who are either regulars or candidates to be regulars. we arrived at cucina at 17:35-17.40 and ordered 2 pizzas. we got our pizzas at 18:00. for a place which only has 4 tables inside (1 of them was empty when we ordered), this is really really long. the place is quite small so on a cold day, it might be chaotic with all the people who wait inside and there is no place to move, also for the staff. we arrived home and the pizzas are already got half-cold (we traveled by car for 6 minutes) . the crust around the pizza was so hard it was breaking and hurting your mouth when you bite. last but not least, according to the quattro formaggi description, i was expecting to taste gorgonzola which i did not at all. actually all i could taste was simple cheese "

"after a walk, we sat down in this restaurant for a drink. the waiters were very young and inexperienced but tried very hard. the drinks were poor (wine, beer). the snacks were ok. the restaurant has a nice setting and decor but was packed with families, so having a relaxing drink was out of the question.."
"personnel is rude and very unwelcoming. i went cycling and forgot water at home so stopped here for a snack and to drink some water. the waiter was not very helpful and basically told me to find myself a table outside (it was completely empty inside, but apparently not possible to find a spot for one person) i sat outside, a very rude young female waitress came and took my order refusing to speak english even when it was clear that i could not speak dutch. i finally got my cache and the water. i paid wuivkly because i did not want to be there much longer and she grabbed my half full glass of water that i wanted to drink yo make space for next customers. i had to grab my glass and tell her i was not finished. she left the glass and proceeded to seat a family of 4 people at my table while i was still sitting and finishing my water. i usually don’t complain about service in restaurant but this was just a bit too much! really unacceptable behavior. don’t go there unless you are dutch and very blond."
"26th dec, lunch with 11 persons. the food was not good. i would not recommend eating here. food was so bad i did not even bother to take any pictures. very dissatisfied with the food. the staff however was very friendly. the service of a tuktuk’ was the best experience. "
"3 euro for 200 ml of ice tea. though the exterior is nice. food is only ok. service as well, below average. they were busy and took us some time till our order was filled."

"anafora is situated in the maximapark and its location is wonderful for an afternoon of relaxing or going out with the kids as they have a large play yard next to the restaurant. the service is lacking customer focus though and the food is not more than ok. if you are looking for a place to drink i would recommend this restaurant, otherwise there are other restaurants in the vicinity that have better food."

"this is a wonderful place to take a break from a bike ride. the restaurant has an outdoor terrace with service adjacent to the main building. in the back, across a narrow lane and right on the water is a simple dock over the river angstel, with seating and self service - you place your order at a window and are called when it is ready for pick-up. no frills, but the views over the meadows cant be beat."
"fish mixed platter was all.frozen breadcrumed food. nothing fresh. 65 euro for a handful of deep fried snacks from the wholesalers. found part of plastic bag in our cole slaw. call the staff, never even apologized or offered some form of service. just that she would show the chef. took the salad away and never replaced it. mixed grill platter was a disaster, dry met, reheated giros, very tough lam chop. baklava supposed to be greek signature dish. was not made fresh but store bought and of very poor quality. very disappointing experience. this place has been there too long, decor is 45 years old and so is their menu. staff tired and not interested. dont go there."
close to hotel carlton in walking distane. food compared what you get is expensive. taste okay but nothing special.

"was staying at the carlton president in utrecht for a trade show and wandered down to this restaurant one evening.  decor was nice, but food was average and pricey.  a single noodle dish was the equivalent of us $19.00."
pancakes turned up looking like pizzas. they were flat not rolled up. salt and pepper definitely needed.. a nice alternative but prefer french crepes any day.
just a normal pancake restaurant. tried the pancake pizza and it tasted like it was made in the microwave (not sure if it was because of the different dough than normal pizza). service is good but they forget that you asked about the bill or that you want to pay it. however it does have a good view and it is friendly for kids and families.
"after a bad experience at tante liens some years ago, i visited this indonesian restaurant again with a friend because i remembered the food as good...just the service as lou "
"the starters were really nice, freshly baked bread, nice carpaccio and salad "
"i was told by our amsterdam guide this was a lovely place to grab lunch before going to dam square. it was really close to our hotel and not far from central station for the tram. according to american standards, i was mis-led a bit. the menu was small; the restaurant was small and when the place is full you have to share a table with some one else. there were 3 ladies in the restaurant-all 3 of them cooked, waited tables and bused the tables too. we got a waitress who spoke very poor english. my husband got the chicken sandwich which was on a good hoagie bun and quite tasty. i got what i thought was a hamburger, but it turned out to be an boiled egg sandwich with lots of different kinds of pesto sauce on each side of the bun. when i asked her if this is what i had ordered, the server got very offensive and rather rude and upset at me. the taste of the sandwich was okay, but i sure wouldnt order it again if i knew what i was ordering. it was raining and cold so we could not sit outside for lunch. there is lots of excitement as this restaurant is close to a busy street; bike paths and a small shopping district. it was a good experience but i would not recommend this place even for a quick lunch. the highlight of my lunch was walking in and hearing my favorite song --waiting for love by avicci playing on their radio. i felt like my dining experience went down hill when i questioned the sandwich i had ordered."
"very fine grand cafe. prices in relation to other grand cafes are on the upper side of the scale. however they serve a great steak, french fries are okay. service with bigger group is a bit complicated, but for a couple probably very efficient."
we arrived hungry and had to wait 15 minutes to get any attention in a restaurant with only 3 tables ful 
"we just had a quite drink here before visiting the castle. the place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. the staff is friendly but it is an understatement to say that the so-called espresso is really underwhelming. if you want a decent coffee, better to have it in the castle itself."
"right in front of the castle cannenburch in vaassen the location of this restaurant is amazing! the food is good, the staff is young and seems inexperienced."
"but not only an untold selection of pancakes is on the menu, but also baguettes, omelettes and deep fried food. eethuisje de heuveltjes is located just outside voorthuizen in de direction of apeldoorn. it is a wooden structure with some tables inside, but also an outdoor seating area, with a choice of tables. a childrens playground is also provided for. it is a nice stop in the woods when rambling around voorthuizen. free parking along the main road or some distance up the side road. reasonable prices and polite service. closed in the winter."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes just outside voorthuizen on the apeldoorn road is a trusted stop for a quick lunch. beside french fries and fried eggs, also baguettes and pan cakes are offered. prices are moderate. the restaurant is very suitable for families with (small) children; beside the childrens delight, pan cakes, an outdoor play ground is attached to the restaurant. prices are moderate and as bonus draft warsteiner beer can be had."
"eethuisje de heuveltjes is a nice establishment to stop for a quick bite if the restaurant is on the route. from time to time in the past years we had occasion to sit down there. every time we detected an improvement or an expansion; from a small wooden pan cake hut with three tables, eethuisje de heuveltjes has expanded over the years to a neat small restaurant with about ten tables, also a possibility to sit outside, and a small childrens playground. parking is possible along the apeldoornsestraat or in a small parking lot in the wood behind the restaurant. also the menu has become more extensive with plate service, however, pan cakes are still the core business. i still find it strange, that part of the menu, in particular the fried eggs plates and baguettes are served only till 17.00 hrs. i hear that the pan cakes are ok, but the fried egg plate is mediocre at best. to cheer things up: draft warsteiner is available. conclusion: a nice stop for a quick lunch if voorhuizen is on the route, by car or by bike, but not worth a detour."
"eatery de heuveltjes is a wooden structure off the apeldoornse straat in the woods just outside voorthuizen, in the direction of apeldoorn. the restaurant is located in a nice leafy surrounding with a possibility for sitting outside (with clement weather); as the room in the wooden structure is limited (5 tables), also a large tent is pitched to accommodate more tables. the restaurant seems to cater for day recreation tourists, as pancakes occupy a large portion of the menu. also omelets and french fries are served. the choice is limited, but for a stopover on a nice day it is sufficient. by the way, warsteiner beer on tap is served also. if you are in the vicinity of voorthuizen, on bike maybe, de heuveltjes is a nice stop for a snack."
"lounge3 offers good coffee and cake, friendly service and a nice sit-down in the outside seating area. inside the cafe is spacious. prices are reasonable. on our request the irritating thumping music was turned down so we could enjoy our coffee and cake in a quiet atmosphere while watching voorthuizen street li "
it took the waiter a long time to arrive at our table to take our ord 
"you take an old barge from pretty much the middle of nowhere in ijburg and reach your destination in about 30mn. then you are given a tour of the fort (in dutch only). dinner is served as a buffet with a fish stand and a meat stand. you have to fight a bit for a table and the food is average at best. dessert and coffee are also on a self serving basis and either are not memorable. in a nutshell, the concept is great but the execution lacks in quality for the price you pay."
nice coffee on the terrace! nice location! service very friendly. did not try the cake or lunch... maybe next time!!
the crepe was way too thick and the middle of the crepe tasted like eg 
"a short visit to have a drink, ordenairy place, serves food as well and one can play darts here. service rather slow."
this place looks nice and it was busy.   we went in for dessert and coffee. the coffee was nice but the dessert selection was limited and more on the average side.   i’d have coffee again but i’d leave the cake!
they didnt approach us. we asked many times if we can order. we never got to order. people who arrived later than us got to order and thats why we left.
the decor is very very cut 
i have been at lekkerr several times now. i have eaten several dishes from the menu.they serve good food and the service is good as well. the restaurant looks good too. it can be noisy though when crowded. next to that i have never been really impressed by the variety of the menu and the quality. its good but not more then that.
this restaurant is located in an old historic building built on top of a canal. it has a good but not extremely big selection of food. overall a good place to relax while shopping or visiting the town.
no star. but star prices. amuses. 15 per glas. very young personnel. so where is the change. basically the same as in the past but higher prices.
"the expectations to this place was bigger than the experience. the food and wine was okay, apart from a wines that did not match the sweetness of the desert. the staff tried their best, but there were too few waiters on too many tables. this dragged the whole experience down, as we had to wait very long between each serving. price was ok."
"it wasnt really spectacular. perhaps we xpected too much but sometimes the experiments in the nouvelle cuisine are overdone. the taste is still the most important. a very big wine card and i must admit the sommelier gave us good advise. we dont want the wine included menu and so his advise was necessary. the personnel is very friendly as well, but the result wasnt as expected"
"whilst i cannot deny that the food at la trinite is fantastic, unacceptable service and unprofessional staff means that this restaurant does not warrant michelin star stat "
"before they moved to their current location, we went multiple times and had always had a good time. we were a party of four, and decided last minute to go have dinner at their new location. we were quite early, compared to other parties. we had an aperitif and received some appetizers that, we thought, gave a good first impression. we chose the menu, and were extremely disappointed by the portions. first of all they were very small and it took a long time before the dishes followed. we were set first at table and ended with the last table set. we had to wait a long time, we had to eat a lot of bread to feel satisfied, not ok! also the main course, pigeon, was served with almost no vegetables, too bad. we had ordered an extra dish, the beemster xo (10€ extra) and hoped for an original preparation of it. instead we received 5 pieces of cheese with some mustard (again disappointed, for a 1 star michelin you have other expectations "
its hard to find a waffle in such old taste. it  was cold too and tasted like something just coming out of the storage bag. no idea such a pretty restaurant produced such type of food. really  amazing....
"despite the nice garden and terrace outside for the kids , this restaurant is terrible ! the service staff is absolutely rude ! the food is average and very expensive "
"i remember going there often with family and friends until this extremely unfriendly garçon served us with a very bad attitude. so it took us a few years to try it again..what a mistake! we sat under a umbrella because the weather was unsure. the table was dirthy and i asked politely to clean it up as the waiter threw menus on the table telling us to choose another clean table!! then he came back to us to clean it up mumbling arrogently you could thank me, say please, etc... i then decided to leave this place! he was yelling at us like we were scum! a horrible experience ! never again will i enter this restaurant again ! the owner should hire proper waiters. she is responsible for her waiters."
this is a fine place very beatifull but service isnt good we orderd pancakes and they warned us that needed the table in 30 minutes. we got the pancakes in 30 minutes so we hurried up. never comming here again.
"where should i start : slow and rude service, wrong orders, uncooked and cold food which is ridiculously overprice "
"first the good stuff: the service is good, the waiters are very friendly and very helpf "
wanted to dine with my 2 kids and my wife unfriendley person told kitchen is closed but dozen of people inside perhaps i have to wear a suit next time! not happy not smart not familyfriendly not to recomend!
have been several times to this family owned business in the lovely center of to 
"this is more a quiet place on a shopping tour for the afternoon coffee or a snack than a restaurant in a busy commercial town. we first had to change seats as on the terrace in front only drinks are served. then we had a coupe fresh fruit with cream, that for 10 € had only very little fruit in full summer season and came, although we explicitly asked for only vanilla ice-cream, with the standard 3 flavors. the so called giant croque monsieur 9,50€ was all but giant. the service was clearly overstretched on a sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere is cosy, also because there are many guests. this might change if the prices do not become more reasonable, with 2 coffees our bill was 25,40€."
we we were here with 3 people. wanted to eat but didnt get any further than drinks. waiters were too busy. when we told one we wanted to order food he told that his other colleagues handle the ordering. after another half hour we decided we want to leave. getting the check took long. guy had no change for a 50 euro note 
lousy service. unfriendly and not at all efficient. food - if you get it in reasonable time - lousy. so avoid and pass on the message. lindenhoeve lousy place and should closed down.
we went to taste the waffles and they were just disgusting. same for the ice cream which tasted like butter and fat... first we waited a long time and nobody came to take our order. we asked then and the waitress was rude. they never cleaned the table and when we asked them to do it they were even ruder and not polite... well never go there again !!!
we had a bongo luxe breakfast with bubble

"very stingy : we were two and first ordered a large pot of tea (for 2 pers.) but they refused to bring an extra cup, because the boss wants every client to order a drink... !!! incredible and so shameful. "
"we have been going to this restaurant on various occasions over the last 2 years, weve seen the service deteriorating over time (as ive also read in the other reviews "
we just ate a pancake/waffle on their quite nice terrace (full of noisy kids but i didnt mind that da 
"the food in this place was ok though quite expensive by dutch standards. the main advice id give is this. they have two menus, the cheaper and more extensive of which is advertised outside the restaurant while the other, which is much more expensive, is not. when the waiter shows you to a table, he will lay a tablecloth and give you the expensive menu. all you have to do is to ask for the cheaper menu (the bistro menu, i think they call it). the waiter will then take away the tablecloth and give you the menu you actually want. you then have to put up with a grumpy waiter who thinks youre a cheapskate but the food is fine (and you can decide how much to tip the waiter...)"
we sat down for a quick bite. we got so much more.. it was very good. see below the picture of the tortillas.
"i was here for a lunch, light soup and meatkrokets. the peesoep was very good but the meat was not so present in the croquets i ve got served , nice salad aside and fresh bread. still a good place to go, for sandwich or meal."
"the restaurant has a wonderful location and looks very pretty inside. we selected the place based on the tripadvisor reviews but failed to realize that (late) in the afternoon we only get the lunch menu. after our disappointment, we still decided to stay. the menu was more like a magazine and was only in dutch (i was quite surprised to find the lack of english menus in quite a few places – needless to say, in most places the wait staff could translate the menu for us). the food was ok but nothing special. what annoyed us –and apparently other guests too – that we had to wait an awful lot for both the food and the bill. maybe, the high ranking of the restaurant is due to the food that is served in the evening."
"the day menu was quite ok for its price. the fries and fish were nice, but i didnt feel completely full after the meal. all in all an ok place, but not the best."
"terrible, slow service.  wanted to try several tapas, but was ignored so long that could only try one of the dishes.  i did have dessert. the helado de caleta, a mix of ice cream, caramel,  and 43 liquor, was delicious."
quite a nice restaurant. the pasta dishes are not overwhelming. meat and pizza is very good. in summer time they have a nice out door area where its very cosey. ideal for some nice evening when it is not to hot.
"auberge brasserie van gogh is next to the vincent van gogh huis museum and is approachable from the back exit of the museum. so it is a logical place to enjoy a drink and something to munch after a visit to the museum. the coffee was ok, but sadly the cake was not available. it was nice weather, so everything is fine, yes? but the ambiance left something to be desired. we were clearly not from the village in the eyes of the staff and a dog, clearly belonging to the restaurant, was scurrying about, giving the impression that hygiene was not the first priority. to be fair, i didnt notice anything untowards regarding maintaining hygienic standards, but the impression was there. prices were of the elevated level, to be expected in the netherlands. the restaurant is nice enough as a watering place for museum visitors, but not so special to warrant a detour of your trip."
nice experience but maybe too many little dishes trying to impress ending up filling the guest too much. some of the dishes had very nice combinations (especially one with salmon and caviar) but i did not make it to the dessert or the cheeses which looked appealing precisely because of the too many amuse-bouche 
"went there a few times, location very nice, interior and setting average to poor! food is so, so, no feeling of genuine cooking more convenience cooking. although the staff is friendly the whole place is average."
"the food was better then i expected. we had a schnitzel plate. schnitzel was a bit oily and watery(from defrosting) but all in all tasty enough, salad and fries where very good. price was also good. did find the pancake prices a bit high. when looking for a bite, its okay enough to go here."
"when you are very hungry it is a good adress to eat price/quality is good. sometimes you have to wait a little wile,friendly personel"
"we ate at this restaurant for the first time. the food was good and organic. small list of meals. but the service was not very friendly and helpfull. so i will not come here back soon, a pity."
"stopping for a lunch after a few hours cycling across some beautiful landscape in the delft-rotterdam area, the indigo looked very promising from either side, the canal on one and the parking on the other at the back of the building with a terrace in the sun. the place must have been some sort of factory and is now converted into a multi purpose gathering place. on this sunday early afternoon there was a jig going on in the main restaurant, but the place was not really busy. service was slow and not very professional (students from the nearby technical university of delft?) and the portions - we had soup of the day and the vegetable quiche - nouvelle cuisine size for the price of a full fare."
"been several times and it was always great, both food and service. the service was then always taken care of by an experienced lady and young man (both latin?). so far so go "
yes the spare ribs of the house are quite ok. and the service was relaxed and friendly. the location is fi 
"quite a small restaurant, service was very slow. we got a free round of drinks after complaining to management for the length of time it was taking for our meals to arrive. we only ordered a main course because it took to long to arrive. we were the first to arrive in the restaurant and another table after us was served before us . when our food was finished we sat with empty plates in front of us for quite some time before they were cleared. the food was tasty but expensive. staff not that friendly. no atmosphere of the food culture served. "
"never had pizza like this, so grea "
"the waitress was touching the pizza with his hands to see what is under the pizza on the plate. no rules for higiene. when i said to him i wont eat this pizza that you were touching with the unwashed hands, he said that the pizza was not for me and brought it to another person :))) not professional:"
"nice atmosphere and staff, but i would not go here if you are not a tiny person or cant afford to buy two main dishes. 80 grams of fish, and 100 grams of baked vegetables at a price of €17,-. fries cost €6,50 on top. the seasoning was nice, however."
in the middle of the center of drunen (famous because of the sand dunes and woods: de drunense duinen) is this cosy restaurant. staff is friendly and one can relax on the outside terrace if the weather allows it. the food is ok but not special as is the wine. just a nice place to have a bite after a walk in the woods.
nice location and ambiance but the rest was really dissapointing. the food was not even close to the italian foo 
"a family italian restaurant, not so bad. food was ok, but the place is really oldated. prices are reasonable"
"so hard to resist the apple pie and when we were cycling past the menu board at lely, we had to stop! morning tea time anyway! lovely al fresco area in an open town square,with plenty of seating, very attractive flower baskets and pots, added to the atmosphere. friendly staff too all made for a pleasant interlude, and glad we stopped here."
"the pancakes were quite nice averaging 13 euro each however the service was slow, we waited ages for the menu, then the ordering then the pancak "
"pleasant outside seating area. slow service, despite screen camera showing outside being available to internal staff. good service and value for money. negative in that whilst near the end of our coffee the staff stood and waited for us to finish, ie. it felt that you were being rushed."
"the service was very good. im not a big venison fan so the main course was a little disappointing.. thats what happens when you choose the surprise menu :) .. saying that, it looked delicious.. and the rest of the dishes were very nice."
"it is a nice place to sit for coffee and quick lunch. lunch menu was limited, not so many choices. bread with fishburger was just fine. a young boy staff did not really pay attention to the service. we waves our hands, he saw us but he did not come to us. the other girl did. the restaurant next door can be a better choice. "
"in this place i had possibly the worst burger (and meal!) ever! in my opinion overpriced, we paid 48€ for two burgers and a kid menu. the burger was small and not good quality and some of the fries were burnt. absolutely not recommended."
"i ate at stach march 2015 during a business trip. the staff was friendly, service quick and the salad was very good. a very dutch restaurant with clean modern lines, lots of windows and black frames. very relaxing. a cool thing is that they have a little grocery with take away lunches, sandwiches, curry, soups, and lots of chocolate!!!!"
this is a good beach club with decent food and drinks. not special or exceptional compared to other beach clubs but never the less good place to stop for a coffee.
we went to san blas and had a dinn 
"very nice decoration, and the the place be itself have a good locati "
"visited on one of te last evenings of summers, chose sans blas for it’s location and the up and coming sunset only to be totally disappoint "
"good location, easy to reach since it is the first restaurant at the entrance to the beach. drinks were good, but the panamanian food was not even close to what we experienced in panama itself. not sufficient staff, we were not able to get the attention to order a dessert."
waited 45min to be served. after chasing the waiter i did get served but no one cleaned my table for almost 90min. food arrived cold and i was waiting for it another 45 min
"my family and i walked into san blas to have some drinks and possibly dinner. its a lovely spot overlooking the beach. we had to wave down the servers who both seemed surprised to see us even though they were clearly open for business. they took our drink order and then we had to ask if they were serving food and request a menu....again, our very young and seemingly inexperienced server was happy to oblige but seemed surprised by our request of a menu at a restaurant. the four of us opted for a couple of appetizers while we waited for the rest of our party of 14. before they arrived, we astutely decided to pay our bill and go elsewhere for dinner. we just felt we would overwhelm the poor girl if we tried to order dinner for 14 even though there was plenty of room for us."
ssn blas is a horrible place with crap food and terrible service. i would give it 0/5 if it was possible.
"weve been looking for a table for 2, and found a table inside while outside it was fu "
the gnocchi was way too overpriced and contained almost no mushrooms and artichoke. the heineken we received was a small airplane bottle (25cl) which is just scammy for the price we paid. sad!
there was no english menu! the waiter had to explain all the dishes to us! food was ok. very crowded
"waiting 30 minutes at the table until the waitress tells you they have too much orders so she’s not allowed to take new ones for another 15 minutes.... in the meantime, the tables are not even cleaned up...."
"panamanian-themed beach bar/restaurant. pleasant outdoor dining on a good day. however,lunch choice very limited.and some dishes not very filling. best choice-spicy pulled chicken."
"here the good thing is the large choice of types of seatings. sofas benches or chairs with tables, in the sun or shade or even inside, all the in a very nice atmospher "
san blas is a cozy restaurant at the beach and that is mostly what is about for me. they have nice decoration with details referring to panamá (probably the name has to do with one of the countrys island 
"nice location, quite nice fish. but young waitress pourred wine over jacket, jeans, backpack. no one came to apologize, forgot to bring new glas of wine, asked us, what we would like them to do... ?! kind of wrong attitude towards guests. if they would have brought some coffee/sweets on the house, everything would have been ok. at the end no one really seemed to be interessted in solving the situation. at least our wine was taken off the bill. sadly, chef waitress was very aggressive in the end..."

"weve been to san blas a couple of times. the food they is not so great, the service could be more attentive, and the house parrot in the restaurant is annoying. but ... san blas is a great (and the only) beach place to stop for holtkamp cakes. sea view, good coffee and a great tasting piece of cake. well come back for that (alone)."
"had lunch and ate some mackerel fish, foccacia mozzarella and croquettes. mackerel was very nice rest was just fine, nothing special. just a nice place for normal prices in comparing to the other restaurants in the neighbourhood. staff is very young and needs to be more hospitable and pay more attention to the guests but unfortunately thats a common problem nowadays...."
"it is a nice location at the beach, but.... you have to be very patient and wait a long time before you get your drinks. my partner got his beer quick enough but after half an hour my coffee arrived. then another 20 minutes before our apple pie arrived, it tasted good but was difficult to eat because of the small pastry dish and the low table were we s "
"came to this restaurant after a very disappointing experience next door. we were served quickly just before things got busy. waitress spoke several languages which was pleasant, menus available in english, german and dutch (we were a dutch/german party). drinks arrived quickly but food took a while. when a member of staff was flagged down he said he would check but never returned. asked another waitress and she said there has been an error and food should arrive shortly. all in all we waited over 45 mins for our food because of these errors, no excuse offered. however, i think this was a genuine error, it was a nice day with almost all tables occupied, staff was just unable to cope with the peak times. the food is tasty and the portions are large. drinks were nice and service pleasant. out of the 3 restaurants that i know at this location this is my favorite. "
nice location and the food was ok but we had to wait 1 hour for a simple breakfast. clueless waiters!
"the service was so poor, we waited 15 min to order and another 15 min for our difficult order. 2 heineken beer ;-) in bottles ;-) the food was delivered with so much love on the neighbors table, so we decided to leave. best idea we had. beer is about 3.50 euro, i better do not think about food prices. but the way, beer prices where not on the menue, so its a suprise what you pay in the end. oh, i nearly forgot the dj, his records hang 3 times while we were visiting. i think, he pays tribute to the service ;-)"
"had dinner here with friends. despite the fact that it was super busy due to the nice weather, the staff was pretty quick, attentive and sweet (even though they mustve been having a hectic day) the food however is dreadfull... seriously €14 for a salad with overcooked couscous, a few lost tomatoes (2 to be exact...) and some cheap plastic-tasting lettuce. you could tell that the chef here basically threw some cheap products together on a plate. the chocolate fondant was completely overcooked, i guess they do not know that the centre is supposed to be runny? on top of that its served with some overripe strawberries, and that will cost you €7 a piece. definitely not coming back here. do not recommend."
"this place looks great and i have been here several times in the last couple of years. awesome view of the sea, comfy places to sit, tasty foo "
we had to wait a lot to be attended.   kitchen closed 20 minutes after the time set on the menu. we could only ask for snacks.

"had lunch at the place before heading for the beach . limited variety of food but excellent salads , coffee and drinks . the service is slow and poor . they take time to clear the tables , probably its due to the crowd . there is a lot of scope for improvement . it could have been better ."
"ok, so the interior is quite nice and cozy in a rugged way, some kind of starbucks meets pirates of the carribean exotic coffee bar design. you can watch the beach. and thats about i "
staff here dont seem to cope well when its busy. they look like they are running around like headless chickens. ordered a beer.. 45 mins later still not arrived
"terrible service. after waiting for 30 minutes, i finally got someone and asked for a menu. in 20 minutes that still was not brought over. so went to get it myself. then again even though i asked several waitresses to order, they just kept saying that they will send someone over which they didnt so again after 30 minutes went inside to order at the bar. there were several mix ups with the orders a few times, not to mention how long it took them to bring out the food. probably could walk out without paying as no one was interested to bring the check either, had to go inside for that as well. in the end i think they mis-calculated and overcharged, but they never gave the receipt and i was ready just to get out of there. i can understand a place being busy, but there the staff was even quite rude."
"sat on the terrace which has a beautiful view of the park, lake and castle.  the menu is limited but served well."
an arrogant owner who only is interested in making a quick buck and not at all worried about the customers experience made our experience not the best ever. the food is mediocre at best. would never go back to this place.
great place for a stopover for a cup of coffee and a delicious pastry. actually everything is oké except that it rather cold and sober decorated.  anyway its not easy task in keeping an orangery in octwarm and cousy.
"baguette with salmon, there are better and tastier; overpriced. cup of coffee, only brown coloured hot water.  cognition: rip-off."
"the cheese roll, yoghurt and apple pie were good to eat but the young person serving me had more interest in her friend than trying to serve me. i appeared to be a problem asking for english breakfast tea and hadnt been replenished on the serving table. she may be identified as 603408 eden "
avoid this place at all costs.  paid in pounds and was given less euros. a bill for 15cent euro ended up paying 3 euros.  the manager couldnt help but got very furious when i showed them their reviews
avoid this place as i was double charged for my food! i was in a hurry and tapped my credit card and when i got back to the states - a sandwich and banana should of cost me $12 ended up getting charged twice and see 2 charges of $12. evidenced in my credit card statement. 
"we got a couple of beers and sandwiches which were heated quickly, but there were many disgruntled customers waiting for burgers and other food for at least half an hour and even one guy just waiting for a beer. several employees, most just standing around. appeared to be very poorly and inefficiently managed, service was a little snipp "
"waited over 20mins for my food to arrive. i went up and asked how long, a very rude member of staff told me just to wait. then he tried to serve me food that had been sat there for 10mins, which i refused. i had ordered fish and chips. it looked nothing like it!!!! then suddenly another appeared after i refused the first one. i was not confident that that was made fresh so again refused this one. the extremely rude server made a comment, in dutch, so couldn’t understand it. so i got a refun "
"€7.10 for a can of beer (a “bottle deposit” of €0.15 charged, even though it was a can) and €8.45 for a ham sandwich. ridiculous prices."
"i expect an airport restaurant to be ridiculously overpriced. this place didnt disappoint in that regard: 16 euros for a burger and over 4 euros for a coke. however, theres no excuse for bad service and an equally bad response. before i ordered, i talked to the guy who was doing the cooking. i wanted an absolutely plain burger. no condiments. no seasoning. just the plain meat. we talked for a full minute and he assured me he would make a plain burger for me. i waited about 15 minutes and then the burger was ready. when i walked up to the counter, i immediately saw that the burger was not plain. it had lettuce, tomato and mayo on it. the cook yelled over that it was plain but then came over and saw for himself that it was not. instead of offering to prepare a new plate, he started scraping the condiments off and put the patty on a new roll. hard to do this with mayo on the patty! they have their ketchup in small plastic containers. i asked the woman behind the counter for an extra container so i could kill any leftover taste of the mayo and she refused, saying we charge extra for those! she had zero customer handling skills, especially in light of their mistake. i see from other reviewers that poor customer service seems to be a recurring theme here. i dont expect that the restaurant will improve because of my review nor do i expect others to avoid this place because of it. but bad service should be called out."
"10 years living in the netherlands and this airport (inside) is still a overpriced, rodent invested, lacking in customer service, mismanged, false advertised and uncompetive peice of crud. hms host and their staff and the worst i think not a single one lnows haccp, the food choices are bread or bread. plus the staff are treated like dirt hence the reason nobody wants to work here."
"poor cappucino, is was too hot and bad taste. one of the  table or bar was uncleaned. there was empy dish. service was slow."
"like most airports drinks are relatively expensive, likewise snack food. area can be quite busy and as some people in a rush very little attention to social distancing.  apple pie is quite nice and tasty."
ordered burger with coke tom 30 minutes before the burger was finished  fries were ok but the burger was red inside complaining did not work they said that was there way to do it never again there
their staff was not giving any attention to customers. unpolitisch and rough. questions were not answered properly. the tables were inaccessible and no allowance to rest! notably in a restaurant.
"drinks in harvest market 654 look overpriced. 4.95 euro for a 750ml bottle of water. the seats next to us were not cleaned with dirts all over the place. the cashier was grumpy. what a place, but seemingly the last one at the end of the terminal."
"we went to hms host schiphol airport during departure from amsterdam in the last trip before quarantine, just few days before it start "
"after arriving at 07:30 on a flight from prague into the schiphol airport, we were starving for breakfast. the hms host schiphol restaurant looked inviting. we ordered a 3 egg omelet and 3 fried eggs, both came with a side of bacon. my partner ordered a diet coke as well. average typical airport food quality and service. total cost for two: €22.75."
"well, we never come here with big expectations and so we dont get disappointed. average quality with sometimes slow service. but at least expensive. :)"
i had a great coffee and opted for a beef burger as i was really hungry. i was glad i did not order the scrambled eggs as other customers had because they looked overcooked and unappealing. i thought 16 euro for a burger and coffee was quite expensive but i looked around and there was not much else available.
"due to an unexpected layover we needed to get some lunch. we chose hms host because it seemed rather busy and was on our way. we learned it was not the greatest choice. neither the food nor the service were very good. however, sometimes necessity out weighs selectivity. i must say there was plenty and we were ready to move forward."
"while waiting for a connecting flight we dropped in past this cafe for a quick snack,  and  the coffee and apple cake was very tasty."
"i stopped here before getting on my flight. i got the americano coffee and yogurt with some mango bits mixed in. the yogurt tasted very fresh and healthy. coffee was strong, but i left it in the bathroom and by the time i realized that and came back, the bathroom attendant had already disposed of it. oh well!"
ordered a vegan cup just 4.50 but charged me a salad cost 7. 
"in transit at schipol airport and desperate for a hot drink, we came to hms host and ordered two hot chocolates. they were small, no more than room temperature and cost 7.30 euros. a complete waste of money. avoid."
for airport bar this was not exceptional but functional and service was quick and good drinks were of good quality and price not overly expensive
"only ate here because it was close to my departure gate. i wouldn’t have chosen it if there had been other options. the fish sandwich wasn’t very good, and the bacon and egg crepe was passable. helpful and friendly cashiers, though."
"naturally fast food was extremely slow and the staff was incompetent. the food we got served was cold. when we took a tray he said we took the wrong tray, meaning he wanted to put the receipt on our tray instead of a new tray he could just have grabbed. when watching customers we’re served coffee in to go cups but there were no kids that fit the larger cups. all in all...not great"
i did not realize that this was a starbucks when i first went but the service was good and the coffee was too.
"ordered gourmet extra cheese burger and cappuccino. run by kids, not very clean, initially they gave my burger away, then put a sheet of cheese on the other guyys burger and gave me his. coffee was half full, salad turning and coleslaw looked and tasted half dead. apart from that it was what i expected from airport food. gives street food a bad name."
"crazy prices! not so much choice in the mornings and people working there not friendly at all, so tired not even see you standing in front of them."
"used a kebab place in the airport... well where do we start... we wanted burger, they had no burgers, wanted a chicken burger.. none of them either. "
avoid this spot if you are having lun 
"was ok for the momento, just eat and  "
the cost of 2 very pricey lattes was 6.80 euros almost 10 canadian dollars served in paper cups and to top it all off they didnt have any lids.
"we ate lunch for satay chicken 20,25 € and burger 20,75 €. awfull mess. never again. quality - price is poor."
"after standing in front of the restaurant waiting to get seated an employee told me to just pick a seat...in doing so another employee comes and says that i need to queue up for being seated. after telling him, that this was exactly what i did, he insisted to get me back to the start of the line. asking for his supervisor i needed to wait for quite some time and then explaining the manager what happened she was very unprofessional and noch customer oriented, telling me that she hears two different stories (from her employee and me) and does not want to find out what really happened. neither she or the employee who sent me back to the row expressed any sorry for the inconveniences....and this even although there were other people that had seen the whole story. i finally got a seat and some food (which was ok but not at all really good or even outstanding) but now at 20:00 they stopped serving food (as i wanted tom order a dessert) although the restaurant does not close before 21: "
i really like food and wine here but it is not the first time people who work there don’t know what customer service is! for place like schipol with such prices you have to invest in training for people who work for you so they know how to treat clients! especially if they dont speak dutch!!! very very dissappointing!!!!
ordered the bratwurst and fries and a lipton lemon drink.  the bratwurst was good enough to fill me up and keep going. choice of sauces at your disposal.  nothing too exciting but ok for a quick bite of cooked or cold meals.
"please doublecheck the products before buying. fresh juice in their minds is a pre-produced concentrated crap thay they sell for 5.90 a glass.  do not visit, go to another place, there are plenty on schiphol."
"i visited the hmshost heineken bar 152 at the top of the d gates whilst returning from marseille to bristol via amsterdam last week. i had time for a quick beer on the way from c gates to d gates and noticed the familiar green of a heineken bar. when it is a bar dedicated to a particular beer, you expect the best because there is no choice, only heineken. ok, so its not my favourite beer and , in my opinion, it ranks at the lower end of the scale against such beers as moretti, estrella damm, kirin ichiban and six point, however i do not object to a nice pint of heineken when time is short and it is the only bar in sight. it was not busy and i sat at the bar where two young girls were working. as soon as i sat down, one disappeared and the other began stacking glasses making sure that i had noticed her intentional ignorance. she made it clear that she had issued a challenge and, as i was short of time, i took up her challenge and said excuse me, can i have a pint of heineken please?. she looked around with an expression of disgust and replied when i have finished this. after a short time, she pulled a pint of heineken and requested five and a half euros. i paid the extortionate rate and took a gulp of the beer which was totally without gas. it was cold, granted, and it tasted like heineken, but it was flat. i called her back and explained that the beer was unsatisfactory. at this point, she said that she would provide a replacement. she pulled another beer and looked upon it noting that this one was lacking in fizz also. a male member of staff was now in attendance and he also pulled a half of the beer and gazed wistfully into the glass. they both then took the beer (her with the new pint and him with the half pint) into the back office to show yet another member of staff. i could see into this office from the bar and i observed many examinations of the glasses and much discussion therein. after around five minutes, i caught the eye of the male member of staff who had yet to venture from the back office and tapped my watch indicating that i needed a resolution to the matter before my flight departed. i was ignored and the original girl who had vacated the bar upon my initial arrival now re-appeared behind the bar. i said to her just give me a refund and i will be on my way to which she replied we cannot give a refund. i indicated to her that the beer was undrinkable. at this point i was starting to get a little agitated and within ten seconds, the male member of staff who had pulled a half of the beer to examine appeared from the back office, opened the till and gave me five and a half euros and apologised profusely about the matter. i was on my way again and i purchased a can of heineken at the shop at the gate (admittedly at the ridiculous price of five and a half euros). we all know that airport prices are a rip off but please, if youre going to rip us off, at least make sure that the product is fit for consumption!!!!!"
"this place is nothing really special, but it sure comes in handy when you need a quick bite to eat while waiting in schipol airport for your plane to depart. my wife had a yoghurt parfait type of thing, i had a caprese sandwich, and we each had sparking water. the food was just okay, the prices were slightly high (but that is expected in an airport), and the service was fast."
we had quick lunch before our flight back to ho 
this has got to be the slowest burger king i have ever visited. fifth person in the queue and waited 20 minutes to be served to get a microwaved childrens cheeseburger.
my wife and i wished to have something different rather than the usual fast food offering in airports so chose kebaya as it looked nice and the menu on the board was very appealing. the drinks were a bit pricey but its an airport restaurant! we ordered our meal using a state of the art  tablet device so thought we were at somewhere speci 
"visited their starbucks kiosk c - pier and it was efficient, good and costly but a very typical starbucks.  if youre looking for something to hold you over before a flight this works fine."
"terrible, expensive junk food. two hotdogs, one petite diet coke, 21.65 euros. rude waitress. yuck. we were in a hurry due to closely timed connections, but this experience in the airport was beyond awful. cold hotdogs. stale buns. rude service. next time, if were rushed, well skip eating anything here!"
+ smoking room next to cafe. - cold hotdogs for 8.95 eur but its ok to killing time. heineken draft beer - 5.55 eur
worst service i have ever experienced the waitress was so rude. as we had not finished our bottle of wine we asked for a cork so we could take it with us. the waitress responded with i’m busy ask at the bar. we asked her again as didn’t know where the bar was and was in a rush for our flight with this the same waitress told us we were rude and started to argue with us. i will never set foot in here ever again 
we arrive 10 minutes before they close and we saw 4 burgers available but they hid them to eat themselves..the workers prefer steal the products than sell burgers for 7€. 0% natural place
we were waiting for a noon flight but had not had breakfast. we wanted to sit down so there was a counter to do s 
enjoyed a decent cup of coffee while waiting for my flight to glasgow but should have refrained from ordering a warm sausage roll which was large and rather stodgy.  7:40 euros was expensive for very average food.
"well, its not really a special restaurant. they have enough choice from sandwiches to warm food. snacks, salads, soup etc. we got 2 cheese rolls, a small bowl salade, fries and a bowl soup and..... it cost us € 29,95. its expensive."
"thank you travel gods for airport cafés having real cups! the coffee tastes better and there is less waste. there must be a fb group dedicated to helping fellow travellers steal clear of styrofoam, paper cups with paper taste and pesky plastic lids!"
i has the looks of a fine asian restaurant at the airport but the food sadly is so insipid and tasteless and you pay a high price. i had miso ramen which was the worst i have ever had!
great location for a pre flight snack drink. clean tidy fast but be prepared for hefty charges as in the whole airport.
"the food is nice, but the prices are way to high. especially compared with the portions you get. there are better options."
"we ate here while waiting for our delayed plane. the lasagne was just fine, the pizza was ok, the beer was as it should be and the smoothie was ok as was the coffee."
"expensive, but tasty salmon sandwich ... in line with most airport prices. good location though, right in the middle of the terminal and large seating area. the view outside is also quite nice."
large assortiment in food and beverages   warm or cold. nice coffee.  good place to grab a snack just before your flight.  expansie but in line with other airports.  great view and terrace.
vast choices of restaurants at schiphol and we thought we would try the japanese restaura 
"good place to stop for a drink or snack, with views of planes and part of the runway, while you wait for your flight. not too expensive."
"everyone knows that eating outlets in airports are not cheap as they have a captive market, but given all the delicious food we had encountered on our trip, we at least expected reasoanble quality. there are a number of places to choose to eat and we would definitely not eat here again or recommend it when next passing through. the choice was very limited for drinks and food. my daughter and i ended up having very soggy and uninspiring, tepid pizza margharita with a beer, a diet coke and a chocolate milk. total cost 26 euros. my husband had an adequate burger from the counter next to this which was also overpriced. choose somewhere else to eat at the airport. it is a huge place and there are other choices."
"the coffee was good, but the ham and cheese sandwich was skimpy a banana and chocolate pastry was filling but not  wonderful"
stopped by to grab a quick bite before a trip. i had a sausage roll and a cheese roll. the cheese roll was quite good and much better than the sausage roll. the staff had a lot of customers going crazy and they handled our orders perfectly. excellent service. thank you!
i try to eat plenty of sashimi and sushi when travelling due to it being a healthy option. this airport location had a good choice and to be fair the food was good and fresh. service was good and you order you own dishes off a tablet menu with pictures of each dish which is a good way to see what you are getting. you can make worse choices in an airport. would return.
went to two of the hmshost opperated takeaway places. a breadstall and a grab&f 
place to stop by to have a sandwich and a drink before or after you take a flight or the train. ample sitting space. reasonable price.
"busy place with typical fast food you can find at the airport. nothing was too exquisite. sandwiches were, actually, awful, either empty or filled with chewy mea "
stopped in to get something to eat on the plane. options were limited but i got a bagel with cream cheese. probably got the wrong thing - was the worst bagel ive ever had.
nice place a bit hidden in the schiphol airport people are nice the food is good i got the two steaks forgot the name the one at 23€ it was too cooked for my taste the fully loaded burger is really big and good
"we blinked when we stopped here for a light lunch before our flight to the uk because we honestly thought wed been magically transported back to the wilds of north america where cardboard, tasteless take out food is the norm for a captive audience with no other options. the pizza was cold and lifeless as was the service. do yourself a favour and bypass this establishment."
food is very mediocre but they get away with it due to the captive audien 
had a piece of meat that was  cooked ok but the portion was not really so pleanty. the cost is not comparable to the quantity  probably  because its an airport.  it should be a bit more cost effettive.   the personel is friendly and quick.
once you have ordered food you might as well take the flight and come back at your leisure to collect your order. the staff are in no hurry whatsoever and will do everything to make your experience as lazy as thier service is. go to another place as there are plenty others at the airport. 
we were waiting for a connection flight and grabbed a sandwich and beer. the beer was offered extra cold and was very refreshing.  the sandwich was average but filled a gap. suggest this was better than others which looked worse!
had a terrible meal here that was not good at all. food was not warm and the prices where high.  will grab a snickers in the kiosk next time i feel hungry here.
nothing special but good enough. staff are friendly. note this is the kitchen near the casino. had omelette. did the job
"we had a slice of pizza, bread with smoked salmon, daysoup, 2 cofefe and 1 medium diet coke. 30 euros, do i need to say mo "
expensive for a cappuccino from an automatic machine (no moka) and a watered down powder made orange juice. the muffin was ok.
"this looked a lovely place inside the airport at the harvest market. however, it was so disappointing. 5 minutes before 11am they wouldnt serve a full english breakfast (even though service was until 11). i went for a cheese and chicken panini which was all dried up. the danish pastry was also dry. poor service and sub-standard food. could have been so much better. awful food and poor service. maybe it was a bad day? but it was only 10.55 am!"
"the food or drink you get is ok for a quick bite, but you will not be given a surprised by a huge quality. i have had better quality on other airports."
"my credit card bill shows hms host as charging for our meal, but reading the other reviews some clearly refer to landside outlets, other to airside outlets. this review covers the dutch kitchen, airside in the non-schengen part of the schiphol airport (so i think between piers e and f, near where the old rijksmuseum outlet used to b "
"this is very calm place away from the crowds--to reach it you must go up some stairs away from the rest of the airport. it is next to an outdoor area that gives you a nice view of the airport. we used it to kill some time while waiting for our flight. the service was very friendly and they have a nice variety of items ranging from cold sandwiches, paninis, lots of desserts, coffees and a wide variety of drinks including beer. the variety extends even beyond what ive listed. my chicken teriyaki sandwich was pretty good but ive had better. my wife loved what she got. prices were very reasonable by u.s. airport standards. all in all, this is a pretty nice place with, again, very friendly service."
"food is ok but the staff are slow in serving/preparing the food behind the counters, apart from the pizza section where they were speedy. there were long queues for most food counters i am sure because of the slow service. anyway, its fine for a pre-travel meal. "
"not good. a toasted panini with uncooked coronation chicken. they replaced it, but the replacement (bacon and egg) was oosing in fat. an all-round bad experience."
"right opposite the arrivals gates at terminal 3, this is a useful spot to wait for arriving friends/family. whilst waiting we had a cappuccino and a latte. both were very good and each was 3.75 e. didnt have any food but they seem to have the usual dutch snack foods."
coffee weak.  apple pie freezing cold.  moarella baguette tasteless.  insufficient staff to clear tables  what has happened to catering at airports?
"excellent food, service mixed. orders were lost in translation, but eventually we got more or less what we ordered. the staff were very pleasant but didnt confirm the order correctly. the food was fantastic, very tasty and nicely presented. we would eat here again but ensure the water understands before finishing the order."
"i have enough during the connection in the airport, and chose this café for lunch. the café looks quite presentable, and this determined my choice. for my amazement, the reality was, softly said, a little bit different. there were a few of visitors in the café but i waited a waitperson to make an order a lot of time. only accumulated tiredness and a really comfortable chair prevented me from simply getting up and leaving. the waitpersons discussed something near the bar counter, and i was obliged to come, go there and remind about my existence. the received lobster soup was slightly warm (however, the tea was really good). this café is not an eating house, and it looks different indeed when compared to the other cafés in the area. therefore, the expectations are appropriate. it remains to hope that it was like an exception in my case. sometimes, such exceptions occur. "
the staff were very slow and rude. i ended up not buying anything but still sat in their lounge.  find other places to spend your money.
worst service there has been over this weekend. oeuf cocotte overcooked and so late my cup of tea had gone cold whilst waiting
"acted as though they were doing me a favor, by seating us and allowing us to eat here.  staff never checked to see if food was good, if we had what we needed …. will avoid in the future!"
"i would love to be able to make contact with the owners. what a disgraceful place, lots of staff doing nothing and extremely rude. i had to clean the chair as it was covered in butter, floor filthy table filthy, at this rate i should have left. waited thirty minutes to order , received a tiny glass of champagne, and another fourty five mins later i received oven baked eggs that were microwaved and the waiter giving out hell to me for ordering breakfast that was clearly marked all day breakfast on the menu, disgusting food. i asked for the manager and was ignored went to the counter and a lady who was clearly not the manager told me that she was, i explained my experience and she actually grunted at me, offered no apology, and charged full price of €28, guess they get a lot of complaints and are used to  "
"coco’s should learn basic french if serving french items. hear me out, this isn’t an “only real french food is good” rant. i came to the airport very early for a transatlantic flight. surprisingly, lines were short and i had time for a coffee and a croissant at coco’s. after being directed away from an open one person seat at the bar to a long line a waiting patrons and waiting 20 mins only to be seated in the same seat i originally was told to leave, i brushed off my irritation and looked forward to the “large cafe crème” and croissant on the menu. i had to ask for the menu and the waiter was irritated that i could not order off the bat. everything that was being served to other patrons though looked goo "

waited 18 mins - couldn’t get anyones attention then finally i was able to ask the girl behind the bar for a glass of champagne. wanted to have lunch but they took too long. lots of visiting amongst the staff with each other - they need to get to work!

"we stopped off at cafe coco for what we thought would be a quick coffee. after waiting for 15 minutes to be served, i approached the bar and was promptly told to return to the table as there was a waiter who would take our ord "
"a group of four, well seasoned travelers, we first could not get the staff to clean the counter of dishes (at least 10 minutes from the previous customers). when we ordered 4 hot chocolates we were served 1 with no others in site for 5 minutes. we asked about our drinks and wanted to order food. we were ignored. after another 5 minutes we were told it was coming. after another 5 minutes we asked for a manager. we were told no one was in charge. the attitude was arrogant. this is not the service we have experienced in the past at schiphol airport. avoid if possible."
"second time in less than a month where they have let themselves down with the service, or should i say lack of  "
"this is the hardest that i have ever worked to get a coffee. the staff were rude, unhelpful and arrogant (except for the lone guy working there who should be put in charge of staff training, starting with teaching the others how to smile - it really was that poor). i still don’t understand the seating arrangements and neither did the vast majority of other customers that the staff spent the bulk of their time moving on, rather than getting on with their jobs serving. avoid like the plague."
"do not bother to waste your time and money going here. the service is the most appalling i have had in a very long time. we arrived and sat down, happy to try what looks like a lovely cafeteria in the middle of a busy airport and proceeded to be ignored by all staff. until we decided "
first and last time to this place. €10+ for a coffee and croissant and needed to wait 30 mins while “they prepare it”. really poor.
"arrived early morning after sleepless overnight flight and looking for a spirit-lifting breakfast at schiphol. cafe coco looked like the right place: attractive setting, varied and seemingly sophisticated menu, courteous personnel. unfortunately, the place is not up to its promise mainly due to the total lack of flexibility and customer attention. they have smoked fish platters on the menu and i request just a simple plate of smoked salmon with a slice of toasted bread: impossible! there is no kind of bread in this fancy place (?!?). i end up ordering a weird egg soufflé topped with two slices of smoked salmon which has all the skin and the dark parts on each slice, and has been significantly heated by the underlying hot egg stuff (which is not particularly tasty). at the end i ask for more hot water in my teapot (tea was made with real leaves and a pretty good brand, in all fairness) and they reply that for hot water i have to pay for a new tea (nearly 5 euros!) even if i use the same leaves. dutch rigidity? or just plain lack of attention to customer satisfaction? weird."
"had a morning flight and arrived at the café around 10:00 am. the place was busy. lots of empty dirty tables. since the sign said to seat yourself we did but there were no clean tables so we sat at a dirty table hoping to have it cleaned soon. we sat at a table for 2 right in front of the cashier. the waitress saw us sit down and came over within about 5 minutes and asked us what we would like to order. i quizzically looked at my husband wondering if she was going to clean the table first. she was not. i looked at her and said that we just sat down and had not looked at the menu yet. could she please clean the tables. she said nothing and picked up the dirty plates, cups and utensils. she was surely annoyed i had asked. she came back again and asked what we would like. i told her i would like it if she would wipe down the table since there was clearly someone elses leftover food scraps and water rings. she again looked very annoyed and said she would. she waited 10 more minutes to come back and wipe of the table then took our order. i ordered the baked eggs but asked for no meat or cheese which apparently is in all the baked egg dishes. she looked at me and said no meat or cheese? i said that is right and she looked astounded but left. we waited 30 minutes for 2 baked eggs with coffee and croissants. meanwhile no tables were cleaned and many people, at least 5 that i counted, went to the counter as asked to have the table cleaned and several people were tired of waiting for a server. they too had to get up and ask for help. no one ever came to see if everything was okay which it was not. our egg bake was undercooked and runny at the bottom. having to catch a flight in 20 minutes we decided to just not bother getting another one."
cafe coco was the last place open late at night when we were about to catch a flig 
"i never complain, but really feel the need to today (and signed up to trip advisor for the first time). this was truly terrible food and terrible service! €25 for an over cooked (asked for rare got well done) thumbnail size of beef and a plate of broccoli. when i complained the waiter (cynthia) just ignored the complaint, carried on with her duties and didn’t make any attempt to resolve the issue / refer it to someone more senior. never eat here !! if you’re in the airport go to burger king for a better meal and better service."
"me and a colleague sat down and ordered, breakfast and latte for me, coffee for him. been waiting for breakfast now for over 40 minutes, my colleague had to leave after 30 minutes without getting his coffee. the latte came after 10 minutes, and is passable."
"nice meal, slow service but a decent choice for a bite between flights. helps that we were there off-peak!"
"we were at schiphol waiting for a later flight and quite tired and hungry, so we chose this (lproper) restaurant, as opposed to one of the convenient cafes or self service places. the service was insanely awful, including not even bringing two of the items we ordered. the rest of the food made airline food taste marvelous -- we were served some sort of microwaved, cardboard tasting pasta with practically raw, cold vegetables on it. when i mentioned all of the problems, they removed the items we hadnt ordered from the bill, which left a still very expensive tab for absolutely rubbish food. avoid this place at all costs and either dine before you get to the airport -- or choose any other food!"
"in the past i have lunch here several times. it is not a place to be in a rush to catch the plane but to take the time and yes, service has as far as i experienced always been slow. but the food was of above average you could get at schiphol airport. last time this was unfortunately not the case. the food was horrible. no taste, no dressing in the salad, prefab? unbelievable bad and still quite expensive."
"the food is just ok, the fish which took 30 minutes to come on the table was overcook, when i asked for a side basket of break ive been ignored by the staff.  however the place is quiet with a nice view on the planes."
"a beautiful little cafe in the airport. the breakfast menu was small but i was looking forward to trying the baked eggs. it was okay, just okay. a bit flavourless and a pretty small portion. the coffee and service was good though."
"having arrived exhausted at schiphol airport to get our flight back to london heathrow, we made our way to what appeared to be a lovely quiet corner in ‘ cafe coc "
"i was very much looking forward to spending my layover time at café coco. it looked inviting and trendy. you could see food displayed like quiche, croissants, and numerous desserts , all temptin "
we both had a coffee here whilst waiting for a flight.  there was quite a queue - the coffee was fine but a bit expensive.
cafe coco inside the amsterdams airport was below expectations. the food quality and quantity was average.
"terrible service. ignored for ten minutes. a man pointed me out and they came five minutes after this, not concerned at all with customer service. pointed out the menu on the table (i hadnt seen it) - another 5-10 minutes passed and no one returned so i walked out, disgusted. menu looked great but attitude not worth paying money for."
"cafe coco gave me a pleasant half hours rest on a long stay in schipol. coffee ok, service ok, prices inflated - well it is in an airport!"
"croissant & cappuccino before flight. i sat at the bar, which had lots of dirty used plates, cups etc. even though staff saw the debris around me, it was not cleared. it took 10 mins to supply 1 croissatnt (with jam - which was more a sauce, gradually spreading across the plate} and a very small, medium cappuccino. i had to ask for a knife to spread the jam and spoon to stir the coffee. to be fair, watching other dishes being prepared, i think other dishes were better than my choice."
"this is a great spot for watching planes come and go, but at lunch yesterday my entree did not appear after a good long wait. i asked the waiter for my meal and she said it would be right up. another 10 minutes went by and still nothing. at that point we had to leave. our soup was ok but a very small glass of whiskey was a rip off at 12 euros."
ester the waitress swiped my credit card 8 times saying that system was down  when checked balance she charged 300 us dollars for a 25.14 transaction. this is horrible and no one will answer the phone there.
"i was looking forward to afternoon tea here after passing through schiphol on my way out. unfortunately i had a bad experience. the waiter directed me to sit at a table to be served and then he and two other colleagues served two other sets of people ahead of me, but who had arrived after me. on the second occasion, i indicated this to a waitress, who gestured to me to wait and actually said wai "
"good wines per glass, menu shows quality but still the dishes need to be cooked with care. all my requests were granted but i prefer to eat without need to ask."
"i had dinner at otium, the restaurant at the radisson blu. it was pretty good. i had the chicken supreme which is a chicken breast with with an asian sauce, bok choy and udon noodles. the flavor was good however the chicken had quite a bit of skin and fat and was a little rubbery. it wasnt bad, but not great eithe "
we had their 4 course m 
"i had a conference in the hotel, and i hesitated going to amsterdam. you can pay 70€ for a taxi (20 min), or take the shuttle (free, every 20 min) back to the airport and then the train (8€, 30 min), and then transport to where you need to go. not worth  "
"went to the otium restaurant when staying in the hotel recently. i was quite hungry so ordered from the main courses the chicken with potatoes and vegetables - i believe it was €24. when it came it looked like a childs portion - a small chicken brest, 1 carrot, one small piece of broccoli and 2 small potatoes. i finished it in about 5 minutes and was still hungry so ordered so ordered some bar finger food. what i had was nice but they are charging €24 for presentation so it was very poor value. i could have easily eaten double the amount, so if your hungry go elsewhere."
my husband and i had dinner here the night we stayed. for the price i really expected better quality. i had a filet or at least that is what i ordered. it was unlike any filet ive ever had. it looked like a filet but it was tough and not very tasty. the texture reminded me more of a club sirloin.
"this restaurant feels like its trying to join the big boys with terms like sous vide and smoked potato foam on the menu. we selected truffle risotto which was properly cooked but absolutely tasteless. there were tiny flecks of something brown in the dish, but it might as well have been sawdust for all the flavor it added. even the shaved parmigiano cheese and the bits of asparagus in the dish didnt manage to add any taste."
"we stopped in while staying at a nearby hotel, the park inn. i had the risotto with truffles which was cooked correctly but the broth was not boiled down properly and so it was soupy. i complained and the friendly waitress asked if i needed anything and suggested a free salad. her kindness was appreciated. with the risotto and a plate of cheese divided with my colleagues and part of a bottle of wine, i paid 31 euro."
"i stopped by for lunch while waiting for a flight. the food was very average, then again the prices arent too steep eithe "
"if you are around with some friends, you can jump by and have an evening talk even doe sometimes if full but is a pleasant restaura "
"staying at the radisson blu there isnt much option than to eat at otium, and although its not great value-wise i had a decent dinner."
"otium is unfortunately the only local dining option if youre staying at the radisson blu airport hotel. the service was slow, portions were small, the food is not very good and it is quite price "
"i came here because the radisson park inn hotel kitchen is closed on sundays, and they advised to come here, since it is hosted by the radisson blue hotel. i just wanted to have dinner, possibily without having to go bankrupt. i decided to take a quail salad: it costed about 12 €, and it was a portion so small it could have been ok for my 2 years old niece. just to give a term of comparison, for 10.50 € at the radisson park inn you can have a chicken salad, which turns out to be better both in quantity and in quali "
coffees were lukewarm and my friend’s mcflurry was literally served melted. very nice apple pie though!
"rude staff and overpriced product, always a bad combination. €2.40 for a hamburger which is €1.20 elsewhere in holland. when i questioned the price i was told its because you ate in the airport??? ridiculous."
"we dropped in for breakfast before driving back to the uk and used the interactive touch screens. we were a group of 12. the orders came through missing items - waitress said she would bring croissant to the table - it never came and it only arrived after 20 minutes when we asked where it was. three of us were given the wrong type of coffee which had to go back and be re-done. one of our mc muffins had a hair in - that went back and that friend had to wait for another. some people were waiting up to 20+ minutes for orders that were standard options on the order nothing special or unusual. staff seemed half asleep and didn’t seem to care and didn’t apologise when things were wrong. i appreciate we were a group of 12 but we knew this and were patient - also the place is huge and was empty we were virtually the only ones other than maybe 4 others, so it’s not like there was a back log of orders or lots of customers. overall poor, slow and lacking in customer care. "
"i would never recommend mcdonalds an a good restaurant, but this one has a twist. it have a clear vied of the runway and is a good place for plane spotting"
"being based at the airport this was less than a mcvalue meal, it was as if dick turpin was still alive. shockingly expensive but so are other eateries at the airport. the food was good, our party enjoyed it even though most of them only had eaten a few hours earlier."
"the menu and food is as expected for mcdonalds. however, the service is slow. on this day the automated registers were acting up and this slowed the entire process down. customers were not getting receipts and there was some frustrations being vented as the queue grew long "
"this mcdonalds is a short walk from the ibis hotels and about two miles from the airport. its modern, c!ran and offers electronic order placing and payment. the food is reasonably priced and quite nice. the french fries are a little thicker than in the us, but will please!"
"your typical mcdonalds. busy and staff are a little rude on the customer service aspect especially if youre visiting from another country. no toilets, which dont help."
how does one review a mcdonalds i wonder? well it was like most mcdonalds and had friendly staff. the special thing here is that it has a special plane spotting area outside with binoculars and all. inside they have a live overview of all planes coming and going and a screen with flight radar. a nice breakfast broodje with egg and bacon and coffee was good value. a small playground for children too.
"a bar and restaurant, all mixed together. the resatauant serves simple food and a speciality called the daghap, every monday. food for a low proce."
"we have previously had breakfast/ coffee here and, though the service was often slow, the food was good. today, however, we had no opportunity to sample the food, because we could not find someone who would serve us. when we arrived there were two customers outside and two inside who had already been served, and four tables were still littered with old cups etc. we asked twice for someone to take our order, but no one appeared. after ten minutes and still no service four other tables were occupied - and not served. meanwhile one customer outside who had asked several times for his bill (to no avail) left without paying. we registered our dis-satisfaction to someone who appeared to be in charge, who told us there were problems with their new system, though she and her colleague had been busy with arranging a pretty display and not clearing tables or serving customers. we were at least offered a cup of coffee which we declined. we shall not be returning."
"i went there with my son on a sunday midday to have some lunch. we sat down outside and looked at the menu. there were two waitresses serving the terrace of which one had sat down with some clients (her friends?) and was in a conversation with them. the other waitress took orders at some tables. she passed our table five times without even looking at us. at the sixth time i asked whether we could order something. she replied: ‘yes, but i am very busy’, and immediately went inside. again, she did not even look at us. when she came out after another two minutes, she again passed us without paying attention to us... unbelievable. at that point we got up and left. unnoticed by the two waitresses. absolutely uncalled for: what a rude, uninterested, incompetent staff! we live in the neighborhood, but will not be back."
"the service was good but the food was horrible.   it was the worst ravioli, i have ever tasted. disappointed :("
"bad service, even worse food. ordering a penne wodca i would expect a nice freshly made pasta. food showed up. felt like pre-packed food with some sausage added (!!!) and some sort of sauce which i have never ever had. the same with the pizza for my kids. way too strong cheese on top of a bottom which was clearly not crispy. we will never go back. the main employee clearly did not do an effort to host his clients. no attention for his customers or whatsoever. felt like he either had a miserable day or he does not have the skills a manager should have. "
"had dinner at la via on 5 april 2019. the restaurant was quite empty when we went in but was quite full soon thereafter. due to the rush, the service was not very good (we had to wait quite a while for the food to arrive) although the drinks arrived very quickly. perhaps, also due the busy evening, the food was not up to the mark as is usual at la via. all in all, a rather disappointing evening at a restaurant that we have always found to be quite good in the past."
typical italian place??? this is a place for people who love pizza and pasta??? have you ever tried proper pizza and past 
"this is a very bad restaurant. they lie to customers. please dont go there. i made reservation for 3 person at 18:00 today. but when i arrive there, there is no table for 3, just totally full. the lady lead us to a smaller table of 2, then said if we drink something and wait a bit, we will get table of 3 asap. however, the table next to us is emply soon, but they refuse to give us that table, but give to another group persons who even come later than us. this is so ridiculous! 1. they lie to customers about reservation, so they can come, 2. and lie again to let them order and wait, but then just do not give a table to customers. totally lie to customers."
"great pancakes but the service wasnt really good. we had to wait a lot of time for the waitress, even we needed to call one of them. i want to believe it was because we arrived in the change turn, i dont know... many families with children and big groups of people, so really noisy."
the restaurant serves pancakes and therefore most of the visitors are families or birthday parties. it is a bit chaotic and loud with so many children. there is a big variety you can chose of and the pancakes taste very good.
nice restaurant for with family and friends! and a great place a nice walk through the forrest.-----------------------------
"i have had a rather good dinner at this restaurant some years ago, so i tried again, albeit as a take-aw "
"the exterior of this restaurants looks rather run-down like so many bygone dutch-chinese eateries, but the interior is surprisingly clean and comfortable t "
"very decent lunch platter, very big portions. terrace is nice with shade or sunshine options. service wasn’t the quickest, but overall it was okay."
"we had lunch here on the day we arrived in assen. the food was nice and the service fairly slow, but then it was very busy. we returned for dinner on our final night in assen. this turned out to be a mistake. the food was nice (especially the ribs, the fish & chips were fairly boring) but the service was terrible! we had been waiting about 40 minutes for our food when i managed to catch a member of staff’s eye. she quickly disappeared round the corner and i heard her saying ‘dat meen je niet!’ she then went to a colleague. they conferred, looked at us, looked at a mobile phone and then she came over to say that the kitchen were working on our food, but that because it was taking so long she’d like to offer us each a free drink. i suspect that somehow our order hadn’t made it to the kitchen. when our food finally arrived, it was nice although i have no idea what was ‘oer’ about the oerfrieten. after our main course, we ordered a coffee and a mint tea. the coffee came without milk. the waiter would not believe this and my partner had to stir the coffee to prove this. my tea came without any fresh mint even though i’d ordered a fresh mint tea. the waiter did change my tea for a proper fresh mint one, but never brought my partner the milk that he’d promised to brin "
the title summarizes it. staff was friendly and there was some variety to the menu but it wasnt exceptional.
food was ok  but we waited 2 hours for it. if you are not hungry you can go there otherwise i don’t recommend it
"i visited this restaurant with a colleague. i travel all over the world and always use indian restaurants as i can normally get good food as i am vegan. this restaurant had lots of options available to us. . from the start the restaurant supplied the wrong starters which we overlooked. however there main course was the most bland, un-appetising indian food i have ever eaten anywhere. the vegetables were either tinned or frozen, supplied with no sauce and so bad i like my colleague left over half our meal uneaten. even when i complained to what i presumed to be either the owner or manager i was met with a blank stare and she walked away. no effort was made to correct things or at least find out more. in fact all the staff then suddenly found something else to do rather than visit our table. we paid the bill in full and left. poor show for no reason. there were other in the restaurant t the same time who also complained."
"we had good experiences with other restaurants with indian style cooking. perhaps those spoiled our taste? at new delhi resto, they serve good foods but it never gives you a sense of something special - like we had before at ganga in groningen. the sitar music is not too loud still a little annoying. when paying was at hand, the personal had a lot of difficulty to find out what we had and composing the end-bill (cheque in us-english). it is not expensive at all, still we feel that this is not a place worth driving 40 minutes for, unfortunately."
nice setting and friendly staff. reasonable nw european menu with good food quality and reasonable portions.
"this restaurant has a very nice location with a pretty terrace. however, the service is terrible. we arrived and were ignored. we were finally offered something to drink, but failed totally to get a menu to order food. there were enough staff, they just seems dis-interested. after about 20 minutes, we decided to go elsewhere."
we came for an early diner.  the service is good and quick. the food self is good though its a small portion.
"it was a beautiful boat, pancakes was... ok? but the service was poor. we were the only guest at the time and the staff ignored us for a ling time, and took a break (everyone had lunch at the same time). the pancakes was tasteless and very expensive. fun to do once, but not going back."
"we started off nicely with croquettes that we shared. they also have some nice local beers that go along with it. main course was very good (see photos). maybe the mushroom sauce could have a little bit more mushroom, though. but then came dessert: it seemed as if no effort was put into this at all. the ice cream tasted artificial, the cream was clearly from a canister, and the brownie wasnt really a brownie but 4 tiny pieces of cake hidden beneath large mounds of non-fresh cream. a pity: these desserts didnt do the mains and the friendly staff any justice."
"tasteless main dish, uninspired dessert, prices much too high compared to quality. disappointing....."
"lovely ambiance from the inside and the outside. but the coffee they serve is necessary from a machine, and they have the same teabags as in the supermarket thats a shame. they could do much better with a little more effort. furthermore, service is ok and they offer lovely cakes. we did not have lunch or dinner so can not comment on that."
"we could not find a menu online (we made photos of starters, mains and desserts) so it was a surprise. turned out to be quite good. we had drentsche kost which was simple but so nice, and a fish stew. apparently it was busy because it took some time to get our food. overall an okay restaurant with simple and slightly overpriced but honest food."
"we just had a coffee break here and for as far as i can tell its a good place to have a cup of coffee and a cake. personally i wouldnt do a lunch here, there are much nicer places."
"we arrived around 7:15 and there were only 3 other tables occupied, so it wasnt busy. our order was very simple. we each had the soup of the day (goulash) 6.25€, and salad 9.75€. we waited over 35 minutes for our food to arrive, and when it did, the soup was cold. really? you make us wait that long and then serve cold soup? we sent it back, and i think the cook was making a point because when it returned, it was boiling. and who knows what else it may have had in it by then... our wine portion was maybe slightly over 3 ounces. never once during our 1.5 hours there did the waitress return to see if we would like anything else to drink. in summary - poor service, mediocre food, and high prices = terrible value. dont waste your time or money at this place."
"went there for a drink and snack, waitresses very friendly and correct! ordered nacho with guacemole, it came disappointing, hiddious! guacemole came out of a tin, processed rubbish! never seen this before. the ladies toilets stunk. definitely need a good cleanu "
"good place to go for a drink. de brasserie had a central location in emmen, friendly waiters and a lot of beers to chose from."
"ill qualify this review first by saying im irish with a dutch husband well versed in all things irish and particularly fond of a pub of the irish inclination. after moving to emmen we were quite excited to find a local irish pub. so the husband and myself headed out one evening. firstly, the staff are great. friendly, helpful and around just the right amount of time. full marks. waiting staff, these stars are for yo "

"the food is not well cooked, very few dishes. last time i ate raw potatoes and a disgusting cake. better eat in another place."
visited la place this afternoon 
"hardly any selection of food out to choose from, particularly they did not keep sandwich dishes full for example. also empty bowls on display looks scrappy and ugly and very uninviting. plus the range of food was less than in other la place places. we left and went elsewhere. what a massive disappointment."
"went here on a bust sunday afternoon. ordered the salmon dish (which was fresh out the oven). the salmon was cold and not ready yet. very under. it came with grilled vegetables. they were black and cold aswell. wouldnt recommend it. the fries were nice, but that was about it. juices were good. "
we had fish and chips and chicken saté. nice lunch with great portion. the cantine looks nice and spacious. beer and wine could have been colder.
we went there for a lunch for the two of us. we had a tabel on the terrace with a view on the fuel station. the furniture on the terrace was very outdated. we had a very simple lunch. a drink and a bun/sandwich. however even this bun and sandwich turnde out to be cumbersome. my club sandwich a standard dish appeared to be different at haje. see photograph. also the wite bread ordered came out as an italian bun. therefore not te best performance for haje.

"the menus are not in english, but that is ok. what i don’t think is ok is having a waitress that doesn’t help you find out what you want; asking for fresh bread with butter a side and getting roasts and butte "
terrible service. rude with no smile. didn’t allow us to order take out from the restaurant or even to see a menu.  charge money for using the restroom ‘  no vegetarian options.
"this is not fine dining but you can get a decent meal! i had a steak which was oke, the vegetables and potatoes were nice. one of the better highway restaurants that i have been in. they had a busy night, i could tell, but were still quick and friendly. "
"on my way to friesland, i did pass this restaurant. a had a break for a coffee, so i went to have. i was struck by the interieur which was outdated. a grey old spoor restaurant. while the service was rather unfriendly. i asked for the wifi code, while a got a reply that there was non and the wifi is rather slow and the service suffers from this too."
"this is my first highway restaurant review. in general i try to avoid these places as most times they are overly expensive, low quality and not really fresh made stuff. often i immediately lose my apetite when i enter such a place. haje is a bit different. with several locations they intent to provide more a restaurant look and feel. waiters that come to your table for the food and drinks etc. most important the food is prepared per dish in the kitchen and less, at least for the eye, pre-made and pre-cooked food. ok the prices are still a bit higher compared what you perhaps would have paid on a regular location but at least the quality and feeling are better than other highway restaurants that are located next to a gas station. quality, portion and pricewise to compare with van der valk motel, hotel and restaurant chain. that said some of these haje restaurants do offer a kind of hotel facility in case you dont want to drive further but also dont want to sleep in the car. maybe useful to know when you had some more wine or beer and makes driving more of a stupid idea. at haje you ll be at a good place. quality wise i think they really could improve without having to raise the prices but increase the customer satisfaction and makes it even a better place. three stars it is sti "
"we didnt expect good food from the resto near highway. we ordered chicken and cheese tortilla, it was delicious. we enjoyed our quick stop at hajé."
"just dont go to this sh*thole  restaurant. brutal staff and very bad service. almost waited 1,5 hour for our food and after all the staff told us if you dont want you can leave!"
"we (party of three) arrived on a saturday at 6 oclock at the restaurant. we ordered wine, which quickly arrived, as did the menu booklet. after 30 minutes we managed to order water, starters and mean dishes. after 1 hour we started to ask how long it would take for the starters and water to arrive. the cook is busy with it. after one more hour: still nothing to eat. somehow the order did not arrive at the kitchen. after three hours: still nothing to eat. we also asked about the water (should be no problem, we thought). the waitress literally said : the water should be made first. then after 3 hours and 20 minutes the food arrived. mine was cold, the food of my friends was bad. afterwards, when paying, i asked the manager about what happened. computer failure, too many customers. i asked : is there anything to compensate for the bad experience. her question was: are you from here, lelystad? i said no. if you had said yes you would have got a free diner for two. i had to correct the bill. apparently the orders did arrive the billing site of this restaurant. on the bill were a bottle of wine (instead of a smaller carafe), two bottles of water for € 11 in total (which never arrived!) and one starter too many. i payed, without saying goodbye."
"nice welcome with shot of ouzo. food was delicious. cheesecake was great. staffs were nice but service was quite slow as we saw couple guests walked to staffs and complained. also, they served not-at-all cold beer (around 20c) and that really disappointed us."
"visited with couple of friends on rather rainy sunday. the interior gives very greek feeling, also the food includes some traditional dishes with greek twist. we have waited longer than i expected for the food (4 people) but it was good. however, the service was slow and not so helpful. "
the service in this resataurant is the worst i have ever seen. the staff is friendly but does not see the customer when they need something. i asked for some extra mayonese and it took them 15 minutes to get it to the table. after the starter it took the staff 30 minutes to come and get the plates. after a few minutes the french fries arrived without the main course. i would not go to this restaurant ever again. its too bad because the location is great. but enough restaurants there.
"we had arabic souvlaki,,, they food was not very prepared,, was very expensive food,, and they didnt give us a lot food.."
"food was very good. service was pretty good. they let themselves down by requiring cash , no visa accepted. this is unacceptable when trying to attract a captive international clientele in batavia haven - its not as if we could go anywhere else other than batavia haven ....... disappointing."
the cake and drinks were fine. due to corona the restaurant took strict arrangements for the customers e.g. disinfecting hands when entering the restaurant as well as before and after the toilet visit. however visiting employees hugged the working staff in the restaurant! this is unbelievable!
you enter the restaurant on a saturday lunch. plates and glasses not removed on every tables. you remove everything yourself and then you have to wait for a non customer oriented waitress. she cant take your order. leave you hanging. finally it comes and food is average and quite expensive. 6 to 8 euros per bagel. avoid!
"ive been to bagels and beans before and really enjoyed it, but today i went there with a friend and it was really unsatisfacto "
"the food was extremly spicy, uneatable, most of the dishes were uncooked and the meat had a very big hair in it. the staff was also rude and handled the situation poorly, was the worst experience i ever had in a restaurant."
"good smiling and swift service cannot hide the fact the cook/chef has but a cursory idea about korean cuisine. the kimchi was just vinagered to death, the bulgogi made in the kitchen (not on your table) was a mess of lukewarm beef with salted brine sau "
"it is a great location, especially during a sunny day, there are outdoor and indoor options. however, the food is very average dutch cuisine, nothing spectacular."
"restaurant nice in many ways, but don’t order the pancakes. nothing fluffy, but chewy and rubbery, doughy on the inside and burned on the outside. i commented on it to the staff who took my plate away, together with the plates from a different table, also with more than half of the pancakes left. “i’ll tell the chef” was the reaction, no excuse or offer to give me something else to eat."
the location is great and people working here have high energy.  the food is decent enough but portions are very small.
we came here for dinner....after a 50min wait our food came out overcooked and unable to eat for 30min due to extremely oven warn....when informing the waitress she got very offensive and rude...feedback is the breakfast for champions...listen to costumers and act accordingly..it may be useful for your busin 
"food was overheated by keeping most plates 30min in an oven after cooking, till final plate was ready. only final plate was worth eating, the rest was not worth putting into your mouth. feedback from waitress...if it’s not black it’s fine...so gave up on this place. everyone can have an off day when it’s busy, but then you need to stand up or correct your issues, not refuse to listen."
"we had dinner here, it was okay,not great. had the nachos as a starter,missed sour cream and guacamole with it. ordered the burrito with beef,beef was nice,it was a little dry,just missed something. margaritas were nice. restaurant needs some real latin flavors."
"to persons, dinner on a wednesda "
"a good restaurant in the middle of leeuwarden. we went as a group of five. the service was good and the food was filling. quite large dishes. its not fine cuisine. however, it is mexican. i would return when next i visit that part of the netherlands."
"the final verdict after spending a family evening with 8 persons at yucatan in leeuwarden is that it was just average on every level, welcome, service, food and temperature. the place was pretty much packed on a nice saturday evening and apparantly has no air-conditioning. we decided to skip deserts and coffees because the restaurant was simply cooking. in my goodbye i apologised for not staying longer and said it was too hot for us all, the answer was: enjoy te rest of your evening. food was average and is served on piping hot plates which does no favour to the (fresh) salad in the middle of the dish. ever had lukewarm salad? not very nice. the food only pretends to be mexican and is bland and boring in taste. years back this place was a french bistro, i believe they should go back to that atmosphere and kitchen."
"we had a reservation for two persons. the reservation was confirmed by the restaurant via email. when we arrived, we were told that they were closing because the night was not so busy."
"the two stars are for the staff. nice people who like to serve. but the essence of a restaurant is, of course, in the food. to be honest, i wouldnt serve it in an end-of-life clinic. heres the analys "
the food was average not good/not bad but the worst was that we had to wait for more than one hour for the food. the staff didnt ask if we want to have more drinks after they served one round. we will not go there again.
"this restaurant is located quite near the centre of leeuwarden and is really close to the blokhuispoort, which is worth a visit. inside, there is quite a nice atmosphere and there is even a play area for the children. we went here for brunch and got some nice bread with a lot of topping options. the bread-topping ratio was a bit off, we ended up having way too many toppings for the amount of bread we received. we also got mustard soup and beef croquettes, which frankly, i thought were rather odd items for a brunch. the waiter who served us was quite friendly and the quality of the food was ok for the price we paid."
"my friends and i visited there at the end of oct. we were 4 people, ordering 3 salads and 4 main courses. they had a really tasty salad over there, and the portion was big, which was out of our expectation. but since we also ordered the main courses, in the end it was too much for us. for the salad, we ordered the carpaccio, shrimp tatar, & grilled mix vegetable, these were really tasty. for the main course, i ordered the duck, the meat was okay, but the sauces was a bit salty for me. since i cant eat too salty foodstuff. but in general, we had a nice time over there. the dinning environment was cozy~ suitable for friends chat."
"as always on my visits to the netherlands this pub/ eetcafe is a regular stop. excellent beer, very friendly staff and a very welcome terrace during this heatwave. totally recommendable"
"rude staff, over-priced and less than average food quality. wont be spending my money there again. they just get by because of the location."
"the restaurant and the outdoor cafe is a good looking place. the atmosphere is good. the service is good as well, considering the labor problems in the hospitality business, the service was really good...... minor thing: why can a guest not pay a tip with the final pin payment?? it was a huge problem (staff did not kno "
the location of fellini is one of the great things of this spot. you can easily find your way to a table and have a cup of coffee. also a great spot for lunch and dinner. enjoy the sun with a great view after a day of shopping in leeuwarden.
"we ordered cappuchinos which were good, an uitsmijter and a tuna panini volleerde by mint tea.  the service was quick and the waitress friendly.  the place has its charm  for a monday, it became busy.  worth a visit."
"fellini city lounge is nicely en centrally located in leeuwarden, quite close to the fries museum. at evenings they serve pizza and italian food, but also fish. we had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks, which is off course much too long. these things can happen, but as i read this also in other reviews, it is not an incident."
"the place is located in the city centre of leeuwarden and it is mainly a touristic place. overall, the service is good even if they do not speak english well.. i asked for an hamburger with chicken and it arrived 1 hour late and in it where eggs, onion, maionees and other things that where not in the men "
"had lunch at fellini city lounge with a company of 17 people after visiting the fries museum. service was efficient and friendly, we received our order quite soon. the food was delicious, large portions, but a lot of récola and salad and very little chicken or prawns (depending on the order). quite some of us had this comment. nevertheless, considering the nice location and friendly service i consider this good value for money."
"not impressed.  the food was ok, but the prices were too high for the sandwiches, mostly bread.  extremely slow service.  big outdoor terrace."
"after we waited 15 minutes we decided to move to a restaurant next door, the burgemeester van napels, there we had prompt service and good food."
"visited here with 3 other people, we all wanted a tasty dish of pasta, unfortunately as it had just gone 9pm we were told we could only have pizza. i tried ordering a spaghetti bolognese pizza, but this didnt work. the pizza i had was ok, but i wanted pasta!"
"the cafe was on our to-do list for our visit in leeuwarden. once we got the menu, we asked for some translation help since it was not in english. we ordered the panini hawai and the clubburger fellini. both were good but the fries were average. service overall was very good but not great since the waitress did the minimum effort when translati "
we stopped in the town square in leeuwarden and spotted this place for lunch - good move! plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and a good lunch menu. we kept it to a light lunch (mainly paninis) and the food was excellent - light and fresh. service was fast and friendly even through the lunch rush was in full swing. coffee was good too.
"the menu looks promising, the descriptions enticing, but unfortunately... the meatballs were re-heated in the microwave and some were boiling hot, others were cold and disintegrating. not an experience we would care to repeat."
"went there on a saturday afternoon because of mandatory closing time at 17.00.  food was ok, but service was difficult. gave us the wrong wine (white instead of a red). starters were better than than dinner. portions too big and overall not value for money."
"in case you use the parking garage below the wilhelminaplein you enter the street level directly at this location of doppio, a sort of an italian coffee house with entrances on both sides of the restaurant. in this way they can keep both doors open and get some good air circulation in their building which is always good in corona-times. we ordered a coffee to start with and then a small lunch dish. both were served quickly and with good distance so this was reassuring being our first visit to a restaurant on out short break to leeuwarden. tables were also far away from each other and we never felt unsafe here. the lunch was ok and value for money so we were satisfied. and from here you can visit the center of leeuwarden easily while there is also a large terrace to sit outside on the wilhelminaplein."
cute location on the square. service is friendly but way too slow. coffee was good but arrived barely warm. will try again.
i just went here with my girlfriend. it was around 1 oclock and very quiet. we orderd some food and coffee. the coffee was very good! the food was not very much especially for the price. and we had to wait quite lon 
"yes, you can order a lot of tapas here. and yes, some them are great (e.g., spare ribs!). but the pace is soooo slow. we got our first order at the end of the evening. the all-you-can-eat means literally you can eat all you want, but its all about the drinks. even the drinks were not served very quickly. all in all a disappointing experience. but hey: try it for yourselves!"
"this restaurant is located in the centre of leeuwarden, so has a nice view if you sit outside. i would recommend sitting outside, because inside is cramped, dark and extremely warm. the food was ok, there was quite a lot of variety, but the quality really varied per dish. sometimes the dishes came really quickly, and some took half an hour! this makes it hard to predict exactly how much time you will spend at the restaurant. the staff was friendly and the concept of all you can eat tapas is a good one, so all in all an ok restaurant."
"the food was okay, lots of variety but not very good taste. you pay way too much for what you get. was kind of dissapointed.."
"i just had the worst pizza ever. in a place that was recommended as serving the best pizza in town. perhaps they have good ones but the frutti di mare i tried had the worst bottom i have ever had. so soggy it was as if there was pasta carrying the filling. that filling consisted of mussels, shrimps, tuna and perhaps other things. too much too salty. deeply disappointing. be cautioned."
"not sure what we missed, nice people and a very cosy restaurant. pizzas not too bad, definitely not that great, pasta was too dry, sauce too thick, way too much pasta. the rest of the family ate their dishes but i just couldn’t eat much of my marinara pasta, sauce too thick & dry, tiny shrimps, tuna all mushed up in the sauce, like a mashed up lasagna. mine was really bad."
"staff was friendly, helpful, and it was very busy. the food was good, they serve a wide range of pancakes from savory to sweet. everyone should find a suitable flavour. unfortunately i am celiac and there was literally nothing i could have, everyone else was really happy so it must be great. we went with a group of 20 and have been seated separately which is due the form of the restaurant which is the only minus point i would give. overall a lovely dining experience and for those who want to try a typical dutch panekoeken it is the place to be as it is located on a boat and the view onto the water makes it perfect. it basically looks like a pirate ship from the inside so really cool. i would highly recommend it."
loved the idea of being on ship and surroundings authentic.  nice photo opportunities on board.  found menu hard to understand and quite expensive.
"the pancake ship is a land mark here in leeuwarden. it is a charming place and the staff always very nice. we try to take all our guests at least once. however, this last time i felt the food quality was not as good as usual. (been going here over the last 3 years). but will give them another try in a week with more guests. it is just a really fun experience being on a ship that used to ply the canals of friesland."
"had dinner at eindeloos with family. it’s okay, but not that great as many claim it is. personally i do not like the chef to decide what i have to eat. like to be in control of what i want to taste. was okay. but there are much better places around the area. uses curry in the strangest way. only thing that was pretty okay was the shrimp which seems to be the chefs specialty. "
"i visited this restaurant in febuary of 2015, as it had been reccommended so vastly. even though most reviews are so positive i found the experience to be dissapointing. a set menu of a certain amount of dishes (you do have choice in how many) with some say in what ingredients you would prefer not to have. the food was nice but not special, the meat main course being better than the fish before that. the wait for the food was long. in good company this should not matter too much but even for us 3+ hours for 8 courses was too long. the portions of the first dishes were small, and so was the bread portion. when asking for more bread this was responded to positively, yet we never received it. this happened again the second time, and the third. in a restaurant with maybe 15? tables of which only about 5/6 were occupied this should not be the case. if i recall correctly there were even two waiters, one of them being supervisory to the other. after maybe 45 minutes and multiple times of asking we received the bread which we later had to pay f "
"we had dinner in this restaurant as it was recommended as being one of the best in friesland and we had a meeting with someone. we were sorry not going somewhere else. i must admit that the quality of the food was pretty ok but i expected more of it. no wow factor, just good food. not michelin standard as mentioned by some other reviewers. we ordered a five course menu (it is a surprise menu but you can mention what you dont like). the service however was not very good. we had 2 amuses (not my taste) within a few minutes and then nearly 1 1/2 hours wait till we had the first course. as we had to wait that long we ordered some extra bread, they forgot to bring it and we had to ask 3 times, after about half an hour we finally got the bread, but surprise they charged us € 5 for it we found out later on the bill. as we did spent nearly € 300 i think it is rediculous to charge for a bit of extra bre "
"the atmosphere is welcoming, calming, quiet, like stepping back in time. the waitstaff were pleasant and prompt. the beer was ice cold. ordered several dishes including babi pangang, foe yong hai, and loempia. servings are ample, enough to share. some meals may have been prepared earlier as there was a distinct lack of fresh spices and herbs in the dishes. leeuwarden has several grocery stores that offer a wide range of imported spices and herbs. one of the stores, toko anphuc, is less than 5 minutes walk away from the restaurant and offers an extensive selection of fresh herbs and spices that would be a quick way for the kitchen to elevate the meal(s). based on reviews of others i really wanted to give the restaurant a 5 star rating but now reluctantly settle for 3."
"i can honestly say this was the worst meal we have had in a very long time. the starters were vile, tasteless and rubbery, and no one could bring themselves to admit how horrible they truly were. once the main courses arrived we tasted and they did not make it to our plates. normally i will not accept bad food, on this occasion i did not know where to start. we paid for our meal and left it all on table, without being questioned by the staff for our quick exit. hugely disappointed and will not be returning due to the stomach turning food. "
we have been here for three times now since 2020. the food is absolutely delicious (5 stars) but unfortunately the waiting times reduce the experience to 2 stars every time. waiting for over 1 hour and 15 minutes for our diner every time…
"nan was nog as nice as others buy the good was good. vindaloo was the hottest ever, to much. sag alloo was nicely spiced."
food choice was not too bad but service was a bit hit and miss. its great that they obviously employ local students as the waitresses but a bit more training would help. i had to open the wine as the waitress who served us had not used a corkscrew before. they also had a limited knowledge of the food being served but everything was done with a smile which helped. food was okay but not truly authentic. obviously popular with locals as it was busy for an early midweek evening. nice atmosphere but no real outstanding dishes. not too disappointed and i am sure some of the specials ( mainly meat options) would be fine for most non-vegetarians. overall experience was okay.
"we tried out jamuna tonight and were really disappointed. the food was tasteless and boring. the lamb biriyani turned out to be pulao and the spinach lamb curry can easily be given a miss. i know the standards of food drop considerably when one is away from home(india/uk), however jamuna was an embarrassment. the one aspect where jamuna scores really high is the service. very well trained, friendly staff. its a shame as we have recently moved to leeuwarden and expected this place to be our regular stop."
"hi, this week we had dinner after work. it was 3 people and two of us got intoxicated. we reported the situation to the restaurant. regards"
we excitingly made a reservation for an anniversary dinner at 19.00 (email confirmation from restaurant). when we arrived we were received by closed and locked doors. we tried calling the restaurant but no one picked up. on their website it said that they were ope 
"on the plusside the cafe has a great location on the canal. but when we went there it took 45 minutes to get drinks and 2 hours to get something to eat. and they basically just serve sandwiches and other light meals. maybe they had a bad day, but i wouldnt choose this place if i didnt have alot of time to spend waiting..."
"because i hadn’t seen my friend for a while, we decided to go for a high tea and catch u "
"i am a big fan of eggplant and mashrooms, but this was dissapointing. nevertheless i really enjoyed the mossels, really tasty. the location is ok, i supose in summer and when it is sunny it is more apreciable, but in the night adds no value. the stuff was polite, and efificient. i would not say the score is bad but a bit under average, i expected much more."
food is not real indonesian. it has a dutch twist. not prepared with fresh ha good indonesian meal. so not a  second time for me
"it looked great at the menu list, but the list is changed and the choice is poor and we were still hungry afterwards. we had courgette pasta, which turned out to be a salad. we were dissapointed. we went to the fishshop in de oude kerkstraat and ate some good sushis for 6 euro. we recommend you to do the same."
still good coffee and good sandwiches. the place is absolutely clean and lovely decorated. i definitely recommend it if you want to enjoy a nice coffee thats not filter coffee ...

"great location, great staffs, and nice food. from 10 tapas menus i ordered, 3 are okay, 3 are good, 4 are really good :).  tips: i found it was extremely crowded on thursday & during weekend."
"on arriving for a single seat i wasn’t offered a choice but rather bluntly told to sit inside on a lovely evening. perhaps i should have been more vocal. i ordered an alcoholic drink and asked for some tap water. i was told they “don’t have tap water” only bottled water at 3euros. at this point i explained i needed water to eat food with and was told i could get one glass. the food was fine, and i could see native dutch speakers getting warmer service than me. i did get complementary popadoms, however i would have appreciated more water. anyway the tip they did not received would have been a lot more than three euros. another local eatery nearby was happy to give me a pint of water free. why did i get upset over water? i think it was the manner - when you go out to eat it’s about the whole experience, which doesn’t encourage me to go back when i’m there in business again."
if you are looking for a good dining experience in apeldoorn its time to look elsewhere 
"not too much to say.....the service was friendly....but the food was not very hot and very bland, hardly any flavours in any of the 4 dishes we ordered. wont be returning."
the manager has an aggressive and impatient attitude which i took exception too. i queried why there were no onions with the starters and he reminded me i was in the netherlands and not england. i decided to leave and he called me an idiot. i’m proud to say i didn’t knock his head off but needless to say i wouldn’t recommend this restaurant.
"while staying in hoenderloo on the hoge veluwe national park we decided to try the indian cuisine in nearby apeldoorn. the restaurant did not live up to expectations though, that were highly strung because of the website promising authentic indian cuisine. the restaurant was not very clean and in fact smelled rather strongly, and alas not of indian food but probably of old baking fat. the personnel was friendly but rather clumsy, bringing the wrong wine. the food was not very tasty, as we are used to from earlier experience with really good indians - like swaat in kampen or mayur kitchen and gandhi in zwolle. prices were average. all in all a dissappointing experience, maybe the more because they presented themselves on the internet as really good. "
it definitly is a nice bar with a good seating area in the car-free street. what did strike us though is that staff and people did not keep the necessary social distance.
get your sh*t together b 
"together with some friends we tried this place, well thats once. food came out frozen out of the microwave, and were glad that we didnt got sick."
"this was our first repeat visit since discovering la cubanita a few years ago. unfortunately, nothing has changed for the bett "
"good restaurant, we had de 5 course menu and it was very enjoyably and for 32,50 euros, our only complaint was that we sat near the open kitchen, and we smelled everything , also meat that had been burned,"
"i was dining here with my dad, the place itself looks good, but the staff is very young and not everyone knows what theyre serving. we chose the 5 plate surprise menu of which the first an second course were amazing but the main dish very blend. we told the waiter who would discuss it further with his chef. he never got back to us. anyway its an ok place i you go without expectations. "
it is located a bit off the center of the charming city of apeldoor 
were here for the third time. the weather was beautiful and we had a with rush mats protected spot outdoors. we sat in a corner surrounded by cobwebs. the starter and main course we found formidable bad. only the coffee was good to drink.
"it is an old fashion and old representation restaurant. the ambience is not really appealing and so is the buffet. vietnam cuisine is one of my favourite because their unique taste and fresh ingredients. but you do not see and find on their buffet selection foods - it is dull. fortunately it has open kitchen for grill, pho (soup) & banh xeo (vietnam pancake). the pancake is superb, soup is oke and the grill is o "
"hard to judge. dont go there for fine food. dont feel embarassed if youre wearing muddy boots after a rainy walk in the woods. yes: bring your dog. anything goes at de hamer and maybe thats why can be a busy place with standing room only. whenever i visit apeldoorn i go there for a couple of drinks, kroketten or -in winter and if im lucky- homemade peasoup (snert for insiders) made by a friendly lady who once owned the areas best butchers shop. yum "
"after waiting 15 minutes we could finally order a bottle of champagne.   after waiting an other 15 minutes we left, without ever having seen any champagne.   worthless service."
previously i was a regular visitor of martins. last time about one year ago. today i had a lunch at martins again. to my surprise the food is much too expensive for what is being served: i had to pay 58 euro’s for two persons incl 1 glass of wine each. staff is not really friendly. room for improvement.
did the heat wave effect the staff?the hottest day inthe netherlands ever! the food was so so and the staff were pleasant but there is lack of attention to detail . the mackerel salad was not what it could have been and indeed the lettuce was covered with the dirt from its growing bed! without an apology but recognition of the “blunder” i was pleasantly surprised to see the deduction of that meal on the bill. a lot to be picked up on in our opinion.
"the place is very loud, and food is just ok. if you are ok with that, you will probably be fine. good place for a snack before going out on saturday night. this is the 4th time i have been there as i wanted to get them another chance. there was always something wrong with the food. this time their burata is/was very bad. last time rissoto was sticky, before that the cream (foam) on surf and turf was off... i like that they offer a nice selection of wine per glass, just too bad that the food is not just a notch better. still some room for improvement."
cosy and darkish bar/restaurant. not a pub. beer selection is very poor. 6 in total and bottled only.... only 3 affligem are worth the drink.... so dont go there if youre a beer fan.
got here with a voucher of vakantieveilingen. three course menu. as starter we had the fungi and carpacio both very tasty. we both enjoyed the main salmon course with fries and salat. we finished with ice and baklava. serving staff is a bit slow and the restaurant is a bit on the sober side. also the marktstraat is not the prettiest street of apeldoorn. good value for money though!
"nice place, not a huge selection on the menu but enough for a nice lunch. went there with my mother and they were willing to change her selection so she could eat it more easily as shes handicapped."
after a lovely day all around the apenheul monkey enclosure. we decided to eat lunch. we both ordered a beef burger. i cut mine in half to see red raw meat and it was stone cold. sent it back to kitchen and it came back to me again raw. don’t waste your money here. far to expensive.
"actually, this is a nice place in a nice setting on the edge of a park, overlooking a lake. more of a nice lunch venue than a dinner setting, with a pleasant terrace if the weather is fi "
"nice place for coffee or lunch, but not for dinner. great location, nice vuews, good service if not too busy."
visited after a day of apenheul. tries to be haute cuisine and comes very close. could be bigger portions for these prices.
we called to book and were told that we could reach without any problem: once we arrived the lady told us that she had received no call and that there was no availability. quite shocking to receive such rudeness after having travelled to reach the place.

"we booked a “wild” menu (5 coarses) to celebrate the season, knowing a lot of game is available on the veluwe. the result was a bit disappointing however as if the cook still was in summertime spirits. also the wine combinations were pretty average, and for one dish even horrible (wine far too sweet for the rather sour (mustard) tasting dish). all ended up in a too high price/quality ratio. we have had better experiences for even lower prices."

"fantastic meal at this establishment, but the hotel room was rather disappointing - not enough attention to detail and too dark.  lights broken, decor a bit tatty.  i would eat here again, but not stay."
"i went here for dinner on my birthday. the place looks nice, although it has no windows. we were seated at the small 2-person tables, which were too close together for our taste. esp. when all were empty, why seat another couple at the table next to us and not start at the other end. i could literally hear their entire conversation.... furthermore, the couch i was sitting on was very uncomfortable due to its depth. the menu offers a nice selection, but prices are at the higher range. the food was good and nicely presented."
"we were at the restaurant probably at the wrong moment. quite a lot of people were in the restaurant. service remained quick but little of other than bringing and taking the food away. food was ok, but not special. after diner it was nice to sit outside"

"busy evening and the service was poor and slow. when we finally got the orders, they were fine, but ..."
"nice restaurant and atmosphere, the service was good. although i did not understand why the food was served by waiters wearing black gloves! i ordered a carpaccio as a main dish, the plate was brought to the table with the black gloves waiter. it was a enormous plate carpaccio (i thought), disappointing was that most of the plate was green salad with a small portion of carpaccio below. maybe next time i have to try something else!"
"the food was just excellent and the athmosphere cosy. but one of the female servants was a misplaced one. she was not a part of our (guests) dinner, but she acted as if! we were there to evenings, but no more!"
"waited 45 minutes to get uncooked burgers. very unfortunate. the staff was kind enough to give us our drinks for free, due to the mishap, but how hard can it be to make a burger with minced meat."
"we just randomly chose this restaurant for dinner one evening, without knowing what to expect. we were pleasantly surprised by the tasty food and wine (however i am no wine expert). the service was ok, staff was friendly but also clumsy at times. but nothing too bad. i wouldn’t necessary go back, just because i found it a bit overpriced. but everything else was ok. "
the taste was all over the place. everything was super sweet and not exactly like what it called. compare with the price is bit much.
"normally i love to go to this restaurant because foods are teste good. i like foods there but i don’t really like the owner. i can’t even choose where i wanna sit and once i went there with a friend he not even say hi or anything. he just said that he can’t take orders anymore because he have to make 7 take away orders. never saw this before in my life. but finally i try to not think about it. today i went there with my boyfriend. i ordered 2 noodles, 2 drink, and chikuwa. after that i only got my 2 noodles and 3 drinks ( i ordered 1 drink but i told him oh no not this one this one. i think he doesn’t understand that i changed to another drink ) i told him i didn’t ordered this one. i changed to another one. he not even said anything just walk away with his mad face. i also didn’t even have my chikuwa the one that i have ordered... really!? need to improve. if i didn’t check what i have to pay before i pay i probably have to pay more money for a drink that i haven’t ordered. i don’t know if i want to come here again or not."

"only had an hour before we had to catch train so popped into de beren near the station. tasty burgers, chunky chips and quick and friendly service."
"we went here for a quick late afternoon meal (4pm). the restaurant wasnt full and we gave our choices quickly. the goulash soup came quickly, which wasnt too bad by the way. then we waited 35 minutes for two burger menus. we ordered american bbq burger and the berenburger classic. while the former was very tasty, the latter was disgusting, with the burger too well-done for my taste. the menus came with fries and salad. they were generous with the fries but the salad was really dry and disgusting. i suggest they are better off serving a fresh tomato and some slices of cucumber as salad."

the food menu is extensive but the actual taste is pretty average. i missed the punch of a good mexican dinner. all the sauces tasted as if they came from a jar and not freshly made. they served normal cream and not sour cream which was a surprise. service was good and prompt. all in all efficient but not the most gourmet evening.
"used to be an agreable venue, uncomplicated, friendly priced. januari 2019 renovaties started, nothing announced regarding the plans/concepts for the future."
"the service was really good , the lady behing the bar very nice . i cant complement enough. just walked in off the street with a friend . the food was extremely basic . so easy to cook but the presentation, well there is none . poorly made , poorly plated. i personally wont be back even if its free. sorry for the honest review . feel bad but you need to seriously up your game"
"we were here in august 2015. i had hamburger with fries and my bf had chili con carne. chili con carne tasted pretty good but my hamburger wasnt anything special. we also had to wait a long time to first get a table, get the food and to pay for the food. because of pretty bad service and food nothing special i would not come back here if i visit arnhem again."
i know this restaurant for years but hadnt been there is some time. i was disappointed with the food. the service and ambiance were fine but the food let it down. sauces didnt taste like they were made with fresh ingredients such as sour cream which is a must for a mexican restaurant. my main course of chicken on a skewer was wrapped in a tortilla with a very sour sauce. the guacamole was also very sour. pity..... i left very disappointed. the fresh mint tea and corona beer were the highlight of this meal. such a pity for what was a good restaurant. 
"the restaurant was almost empty when we got there, so we went to some table where we wanted to sit, but we still got invited to the bar so that the waiters prepare the tables. they did this with a few more people and the bar was really small and we where basically waiting on the corridor. i dont think they did anything else, but brought some forks and knifes and we had to wait for about 5 minutes for that. anyway, we got to the table and we ordered a beef enchillada and a small size ribs portion with baked potato, two glasses of wine and water. they brought the wine, and i thought that they will also bring the water right away. it didnt happen and after 10 more minutes i asked again for the water, and after ten more minutes we also got some water. then, instead of beef we got chicken enchillada, and instead of small portion of spare ribs with baked potato, we got medium portion of spare ribs with fries. i havent ate spare ribs there before and i didnt knew what the sized mean, but i also felt that what i have in the plate is quite big for a small portion, so i asked if what i got is a small portion and not maybe a large one. the guy that got the food confirmed that it was a small portion. we ate, and when we finished we asked for the check. after about 10 minutes we asked again for the check and after about 15 more minutes we finally get the check where i found out that apparently i ate a medium portion of ribs and not a small one as i ordered. even so, we had to pay what we ate, and not what we ordered. i told the waitress all my complains and also about the waiting for the check and she started saying how there are some waiters that are sick and they are understaffed and these kind of excuses. actually, i also think they were understaffed, but i really dont see how thats my problem and not the restaurants manager probl "
"mexican food in europe has become a bit of a joke and this restaurant takes it to a point where it is no longer funny. amazing how many names you make out of the same three ingredients. but whether it was a burritto, a chimichanga, an enchillada, a taco, a fajita or a lump of indiscernible gloop, it was all pretty much the same. most tuna-like chicken ive ever encountered. maybe we should contact the wwf about a new species (although some of the other things on the plate were clearly of alien origin)."

i have been twice in this restaurant and twice i was amazed by the lack of mexican dishes in this so-called mexican restaurant. sure spanish names may help you think you are eating mexican food but take a closer look and you will realize this is really average dutch dinner with disgusting canned guacamole and ingredients that i am not even sure you can find in mexi 
"we wanted to have dinner here, but when we entered the restaurant they immediately almost literally pushed us out of the building because we brought a stroller with us for our 2 year old daughter. in an extremely rude manner we where told that strollers arent welcome in the restaurant?! not really a family-restaurant, as they pretend to be..."
"a friend of mine and me bumped into this delicious mexican restaurant after have been looking for a suitable one for hours. the interior design of the restaunrant is unforgettable, full of decoration, some real stone walls and a chimeney. we ordered two unalcoholic drinks followed by two burritos. the drinks were not so big but delicious, while burritos were massive! we actually did not finished them. more burritos were brought with rice, beans and salad. the bill is not one of the cheapest (42€), taking into consideration we took just one plate and one drink per person. but it is worth going there! ill go back for sure."
i waited for almost a hour and half. then when i got my delivery the forgot my ice tea. so i tried to call the restaurant because that was the advise from the delivery person. well the restaurant didnt pickup the the telephone three times. never eat there ever again!
"had dinner here with colleagues, being brits we generally know our way around indian food. standard offerings starters were ok our main courses lacked a bit of flavour and spice though. fairly priced, a little cramped at the table though. service ok."
will not come over again as the food was rather plain and the cloth on the table used and stained. doesnt worth of bothering
food was okay.... but... service is very poor....customers literally waving to get attention. needs fixing!  train the staff....
food was ok but when you don’t like chicken it’s a problem. the lamb was way too spicy even for someone who likes spicy. the veggies were ok and the salad was finished and not filled again too bad. little disappointed.
"i went into this restaurant when they were serving buffet. i was eating alone as away on business. service was friendly enough. unfortunately, i was disappointed by the food; there wasnt a great selection and the taste was just ok. perhaps the a la carte dishes were better but im not going to return."
"we chose the buffet menu. a modest choice of chicken and vegetable dishes. one lamb dish, no fish or other meat. mild, medium or spic "
after dinner drinks and coffee with the four of us. staff is full of pretence and annoyingly fake-jovi 
"nice place, very nice terrace, nice fingerfood, nice beer, but the wine is terrible. we tried the pinot grigio, the verdicchio and the sauvignon blanc and they all tasted like acid. this is the worst quality wine you buy in the supermarket and is a bloody shame that they sell this wine. so, if you go, drink a coke or a beer, but forget the wine!"
"food was average but served hot and quickly. the staff were very attentive and enthusiastic. no wines by the bottle available. restaurant was not as clean as it could be, same in the washrooms. we would not go back."
we have eaten here before. as usual the good was quite good but 
terrible pad thai ever not even close to pad thai is look like bakmie goreng but tasteless!! such a waste of money and time to go there.
"i went for take out and when i got home i discovered the worse uneatable phad thai koeng i ever had. no greens (spring onion), no taugé, no peanut, no taste. just noodle with egg, oil and a lost slice of carro "
"a nice place to go if you like thai food. nice place, good service and average price. i recommend for a business dinner or just to have some good spicy food!"
"so they advertise with all you can eat. so from the outside it looks quite inviting. so youre hungry. walk on. because as soon as youve decided to sit down and order anything, the waiting game starts. it takes them around 30 mins to serve you another helping of the all you can eat skewers. and they are badly cooked... i mean badly. no seasoning, burnt on the outside, tiny little quantities of meat hidden between big chomps of union. after more than two hours and forking out eur 40 per person we left hungry and frustrated. never again."
"the good points of this restaurant are the spacious outdoor seating area, free parking and the polite and prompt service of the waitresses. however, where the restaurant lets you down is with the core business, the food. the food was, in my opinion, prepared without dedication, with cheap ingredients and presented dismally. a visit only to be repeated if the order is limited to coffee. "
"we went here after our visit to burgers zoo. while we were very hungry, we did not finish our pancakes. they were to greasy and stuffy."
"nice traditional style dutch pancake restaurant. located near a great forest to walk the dog. dogs welcome too. and theres free parking and a bus stop in front. staff was very nice, one of them sang happy birthday to my mom since it was her birthday. pancakes are a bit thick for my liking but otherwise tasted nice. we tried two non-traditional ones. more than enough to fill you up! "
"the pancakes were delicious, and there is a substantial selection.  the prices were reasonable. the ambiance and decoration is pleasant, and the service (lunchtime) was quick and efficient."
"overall the experience did not live up to the ranking on tripadvisor. very mediocer food, suuuuuper salty! we had bread and aioli, breads were fine but yoguhrt with garlic and a bit of mayo isnt ailo "
"concept is great, the shared dining and the menu card looks great. staff was very helpful and kind. the only thing is that you have a brilliant concept but average execution as it would have been better if the little tapas style dishes would have been homemade. i loved the goat cheese salad & the fries with herb mayonaise but some of the dishes reminded me of the tapas selection in the supermarket (crispy duck rolls, yakitori) it would have been better if arneym would put some more effort in homemade dishes as then concept & execution would be perfect!"
nice but not surprising! large variety of choice and reasonable portions. friendly and a good option for a late lunch in the city centre. average prices.
food is nice and well presented but pricy.... the only real comment is about the ever so slow service and we do not expect a 5 minute service but waiting half an hour for two tiny rolls is way to much...
"we chose from the special 3-course-menu. choice is not exciting. however, the food is good. next time ill choose from the menu."
we had reserved a place on a saterday for java buffet at 20.00 ho 
"where to begin - i have had had food in my life, but this was from another level. we literally received our food from the microwave. we ordered and then 4 minutes later the food was on the table, even the rice was pre-heate "
tasteless and greasy dishes. hectic and disorganised service by overwhelmed students. worst rijstaffel ever…
"we had the vegetarian rijsttafel and well, yes, it was okay. average food. the veggies were definitely not freshly cut but frozen or tinned. there are many excellent indonesian restaurants in the netherlands, this one didn’t live up to our expectations."
"every time i visit the netherlands i try to eat at indonesian restaurants as they are usually good. batavia, however, was disappointing. the service was actually great and the food tasted fine, but it simply was not the kind of bursting with favour food i expect from an indonesian rijsttafel. many of the dishes tasted similar and, to be honest, ok, decent, tasty enough, but lacklustre. if back in arnhem again i would favor the thai restaurant where we had eaten the night before, where the food was bursting with flavour."
"we went for the batavia rijsttafel and were served various large portions of rice, meat and vegetables by a very friendly waiter. the way the wine was served made it clear that this was not the beverage of choice of most of the patrons. nevertheless did we spend a pleasant evening with plenty of good food."
"eat dinner here with colleagues on a business trip, large selection of set menus. food was decent and plenty of dishes, service was a little erratic but all in all ok"
ingredients are of ok quality but nothing special. the seasoning is bland. ive eaten much better indonesian food in the netherlands. the price is reasonable but given the food i would not recommend this place.
i would never eat here again the food was disgusting and we were waiting too long to be served. my partner caught a stomach bug and his lip broke out in blisters due to them serving him tap water from a bottle which was not sealed. i would recommend nobody to eat here and i have let my family and friends know not to go there.
"based on tripadvisor, had high expectations which it didnt meet. vegetable soup was quite tasty but fried snapper fish wasnt great. and was surprised the bill reached 70eu for 2 adults and 2 kids. service was good."
"the service was good and the owner really was welcoming and pleasant. having had indonesian at good places is amsterdam, utrecht,  and die hague i would say that the food was a little disappointing."
"centrally located just across the street from the railway station. rating this restaurant, is dependent of what you expect. what you will get is a good meal for a low cost, served by friendly people. if you expect a real treat - this restaurant is probably not the best choice."
"buffet setup was 2 entrees (soup and sateh) for which we had to wait 20 min each, after which we were allowed to go for the buffet. during the 90 minutes we were there, we were asked nearly ten times if we wanted to drink somethin "
we decided for this place as it was ranking 2 in arnhem. we were welcomed by friendly staff and ordered a 5 course meal for 3 people. the appetizers were not up to expectation at all. spring rolls were very tough. the main dishes were ok but noting special. doubt i will return
"on a sunday evening around 18 hr we managed to get a table in this apparently popular place. the food is ok, but not as special as the high ranking on tripadvisor suggests. next to set rice tables they offer the possibility to chose your own combination of dishes, which is a good alternative for small appetites."
it was my first time at this restaurant and the last one for sure. i have been to other indonesian restaurants before but this one was very disappointing. ive had never seen such a black chicken before and the rice was near to dark brown. they were not burned but over marinated. it was still edible but i will never recommend this restaurant.
we thought the service could be improved. more gentle and more customer is always right. we ordered lontong cap go meh and their version is pretty far from what indonesian would expect.  the nasi goreng and satay is great though.
"very nice manager; gave us a very welcome feeling. also our two children were more then welcome. this is a big plus. the service is sometimes a bit indonesian too; slightly chaotic and slow. we had a rijsttafel.....the food was ok, but not special. considering the low price, i would say that price/quality is go "
"the thing that killed it for me was the slow service. they kept us waiting for our food as they busily tidied up the restaurant at the end of the day. there was hardly anyone else there either so why the delay? a note of caution too, the stairs down to the toilets are quite steep if you have small children or you have had a few. better deals with more attentive staff elsewhere in arnhem."
"encouraged by the positive reviews, we booked here for 7.30 on the friday, and were encouraged by all outside tables being full. greeted by a staff member who in perfect english told us she was studying in the uk, and made some recommendations whilst taking drink orders, all seemed to be going well. however, it went downhill after that, mainly because of the very slow service. as recommended, we chose the batavia meal for two, with its multiple small dishes, but they took so long to come that despite the enjoyable indonesian beer, we became increasingly fed up, and the food when it did arrive wasnt that special. spring rolls and the skewers were ok, but the main dishes were not that warm, not that tasty, and rather overcooked. one of the poorer meals and experience we have had for a long time."
"we are indonesians visiting arnhem for a week and we visited batavia 3 times. so we could vouch how authentic and good their food is. despite the great food and friendly service, unfortunately we had to leave a bad review as we were completely disappointed on our last vis "
i went there together with my girlfriend for valentines day but the food was not really special. there was no wow factor.
this was my favorit restaurant in arnhem for a long time. but our last visit was more than disappointin 
"after reading the great number of laudatory reviews, i made a reservation online, but got no confirmation. we went anyway. the place was less than half full. we ordered dinner, a rijstafel...and sat waiting with the expectation of a fine meal. the waiter was extremely friendly. our drinks and chips came quickly. then we waited...and waited. finally he took our order. and we waited...and waited. forty-five(!) minutes later, our first appetizer arrived. we actually werent discouraged. the food would make up for the delay. one half-hour later, i got out of my chair to look around the restaurant. perhaps the other end of the room was crowded (no...), or there had been an accident in the kitchen (no...), or our waiter had quit his job and emigrated from the netherlands. but there he was, near the bar, carrying plates. i cornered him and inquired about our second appetizer. he actually replied by asking how long it had been since the busboy removed our previous plates. after the second appetizer, we had soup (it came promptly), and then waited for another thirty minutes for our main dishes. the yellow rice was tasty. the ten little dishes were flat and uninteresting..and a bit too salty. the fish was the worst: baked mackerel. i like mackerel. i like fishy fish. but this was beyond fishy. it tasted like it had been ripening on the doc "
no complaints other than the service being slow.  food was good.  found another indonesian restaurant in the central that was better so i would most likely not return.
"we were recommended this restaurant as a specialist indonesian one. we arrived at around 8, bearing in mind people tend to eat early in holland - the restaurant had closed by 10pm. there is an extensive offering, including at the weekend a buffet. as we had not eaten indonesian before, we decided on one of the many rijstafels, which essentially are a selection of dishes with either rice or noodles. to my taste most of the food tasted similar and unlike other asian foods was not particularly well differentiated. on discussion afterwards we wondered whether this was because we had arrived towards the end of service and were dealing with dishes that had been sitting around. total cost including a couple of glasses of wine 90 euros for three. despite good hosting, i’m not sure i’d visit again."
"i have been to this restaurant once for a dinner, expected something special since the reviews on this places are wonderful. what weve got was terrible, food was already pre-cooked, then made once again warm so my starter was over-fried. the main dish was way too sweet, not spicy at all, and cooked long before serving too. i really dont understand what made this place so popular. its nothing."
"all is in the title. if you like ribs, want to try it and are in arnhem: this is the place to go. besides service is done by very nice people in a welcoming place."
"we frequently eat out at china town in arnhem,and are generally very happy with the fo "
"the food was fairly tasty. the problem was that it took almost an hour to get our pancakes (crepes). service was not only slow, but not very friendly. meanwhile there were about ten children under age 5 running around the restaurant, back and forth to a play area and their parents at their tables. i was amazed that they didnt trip one of the servers who were carrying large platters of food. i dont know why the staff accept this misbehavior, but they brought it upon themselves by having a play area without requiring parents to be with their children in the play area. there is no gate or anything to keep children in the play area. clearly this is a restaurant for families with young children. the rest of us should go elsewhere."
we thought the pancakes were average and the kids special was disappointing. feel like it was all over priced for the experience.
"despite some negative experiences of other people, we did not have to wait a long time. within 15 minutes our pancakes were on the table, good tasting and not burnt at the bottom as i experienced in the past by other restaurants of this kind."
"we were at park de hoge veluwe and brought our own bikes, so we decided to have lunch outside of the park. we ended up at den strooper, a nice pancake house. the pancakes were good, but the service was slow and more than 3 euro for a glass of wine was kind of steep. we did have a nice lunch though and didnt need any food till dinner time."
we landed at this place because the pancake house we wanted to go to was close and we saw this place along the w 
"we had just arrived in arnhem and were desperate for a cup of coffee. the café is counter service, and the cost of two flat white coffees was a hefty €7.5 "
mams coffee arnhem has an industrial look. i like that style. but i wasnt there for the interior. several reviews made me step into this coffee bar / lunch room. i ordered an xl mams iced coffee caramel and a piece of speculaas cheeseca 
visit “mams” on a sunday for a cup of tea and a apple pie. drink came fast but had to wait quit a bit for a pie. thought it took a while because they going to heat it up. but it was still cold. the employees seems a little chaotic and stressed. don’t know why because it wasn’t that busy. lucky the drink and food are quit ok.
"i was very curious about this new place and i had big expectations but oh surprise! after 15 minutes of sitting there and looking around no body came to take my order. the place wasnt full at all!. i was completely ignored!!!! after 10 minutes of being sitting there three other guests came in and the were immediately helped. i found that very rude , the woman running the place saw me walking in. so i left the place and went next door to the competition, they also have a nice coffee and wat lekkers. i will never return back to this place."
"the food was very delicious and tasty. as an indian food lover, food was traditional and spicy, as can be expected. the service however was very poor, slow and not service oriented staff. a smile when dealing with customers can go a long way."
"we have recently moved from hilversum to arnhem. so we thought lets try indian food in arnhem. so we went to king of india and ordered chicken tikka, paneer tikka and rice. it was a take aw "
"went for dinner as a group. nice reasonably easy service. helpful staff. however food was too spicy. ordered vegetarian dishes mostly and found them having an extra yard of spice. they have only naan bread and not the roti. the naans were not cooked well and were not crisp, found it tough to digest.not coming back again!"
we have often been to indian restaurants. these visits were always nice. this restaurant was an alltime low. this for the following reaso 
"i went here after hearing people mention to me that theres also an indonesian take-away here -- i normally go to toko rinus (not in the centre but highly recommended). was disappointed. not too many choices, dry meat."
"some dishes were tasty, but not special. we did not know what to choose. information on the menu and from the staff was not very helpful."
"visited here with friends, as a non dutch speaker, there was no english menu but not an issue... google translate worked a treat. a lot of rice dishes, we opted for mixed meat dishes with various sides to share. meat was cooked well, moist and tasty. sides added to the enjoyment of the meal. service was slow. wine... one white one red. reasonable priced restauran "
"the was our third visit. we loved the previous visits very much, but this time it was pretty bad. we were not alone, but the place was not crowded either. nevertheless we had to wait 2 hours or even more for being served, the servants did not pay attention at all, the food was partly burned. we know the food can be great, but this evening everything went wrong, very frustrating because it was a special day we wanted to celebrate with a nice meal."
"good location close to nijmegen centraal station. nice atmosphere and friendly staff (although the service was a bit slow). overall, i had a fairly positive experience."
expensive for what it is. i went once for a drink with a friend and had a smoothie. for the price and the size of the smoothie i would have expected a lot more. service was also slow.
"we went there and everything took extremely long. first, the table wasnt cleared for solid ten minutes. it took another 15 minutes for my cappuccino to come and until my friends drink came, i had finished my cappuccino for a while. our food (sandwiches, nothing very complicated) took 50 minutes. as they finally arrived we at least got a sorry it took so long, haha. delicious, but terrible service."
"we had two sandwiches, both with different fillings. when served, we noticed one slice of bread had the filling and the other lay next on the plate. unfortunately there was not enough filling to spread over the second slice, and to place on t "
what poor service. over a hour before the starters arrive and that was only one out of 4. hardly anyone in the place. what is the chef doing? the lady serving also wouldn’t rush out the building if the place was on fire.
ate here a couple of times although the welcome was friendly and shown to a table straight away even without a reservation the service then slowed down substantially from bringing the menu to getting the bill. food was good including the naan breads and the portion just about right but quite expensive overall. an occasional treat but certainly not a regular one.
"the biggest disappointment was the food. nothing to say more. the service is fine, the staff is friendly."
took the butter chicken and the taste was  
india gate is a small restaurant between the railway station and the city centre of nijmeg 
"we arrived jolly, having made a reservation to a frosty welcome at a pretty much empty restaurant (alarm bells "
went for a evening dinner with friends. the food was average but what was appaling was the attitude of the staff and customers servi 
have eaten here a number of times. was initially good but lately seemed to have a very salty basis for their food. friendly enough service but really too much salt. will not go back since there are better indian restaurants in nijmegen
" from entering this restaurant the atmosphere, service and attitude of the staff was appalling. the only reason we ordered starters, were because we were told by our hotel, that the indian food was the best in the town. we would recommend that anyone considering going to this restaurant should not? it was awful!!!!! we did not order a main course."
"very standard indian restaurant with all the classic dishes. good but no surprises, except a massive bill."
fine location. pity the food was too salty for me. hot does not only mean more chilli! used to be better! dont think ill be back. there are better indian restaurants in nijmegen.
the restaurant is tiny and the tables are pretty crammed in. theres quite a good selection of dishes both meat and vegetarian. we ordered some wine which we sent back because although it wasnt corked it wasnt nice and they didnt quibble about it. service was a bit slow because there were only 2 waiting staff and it was fairly busy.
the worst place we ever been to.. waiters were so rude.. 
the food is good. but their behaviour isnt appreciable though. i doubt whther they r indian too. i have been to other indian restrau in other countries too and they always had given us warm welcome but here it was out of questio 
"first time when we visited this restaurant, we could clearly see the difference in the way they were treating asian and local people. i doubt if they are really indian. they were doing unwanted arguments in a very ironical way as if we were obliged to be there. except the lady everyone else seem to have pathetic attitud "
"indian gate is an ok indian restaurant, but the dishes are bland, no comparison the nice spicy indian food i learned to appreciate in restaurants in london and even california."
